"Since the late 1970s, two men have emerged as the most powerful and most dangerous drug lords in the world. Pablo Escobar, a farmer's son from rural Colombia, and Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, a product of Mexico's rugged Sierra Madre Mountains, have delivered immeasurable amounts of cocaine and other drugs to the world during their respective reigns. In doing so, they've amassed obscene amounts of wealth - and exposed the world to unimaginable levels of terror. While a direct comparison of Escobar's Medellin cartel and Guzman's Sinaloa Federation is difficult - they've dealt with different products, different competition, and different markets - looking at the two groups' leaders side by side gives some idea of their power and influence. Samantha Lee/Business Insider Pablo Escobar Born to a humble farming family near the city of Medellin in north-central Colombia, Pablo Escobar started his career committing various petty crimes. He graduated to smuggling thereafter and soon began carting shipments of marijuana. By the late 1970s, he and several associates had begun trafficking cocaine out of Colombia (which remains one of the main cocaine producers in the world) and, by the early 1980s, their Medellin cartel was shipping hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of cocaine north to the voracious US market. Sebastian Marroquin/Sins of my Father Pablo Escobar with his son, posing in front of the White House in 1981. While Escobar's income and wealth are hard to measure, it's believed that he was raking in $420 million a week by the mid-1980s, which would amount to roughly $22 billion a year. By the end of that decade, he was supplying 80% of the world's cocaine - and smuggling 15 tons of it into the US every day. He spent lavishly on himself and his family and was also a patron of local causes - building apartments, soccer fields, and handing out cash to the poor. These acts of charity won him popular support and bolstered his image as a man of the people. ""Pablo was earning so much that each year we would write off 10% of the money because the rats would eat it in storage or it would be damaged by water or lost,"" Escobar's brother, Roberto, wrote in a 2009 book . Escobar's illicit empire attracted the attention of the Colombian government, which attempted to shut his operations down. Clashes between the government and drug traffickers unleashed a years-long wave of violence on Colombia. The Colombian government, with US assistance, deployed a special force to bring him down (though that force was badly bloodied in their first encounter with the cartel). By mid-1991, the government's campaign forced Escobar to concede, and he negotiated an agreement that allowed him to lock himself up in a jail of his own design in the highlands near Medellin. Colombian Government Photo By mid-1992, evidence that Escobar was conducting cartel activity from his prison compelled the government to try to apprehend him; instead, Escobar fled the prison and went on the run. During this time, he and his family traveled from hideout to hideout, never staying in the same place for more than two days. At one point, Escobar torched $2 million in cash to help his family stave off cold weather. He eventually separated from his family, hiding out on his own. On December 2, 1993, his luck ran out . Colombian security forces - believed to be working with Los Pepes, a vigilante group that was also tracking Escobar - converged on the Medellin home where he was staying. When they burst through the door, Escobar scrambled out onto the rooftop. Like many of the details of his life, it remains unclear who fired the shot that killed the most powerful - and most dangerous - drug lord in the world. Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman While Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is not the first drug baron to emerge from the Sierra Madre Mountains of the Sinaloa state in northwestern Mexico, the state's namesake cartel rose to global standing under his watch. REUTERS/Henry Romero Guzman after his February 2014 arrest. As the head of the Sinaloa cartel, Guzman oversees marijuana and poppy cultivation that covers more than 23,000 miles within Mexico, an area larger than Costa Rica, as well as a network that has operatives in 17 of Mexico's 32 states and reportedly operates in nearly 50 countries, including an extensive network in the US. The cartel is believed to control 35% of the cocaine produced in Colombia (the world's largest producer of the drug) and, according to the DEA, in 2013 it supplied ""80% of the heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine"" flowing to the Chicago region of the US each year. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz Sinaloa's distribution network in the US. The Sinaloa cartel is also believed to have an immense international footprint. Cartel activity has been reported in Australia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines in recent years. And, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Latin American organizations like Sinaloa are looking to expand their operations into new markets, using trafficking routes through Africa and Asia. The World Drug Report ""El Chapo"" is no stranger to law enforcement, either. In 1993, not long after he ascended to Sinaloa's upper ranks, Guzman was arrested in Guatemala - where he had fled after a cartel shootout in Guadalajara killed a Catholic Cardinal - and locked up in a Mexican prison. There he stayed until 2001, when he escaped, reportedly by hiding in a laundry cart . He was on the run for 13 years before he was caught in Mazatlan, on the Sinaloa coast, in February 2014. Seventeen months later (a period of incarceration that didn't interrupt his managerial duties ), he escaped again in spectacular fashion . REUTERS/Edgard Garrido Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is escorted by soldiers during a presentation at the hangar belonging to the office of the Attorney General in Mexico City, Mexico January 8, 2016. After six months on the run, Guzman was recaptured in early January in Los Mochis, a city in Sinaloa state, not far from where he was born. The drama around him has not slacked since he was rejailed. His legal team has filed multiple appeals to his sentence, and Guzman himself has reportedly made overtures about cutting a deal with US authorities . His wife has taken to the airwaves to decry his treatment in jail. PBS Frontline/Drug Lord: The Legend of Shorty El Chapo's mother, Consuelo Loera. Amid the legal wrangling, worries about another escape persist. In early May, Guzman was shuttled from his cell at a prison in central Mexico to another facility outside of Ciudad Juarez. The move was reportedly prompted by a sudden blackout at the jail holding him, which likely spooked many high-level Mexican officials who would be humiliated by another breakout. The Mexican government approved Guzman's extradition to US courts in Texas and California in late May, and his lawyers have responded with more appeals . Guzman remains locked up, where he is presumably safe, though that may not be the case for his associates at home in Sinaloa. In mid-June, scores of armed men descended on Guzman's mother's home in central Sinaloa state. The attack left several people dead, and may have been launched by a cartel with which Sinaloa has long feuded.

The Index that just came out yesterday, saw a small 1.9 point rise. The Index is now up to 90.8. The Optimism Index number went up, so youre thinking, it has to be good news. Well not so fast. With all such indices and surveys, it all depends on the perspective and context. Yes, its positive news, but if I had to sum it up, Id say its hardly rousing. The NFIB notes that survey results are on a par with 2008. Thats good because theres been a bounce back. But its bad in the sense that the results are actually below small business optimism levels for both the 1991-92 and 2001-02 recessions. The Small Business Optimism Index chart tells the tale: But heres the rub. That improvement hasnt made its way to small businesses yet. over most of the past year, 2012. And according to the NFIBs report, small business sales numbers are still weak. Is it any wonder that optimism is anemic? Some of the reason may be all the fear mongering coming out of Washington  and all the talk about raising government spending. Paying for that spending disproportionately hits small business owners in the form of taxes  at least, thats what many business owners believe, no matter what the pundits and politicians try to tell us. than for the rest of the population, according to a Gallup poll. In a prepared statement, NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg said: Here are some additional results highlighted by the NFIB release: Results are based on responses by 870 NFIB-member small businesses surveyed randomly during the month of February. The NFIB is a nonprofit founded in 1943, that advocates on behalf of small businesses. The organization represents small businesses of many sizes, from solo entrepreneurs to those with several hundred employees. The typical NFIB member employs 10 people and reports gross sales of $500,000 a year. .","A $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. by tech giant Google is just the latest sign of a general mobile trend.

President Obama and his administration have been putting the heat on lenders. So far, however, that has not turned the credit situation around. The franchise industry  where franchisees get a business in a box setup, is also feeling the pinch. Franchises known to have a proven system for success used to get fairly quick loan approvals. These days, though, they arent getting approved like they used to. A recent article in Franchising World magazine states that: Until recently, all the lenders that Ive ever worked with (to help get my franchise candidates a small business loan) have been pretty easy to work with, and were looking for ways to approve the loans. As a matter of fact, over a period of a number of years, I only remember two or three instances in which candidates of mine were ever turned down for a loan. Things are a lot different now. Since traditional ways of obtaining start-up loans and expansion loans arent working anymore, Im thinking that its time for some deep exploration of some non-traditional routes. Folks that are finding it difficult to get the approved stamp on their loan applications are starting to approach specialty lenders. The Wall Street Journals Emily Maltby not long ao posted an article about these types of lenders, suggesting that: She gave an example of , but was turned down numerous times by conventional lenders.

An annual survey conducted by The UPS Store found that 94 percent of Americans believe shopping at small businesses is important. And 90 percent of the people responding to The UPS Store survey believe that small businesses are important to the economy. In an official release announcing the results of the survey, UPS Store Inc. President Tim Davis : In addition to those numbers, The UPS Store found that more Americans are willing to spend more and go further to support small businesses in their communities. The survey found that the number of people who paid more in order to support a small business increased by 41 percent between 2013 and 2014. The survey also found that the number of respondents who said they traveled out of their way to support a small business increased by 36 percent over the same period. Respondents say the local factor plays the biggest role. The UPS Store found 70 percent of those who support small businesses believe it makes a positive impact on the local community. Nearly two-thirds also said they believe shopping small supports local people. Just over half said they buy from small businesses because they believe the money stays local. The UPS Store has also created an graphic showing off the key results of the survey. Small business customers believe theyre getting better customer service when they frequent smaller establishments, too. And they say theyll also find more unique products and often better quality products when they shop small, the survey reveals.","Light in your office or in your brick and mortar store may have a lot more impact on your business than you realize. In fact, bright light helps market products, but it may have a very different effect on decisions in the workplace, a study says. Researchers at the University of Torontos Rotman School of Management say evidence suggests that sunny days tend to make people more optimistic and full of well-being. However, seemingly contradictory data shows sunny days can also intensify the depressed outlook already present in people who are prone to depression. In a summary of the studys findings Red Orbit : So, to review, what researchers found was not that subjects were more positive under bright lights. Rather, the conclusion seems to indicate that brighter lighting conditions bring out more intense emotions. And, researchers say there are some practical business conclusions that can be drawn from all this. For example, one researcher suggests that when marketing products with a high emotional impact  say flowers, engagement rings etc.  higher light levels might make sense. On the other hand, researchers say, in an office environment where important business decisions are being made, you may not want people on an emotional tear. Instead, consider turning down the lighting level in your business office to mellow things out. Knowing the effect light levels have on your customers, clients and employers gives you a great advantage. Studying the environments that make your customers more willing to buy and your workers better able to make good decisions should make managing your entire business much easier in the long run.","Instagram is a social channel that lets you snap photos (and now video), add creative filters and share them with your followers.

John says the but if messages are so easy to spread, why do small business owners seem to struggle with marketing? Could it be our mindset? Even though effective marketing is as fundamental to our businesses as the quality of the product or service that we provide, we small business owners have a tendency to put marketing on the back burner. Below are 3 ways to look at marketing to help us shift our mindset. Some of us think of safe marketing as So you toss an ad in the local paper and the Yellow Pages. You pass out some business cards, tell a few friends, hand out some flyers and call it day. You feel kind of good because you did and didnt waste your money (hopefully). But its the cost of effective marketing that saves your business (and by cost I mean the time it takes to strategize. Hit-and-miss-marketing isnt good for business in the long run). In my opinion, the only is . Does anybody care about what you are talking about? Does it matter to your target market? Communicating a message that nobody cares about is the worst feeling in the worldand its bad for business. A quick way to get started in the right direction is to pay attention to whats happening in the world around you. Find the events that your target customers care about or would care about if they knew about them. What are the holidays, tournaments and major events that affect them? Discover this, and then plan your marketing around helping your clients and prospects celebrate, acknowledge or participate in that event. Relevant marketing also demands that you know where your people (target market) are. Is your target market reading the Yellow Pages? If they are, then buy that ad. Or do they go to Google to search addresses and phone numbers? If they go to the Web for local information, then . Choose to be relevant with your marketing. Talk about what your target customers care about and make sure your information is listed in the key places that they naturally go to.

Effective marketing is strategic and it takes a lot of effort upfront ","The Obama Administrations plans to increase taxes in 2013 wont hit all small business owners equally. Owners of successful S-corps and partnerships, it turns out, are most likely to face a tax increase. The economic impact of the administrations tax plans, particularly their impact on small business is a major political issue. Ernst & Young LLP just released a report, Long-Run Macroeconomic Impact of Increasing Tax Rates on High-IncomeTaxpayers in 2013, commissioned by several business groups, which shows that the tax increases that the President has put in place or would like to put in place in 2013 would have long term negative effects on the economy, including cutting output by $200 billion and eliminating 710,000 jobs. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has . In particular, they argue, few small businesses will be affected by the tax increase. Citing a recent Treasury Department study, , they explain that less than 3 percent of small business owners are taxed in the top two brackets (which would face tax increases under the plan) when small business is defined as the Treasury Department does in its study. I have pointed out that , with the Democrats concentrating on the number of small business owners affected by the tax increase and the Republicans stressing the impact on income and employment. I dont want to rehash what I have written about before, nor do I want to discuss whether true small businesses are affected by the tax increase; whether the wealthy would bear more than their fair share of the increase; or whether tax increases really lead small business owners to invest and hire less, all of which have been addressed by others. I just want to point out that the Presidents tax plans would affect different types of small business owners differently. Many more small business owners who run partnerships and Sub Chapter S corporations will face higher taxes than small business owners who run sole proprietorships. Thats because S-Corps and partnerships tend to generate more income. Of the 30.2 million pass through businesses that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates are in operation in the United States, 77 percent are sole proprietorships. According to the Ernst and Young report, only 2 percent of sole proprietors have income that would subject them to higher taxes under the administrations plan. By contrast, Ernst and Young estimates that 13 percent of Sub Chapter S corporation owners and 12 percent of partnership owners will pay higher taxes if all the proposed changes go through. The effects on income are even more extreme because the income of S Corps and partnerships is more skewed than the income of sole proprietorships. Ernst and Youngs analysis shows that the tax increases will hit only 24 percent of sole proprietorship income, but 73 percent of S Corp income and 70 percent of partnership income.","Here are some phrases you should avoid using in your emails, unless you want to come across as unprofessional, and perhaps even rude, to the recipient: The phrase I dont know is the pinnacle of unprofessionalism as it conveys that the writer is bluntly washing their hands away from the work at hand and is not even willing to find a solution to it. The ideal phrase should be: I will get back to you on that subject matter/issue/topic or That is exactly what we are looking to resolve/find out/figure out. You are certainly not expected to know everything, but reassure the other person that you will find out what is needed or that you are working towards finding out what you dont know. Doing this helps you come across as an efficient and hardworking professional. When you have to follow up, discuss or enquire about a particular issue that you dont know about, you certainly need the time to do so. Asking the person if that is okay can put them off. If the person replies that its not okay, it will make the conversation unproductive and it heads nowhere. Not only does it make you look unprofessional, but it also makes it seem like you are . When you know that a particular matter will not be possible or needs time, its right to form a crisp reply and end it there without any further words. If the person is not comfortable with the decision, then run it though your boss and respond accordingly. Whether you have a junior-level title or a senior-level title, its arrogant to start an email with such a sentence. If you have a junior-level designation, it is better not to include it at all because it comes across as brash and superficial to potential clients and higher management. Never begin an email with the word hey. It is for a professional setting and gives the reader the impression that you are a random person who has appeared form nowhere. A better way to introduce yourself is by saying Hello or I am *name* from *name of department *. It inspires more confidence and gives the impression that you were invited to be included in this conversation. Anything less than a Thank you is righteously believed to be either sarcastic or flippant. The word thanks is slightly harsh as well. Refrain from using it even verbally in the office environment. Fine is a word that can be interpreted in many ways. It could mean fine in the manner of quality, or it could mean the work is average and not better. So, instead of confusing the reader with a colloquial term, it is better and more professional to be specific in all the words you use. Instead of fine, say that is/was a good effort or that is/was not up to the mark. Saying Im sorry sounds offhand and almost like you dont mean it at all. Always keep in mind that when you need to apologise, it is better done in person. However, if you have to type it out in an email before that, say something like My sincere apologies for the inconvenience, let us make it up to you by *doing something else*. Always apologise and follow it up with a small service that you can extend to the other party with a genuine intention. Avoid using adverbs like these in professional emails should be fact-based and not express emotion or emphasise a feeling. For instance, when you want to say Im extremely busy this week, instead say, I have a tight schedule this week. While we all know you are bound to get tired after working long hours, saying it in an email is like telling people that you cant manage your work life. Successful people know how to work hard and . Exclamation points will be the death of your professional image in a work environment. Do not use or overuse them at all if you can help it. It looks very childlike, and using them could send mixed signs to the receiver. Exclamation points are used when you want to tone up your virtual voice or say something in an authoritative manner. While you may think that you sound like a proactive and efficient individual, it just may happen that you come across as pompous and rude. Mean well, write smart and sound sincere, and things will work in your favour.","For small-business owners, conducting a mid-year check-in is an essential part of staying on track for meeting annual revenue and growth goals. But a mid-year review can also be an effective risk-management tool to help keep your business safe from the various forces that can throw it off track. Below are key questions to include in your business review to ensure that youre adequately managing the risks that affect your business. As with any mid-year review, half the battle is setting aside time to analyze your business and develop an action plan for items you need to work on. Get serious about latter portion of 2013 by setting aside a half day in the coming weeks to spend analyzing the current state of your company. When you do, take the time to consider these questions that focus on risk management. In mid June, your second installment of estimated quarterly taxes is due. But if your revenue has increased since your initial projections, your tax liability might have changed, too. To make sure you dont incur underpayment penalties, take time during your mid-year check-in to reexamine your calculations. Dedicating a few minutes to crunching these numbers has the potential to save you time, energy, and unnecessary penalties when youre filing your taxes next year. A quick safety audit of your business premises will alert you to any hazards that could lead to property damage, bodily injury, or lawsuits for the people you serve and employ. Check batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, verify that furniture and decorative items are secure and unlikely to cause accidents, and make sure that light fixtures provide adequate illumination. A little preventative work now can save you from a customer injury that leads to a costly lawsuit down the road. These days, its almost impossible to run a business without handling client data of some kind. And if you have access to customer information, youre at risk for having it compromised in a data breach. Minimizing your chances of being victimized requires a multi-pronged approach: Encrypt data, use strong passwords, change your passwords regularly, limit employee access to sensitive data, install antivirus software on your machines, and invest in a that will cover your costs if and when a data breach does happen. Small businesses are big targets and if youve skipped one or more of these steps, theres no better time than the present to put protective measures in place. In many cases, client lawsuits are triggered not by sloppy or incomplete work but by clients who feel as if their needs havent been met or their concerns havent been addressed. One way to minimize the likelihood of dissatisfied clients is to institute a check-in strategy that includes communication during all phases of a project. Having a standard policy for touching base allows you to identify areas of concern and address problems when theyre small. Without such a policy, youll likely only hear about problems when theyve escalated and are harder and more time-consuming to deal with. Your communication system doesnt have to be complicated: Even pre-written emails sent at specific stages in your projects can work by demonstrating to your clients that youre thinking about them and available to address their concerns. Its never fun to be blindsided by a disruptive innovation from one of your biggest rivals. A new, out-of-the-blue product or service launch by one of your rivals can hurt both your credibility and your revenue. During your mid-year review, set aside some time to research your competition (and develop a schedule for doing this on a regular basis if you arent already). At worst, youll find out about an upcoming challenge sooner than you might have; at best, youll get some great ideas you can adapt for your own business. Hurricane Sandy served as an unpleasant reminder about how serious weather events can affect small businesses. But now that the Super Storm has faded from headlines, the urgency behind disaster management plans has also sputtered. If you dont have a plan in place for what youll do in the event of a tornado, hurricane, flood, earthquake, fire or power outage, take some time to sketch out the details. Remember to include , saving or preserving your inventory, and financing your ongoing business expenses if your revenue is disrupted. (Business Interruption Insurance might be able to help with the latter.) Finally, take a look at the limits and exclusions on your Business Liability Insurance policies. If you havent updated them in six months or more and have experienced any business changes in that time (e.g., moving to a new building, increasing revenue, offering new services or products, hiring new employees, etc.), theres a good chance that your policies dont fully cover you. A brief phone call to your insurance agent should clarify whether you need an update to your insurance policies. Its all too easy to treat risk management as an afterthought while focusing primarily on more traditional revenue-boosting measures. In reality, though, a robust risk management plan is essential to maintaining steady revenue increases. After all, nothing drains a businesss assets faster than an unexpected catastrophe or disaster that demands large-scale repairs or a lawsuit that requires extensive time and money to defend. If youre having trouble finding time to update your risk management plan, think of it as one of the safeguards you put in place to shield the revenue youve worked so hard to earn.

The best way to make it reach its target audience is to include it on product category pages and site search result pages in order to promote them. Videos are meant to demonstrate how a product works, interacts, behaves and fits into customers needs.

Well, thats pretty close to what happened to a website called , a site which allows its readers to anonymously upload content of a somewhatuh, salacious nature. A former cheerleader sued the website for content posted by its visitors and won an initial verdict recently. Heres the story as we understand it from (PDF). Between October and December of 2009, visitors to the site uploaded several posts about former Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader and Kentucky high school teacher Sarah Jones. The posts included photos and made numerous potentially libelous observations about Jones personal life to which site founder and online entrepreneur Nik Richie (pictured above) added additional editorial comment. After repeated emails from Jones and her father asking to have the posts taken down, Jones finally sued claiming defamation under the Communications Decency Act. A court eventually agreed awarding Jones $38,000 in compensatory damages and $300,000 in punitive damages. To be sure, Richie is not necessarily a model others might aspire to. His site is popular  but notorious. In this video clip from the Dr. Phil show, he defends his business, explains his target market and confronts one of the people who claims her life has been destroyed by his site: Though many entrepreneurs may not envy or might even be offended by the brand he has created, the initial ruling should be cause for concern. If upheld, it would have set a dangerous precedent that website operators could be held responsible for any content uploaded to their sites, even by a third person. This might include even comments shared via social media communities. But, of course, this isnt the end of the story. From the beginning, Richie and his company, Dirty World Entertainment Recordings LLC, had argued that Section 230 of the act defended website operators from liability in the case of third party content. In a recent ruling reversing the earlier court decision, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. Writing for the court, Judge Julia Smith Gibbons explained: Were not going to suggest that you let any of your readers post this kind of content to your website. But its nice to know no one should be able to bankrupt you or your business for something irresponsible one of your visitors might happen to post on your blog or Facebook fan site.","Are you looking to enhance your website?

The image below shows just some of the many options you can use to configure the data that Google Analytics does, or does not, track, a truly useful feature for measuring website performance and marketing results. Like the previous plugin, the plugin assures that the Google Analytics tool tracks your site activity.

A shown below, creating and displaying ads using the plugin is as easy as 1-2-3: create ad blocks, determine where theyre going to show on a post or page and set display options that effect when and where ads are displayed. As with all companies, Google is very careful of fraud. If they detect too many clicks on ads coming from your site, clicks that dont match the traffic your site receives, they may opt to exclude your site from the AdSense program, meaning youd miss out on the extra income generated by ads. The Google AdSense Click-Fraud Monitoring plugin reduces this risk by monitoring the AdSense activity on your site. If it notes certain patterns, such as a visitor from the same IP address clicking on your ads over and over, it can take an action like blocking that visitor from accessing your site. Its like having the neighborhood watch on your side.

Too bad you did not have Anna Bernasek as a teacher. From her you would have discovered great connections between what you learn in class and what you encounter everyday. At least thats my imagination of Anna Bernasek as a teacher, based on how I understand her writing style in her wonderful book  . I came across the title while researching online news articles online on the aftermath of the 2008- 2009 financial crisis. A highly acclaimed economics journalist, Bernasek wrote a great book on economics that may get you to think about how integrity can be so essential to everyday dealings as well as branding, customer loyalty, profitability, and value creation. The book title includes the word economics, but Bernaseks comments do not sink into price-demand charts (though there are supporting data charts sprinkled throughout the text). Bernasek includes an excellent mix of familiar everyday items, such as how we rely on the milk supply chain for assurance of fresh milk, to the greater complexity of the financial markets. examines our reliance on integrity in many businesses, with a dedicated conversation on Toyota and its commitment to integrity in the quality of its vehicles. While American automakers focused on attractive features (or gimmicks) meant to stir the imagination of the average car buyer: Bernasek also explains about how Toyotas handling of a frame recall for the Tacoma pickup  buying back vehicles 1 1/2 times their worth in Kelly Blue Book  brought amazing customer response: Some turned around and bought another Toyota truck. Bernasek sums branding best: A brand is stored integrity. (An aside: Anna has also talked about Toyotas recent failings in her interviews  You can hear and see all her interviews ) A small business owner may think, Why should I read this? I know integrity is important to my business. Duh! with a side order of #Fail. But that kind of thinking overlooks the point of the book. makes a solid case for the degree in which we depend on integrity naturally, so much so that even when catastrophic events are managed well integrity becomes a useful asset. Bernaseks example of Toyotas ability to leverage integrity is timely given its recent highly publicized recalls. And given the companys successful first quarter earnings despite those recalls has shown, Bernasek is spot on it. While transparency and authenticity is mentioned in almost every book and blog on social media, provides a more holistic view, permitting an imaginative strategic-minded business reader to view integrity in his or her operations as a means to create value for customers and vendors. Bernasek believes integrity and trust creates value. Through economic examples she delves into how systems based on disclosure, norms, and accountability can work to an advantage. In the segment Calculating Getting Caught, for example, she explores statistics on vehicular safety, murder, and tax returns to show how disclosure, norms, and accountability should be to deter behavior instead of an all-encompassing punishment. More to the point in business, Bernasek believes that a system of integrity should be designed to work naturally to reinforce itself, promoting trust from all parties involved. An example is the customer service policy with LL Bean where its customers can return purchase for a full refund anytime. While the policy sets it apart from other retailers. LL Bean has found that customers who try to take advantage of its unlimited return policy in an unfair way are by far the minority. These kind of summations are awesome in their simplicity, and really makes you appreciate her points with respect to your own business practices and strategy. The ending chapter of the book focuses on how the financial markets should do better. This may not be particularly applicable for the immediate needs of a small business, but the subject does make for a nice read. The reader will find historical examples with an interesting subject fit, such as the 2008 Chinese Milk Scandal or Thomas Jeffersons quote on the mistrust of banks. With a book length of 186 pages, these asides certainly are not overwhelming nor so brief so their punch is lost in their purpose. You should pick up as a good tonic for how a business can get back to basics in establishing relationships based on trust. Readers will gain some personal perspective on brand building and customer service, because the examples raised connect individual integrity to the business community at large.

But do you know what HTML5 really is? Its important to know becauseHTML5 gives you more choices for a richer website, along with additional features. Youre likely to be hearing more about it. In fact, your next website may be written in HTML5. So youll want to be informed so you know enough to communicate properly with your Web developer, and consider your options for your website. HTML has been around since the beginning of the Internet. It is a language that serves as the building blocks for websites. HTML is the code that makes the images appear on the page, aligns those images, makes the text normal or bold, specifies what font the text should be, and much more. Since the 1990s, there have been 4 versions of HTML. We are now transitioning to version 5, which is what we are here to talk about today. Planning for HTML5 started back in 2004 by the , and a decade later, a relatively small number of websites use HTML5. This just goes to show that this process of upgrading HTML versions is not an overnight thing. It takes years (not to mention some ). But when HTML5 starts to become more widely used, HTML4 wont be pensioned off to a sunny island. HTML5 and HTML4 are built on top of one another and each will peacefully co-exist with one another, bringing their own set of features. HTML4 and HTML5 are co-existing right now.Some older browsers cant read HTML5, though. (To test if your browser is HTML5 compatible, .) So youre probably already asking what the benefits of the new HTML5 will be. Lets take a look at some key benefits. If you have an iOS device, then you will already know that the device is not able to use Flash. Android has its own Flash issues too. With Android you may need workarounds to see Flash elements of a site or a flash video. This is disruptive to the user experience if parts of a website remain off-limits due to a software incompatibility. HTML5 allows you to make fancier effects and animation, and fancier webpages, without the need for Flash. HTML5 can be seen as to Flash, not . HTML5 will have the potential of making websites faster and more interactive. Examples of this include playing streaming video on a website MUCH faster. Sites such as YouTube are already offering HTML5 video players. (However, as its not a default setting). Or it may mean playing audio on a website without plugins, using code to draw on a website (with your finger or a stylus pen), or dragging and dropping files onto a website (such as the uploading feature on WordPress). A great example of HTML5 is , a website run by Google, which shows some of the things that HTML5 is capable of. The examples on this site are made with something called WebGL, and this is a HTML5-related technology which creates 3D objects and animations. Semantic markup is not a creation of HTML5  it has been around for a while now  but HTML5 improves upon it. What is semantic markup? Lets try to break it down without getting too technical and getting lost in the details. In the old days, a website had information but there was no way for a search engine to make sense of that information. It merely indexed what it found but there was no context attached to give that information any meaning. A phone number was just a string of random numbers. With semantic markup however, data is interpreted in its proper context, so a phone number is identified as a phone number, the opening times of shops are identified as shop opening times, and so on. This makes search engines able to better understand your queries and deliver more accurate information. So you could ask Google when Walmart in your area closes, and it will bring up the times. Perhaps the most well known semantic markup example is . Whenever you search for something on Google, blog posts and articles often come up with the photo of the author to the left. Also, say youre looking for a law firm in New York? Semantic markup on search engines now has the contact details, along with a marker leading you to a Google map for directions. You can even read reviews, and view the companys Google Plus page. So semantic markup has the potential to make the web much more useful. Semantic markup can also include video, testimonials, and details of products for sale. And remember, adding Google Authorship to get your picture next to your articles in the search results is easy. Google explains it all . To get some other things into your site, Search Engine Land which details features such as marking up the address, contact details, payment types accepted, and hours of operation, on your site. That gives a taste of what kind of data you can make show up in the search results about your business. So the question youre probably now asking is what do I need to do?. The first thing to stress is that you dont to do anything right now. Your website may go along perfectly fine without HTML5. But if you have a business which heavily relies on an online or mobile presence, it wont hurt to start planning and going over options with your Web developer. Consider what features you need and how they could help your business. HTML5 may or may not be the right choice to bring those features to your online presence. But keep in mind that it might be counterproductive to be cutting edge if your customers arent there yet.The CTO of Small Business Trends, Leland McFarland, has some advice on the whole HTML5 issue: Your Analytics data for your website (such as Google Analytics) should be able to tell you the kinds of browsers and devices your audience primarily uses. That should give some idea of what your audiences needs are. One of your first considerations should be delivering what they want and need. But also consider the kind of new audience youd attract. For example, HTML5 might be able to draw in and retain more people using Apple devices.","Tax time is almost here.And as with almost anything else in your small business, there are apps designed to get you through it.

Have you ever felt the need to satiate your taste buds with a taste of a piping hot zinger burger? Well you would have, if youve ever been to KFC. A haven for , theres lot to take away from KFC other than just the mouth-watering taste that lingers at the tip of your tongue and the hearty feeling of a full stomach. Behind the freshness and the crunchiness of the chicken that we bite into are years of sweat and blood, shed by Colonel Sanders. Sitting under a tree and contemplating suicide, Colonel Sanders was busy writing his will. Reminiscent of the apple falling on Newtons head, inspiration struck. Only this time, the catalyst wasnt tangible. Only an abstract idea for making chicken in a novel way flew into his head. Seized by the urge to act, Colonel Sanders borrowed $87 of his social security cheque, bought and fried some chicken using his unique recipe, and started selling it in Kentucky. The rest is history!! Here are five lessons we can draw from the Colonels journey: The epitome of success past ones prime, Colonel Sanders tasted success fairly late in his life. It was only when he was on the verge of saying goodbye to this world that his love for cooking dawned upon him. Finding his true calling, he pursued it with passion and founded an enterprise that shook the food industry. Starting a venture at the age of 65, he proved the saying: The same applies to an . Like age, other factors like the lack of skills, health issues and the fear of failure hold us back from going after our passion. It is necessary for an entrepreneur to jettison all the inhibitions that he/she has been plagued by, in order to be successful.

Switching jobs since the age of seven, when he started work on a farm, Sanders never had much success with his professions. In fact, Sanders was terrible at making decisions and used to make unwise business gambles. Its no different with an entrepreneur. With lurking around every corner, each entrepreneur goes through a lot of rough patches in his/her career. These are times when you will doubt yourself, your decisions, and the path youre currently heading down, but it is just a matter of patience and self-belief. The best way to sail through such times is to learn from your own mistakes instead of mulling over them. Being unique and coming up with innovative solutions to solve problems efficiently is what sets most successful entrepreneurs apart. Colonel Sanders originally prepared his chicken in an iron skillet but soon realised that it wasnt efficient in a restaurant setting. Determined to reduce the waiting time of customers, Sanders adopted the usage of pressure fryer and modified his cooking procedure. In todays world, with numerous competitors in each business,mainstream solutions are going obsolete, with problems becoming more complex on a daily basis. The only way to gain an edge over your opponents is to try out something different. Not only was his cooking technique unique but the recipe he used was in itself quite interesting. KFC boasts of a secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices thats responsible for its worldwide fame. Entrepreneurs should also be prepared to take and come out of their comfort zone. At the age of 65, when people get senile and accustomed to taking rests and being immobile, Colonel Sanders discovered his passion. Eager to make a dent in this world and do something that he loves, Sanders bought all the ingredients and started making and selling fried chicken all over Kentucky. Things never got any easier even after he found his fervour for cooking. His pole star was set, but it was still a long path to go, filled with thorns to prick and potholes to make him falter. When he went around selling his chicken, people mocked him for his attire of white shirts and white pants, but Sanders seemed to be immune to those discouragements. Finally, at the age of 74, Sanders sold KFC for $2 million to a group of investors. Theres nothing like an overnight success story. Every entrepreneur should be willing to take risks and sport the will to see a project to its completion, in order to reach success. Even though Sanders story is a quintessential rags-to-riches story, the lessons learnt are quite different. Battling age, he tapped into an unprecedented repository of energy which fuelled him to go and start his own company. Courtesy the viral taste of his fried chicken, the chain grew rapidly and turned into a franchise soon. At the age of 74, Sanders contended that he had achieved some success in his life, sold KFC, and passed away at the age of 90. While you might not leave a trace of Sanders fried chicken on your plate, he has for sure left a trace of his legacy in everyones heart.

India has already deployed eight of the long-range P-8I aircraft to track submarine movements in the Indian Ocean and on Wednesday exercised an option for four more, two defence ministry officials and an industry source told Reuters. ""It's a follow-on order, it was signed today,"" a defence ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to make announcements on procurements. A second defence official confirmed the value of the contract at about $1 billion and said the aircraft were  expected to enter service over the next three years.  Amrita Dhindsa, a spokeswoman for Boeing defence, space, and security in India, said she was not in a position to say anything on the contract and referred all questions to the defence ministry. But she said the P81 was an aircraft used for not only for long-range patrol but was also equipped with Harpoon missiles for anti-submarine warfare. India has been building up its naval surveillance capabilities since China's navy expanded its reach and sent submarines, including a nuclear-powered boat that docked in Sri Lanka, across the Indian Ocean.  The deal, signed during a visit by the U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Frank Kendall, marks a further tightening of India's ties with the United States, which has emerged as a top arms supplier in recent years for India's largely Soviet-equipped military. A U.S. embassy spokesman was not immediately available for comment.  Boeing last year completed the delivery of the last of the aircraft under the previous order worth $2.1 billion, an industry source said. The Indian navy has deployed some of its P8-I aircraft to the remote Andaman and Nicobar islands near the Malacca Straits and two other routes into the Indian Ocean for military and commercial shipping.

Theres a challenge and opportunity in front of us and we have to change the way we do things. Over the years, I have realized that partners prefer to work with a vendor who invests in their overall growth. In addition to this, partners want to move into new markets and expect the vendor to help them move up the value chain. Its also the vendors responsibility to create new market leads, generate demand and enable partners to capitalize on new market opportunities. We believe in empowering our partners to move up the value chain to become a solutions provider in their own right.

The issue is known as net neutrality. And late last year, President Barack Obama called on the Federal Communications Commission to draft rules that would regulate broadband Internet access. These rules would make Internet access a public utility or resource, to The New York Times. Recently, the Wall Street Journal the FCC plans strong net neutrality rules. These rules would essentially treat Internet providers like telecommunications companies. The FCC is reportedly set to vote at its February meeting whether to draft regulations that prevent Internet providers from creating premium fast lanes and force them to treat all Internet data the same. The FCCs regular monthly meeting is set for Feb. 26, according to the commissions . No formal agenda has been released yet. Right now, though, both houses of Congress are busy trying to preempt the Presidents call for action. According to a Washington Post , Republican Senators have introduced a bill that would prevent ISPs, like cable companies, from creating these premium streams for websites. These sites like those belonging to small companies and startups, would have to pay more for faster content delivery. The bill is supposed to be a compromise with the President, who prefers the federal government police the ISPs to ensure that all data is delivered consistently at the same speed. If there were to be no change in laws, soon Internet providers could begin creating these avenues where sites that pay more get their data delivered quicker. In some cases, an Internet provider could completely block a service, like video streaming or VOIP. This would likely impact services like Netflix and other video streaming services. But it would also likely include domain registrars and Web host providers, who require fast Internet connections to deliver their products. For a small business owner, that could mean if a site or app you rely upon doesnt kick more money to Internet providers, it wont get priority speeds. That could slow down your operations or force them to change entirely. And moreover, that could mean your companys website could be delivered slower to your customers or potential customers, or not at all, supporters of net neutrality say.

However, more than nine out of 10 Americans (92%) will not to keep their resolutions to lose weight, quit smoking, or find romance. It can be the same with the goals small business owners set for themselves to grow revenues or become more profitable. The number one reason why New Years resolutions fail isnt feasibility or a lack of motivation. It is easy to become overwhelmed by the goals you set for yourself in the course of the next year. Procrastination is a significant part of the problem. At the beginning of the year, people rationalize I have over half a year left to do what I said Id do. And when the summer months roll around, there is still enough time left in the year that you might not feel a real sense of urgency. Before you know it, the holidays roll around again, and yet the resolution has not been accomplished. For many people, this depressing chain of events recycles on a yearly basis because far-away deadlines allow us to be slack on execution. Give yourself too much time and you will procrastinate. Its human nature, write Brian P. Moran and Michael Lennington, co-authors of , Instead, Moran and Lennington advocate setting realistic deadlines that will be better motivators to take action. Success is all of the little things you do throughout the year to make your goals happen, they explain. I always advise taking a look at smaller chunks of time when setting goals for a small business. One can compare January to the previous month of December or to January a year ago to gauge what direction the company is heading. Setting a goal of 50 percent growth in a year is noble, but it can be daunting. A smarter way is to plan smaller, more manageable and less overwhelming growth rates for each month of the year. By the time next December rolls around, the overall increase for the year may indeed be closer to the target. Every day should be filled with important, attainable goals. For example, one goal could be as simple as committing to reaching out to one new prospect each work day. Over the course of the year, this could add up to over 200 contacts. Even with a modest success rate of 2%, you could find yourself with four new accounts over the course of the year. If one or two of them are substantial new clients, you may indeed hit projected growth targets. By setting attainable goals and achieving little victories on a weekly basis, the outlook will seem brighter. And, as a result, your commitment to growth will grow throughout the year. In business, as in life, unexpected occurrences can put things out of whack. Natural disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy, set back thousands of small businesses. In 2013, the government shutdown had an unanticipated devastating effect on companies that directly and indirectly rely on federal spending. Machines break down. Key employees leave. New competition arrives in the marketplace. The key is to establish good habits and to have systems in place to spur business growth despite outside influences. Little things that mean a lot over the course of the year include: Smaller, monthly improvements will add up during the year. Committing to certain tasks and maintaining that commitment will manifest in greater overall performance. Do not set yourself up for failure like the people who aspire to drop 20 pounds or drop two dress sizes and then become depressed and discouraged when it doesnt happen within two months. The successful individuals will make it a point to drop one or two pounds a week over the course of 10-12 weeks. Set achievable goals, over small periods of time. They will be easier to reach, and as you reach each goal you will feel motivated because of your small successes. Continually reaching small achievable goals is the key to long-term success  this year and every year.","Twitter has proven without a shadow of a doubt that it is a durable player, platform and resource in the social media toolbox.

Because if you educate and inspire people, then you have a chance of motivating them, making a quality connection and eventuallyselling them something you offer that can help them. People still get rather confused about this, and have become quite savvy with how they think they can get your attention. Finding an email address and sending people emails with no permission, connection or relationship is notthe way to do it. This goes back to an etiquette that we all share the responsibility in. Not only is it against the CAN-SPAM law in the U.S. to send unsolicited emails, but it usually backfires. Sending unsolicited emails is a completely misplaced sales effort. But, its a totally different thing to post about how your latest newsletter just came out, andsend people to see a version of it online (where they can also subscribe if they like what they see). Or post a free downloadable ebook that people voluntarily give their email because they want to receive your great content. Use Twitter to lurepeople to a page on your site to voluntarily give their email in exchange for something of value. Then you have created a connection and can use it to market  because it is voluntary on the recipients part. Its flattering to people when you share their content. It gets their attention when you use their Twitter handle or share a link back to their website. Think of it as one of those famous 7 marketing touchesthat help you get and stay on the radar of prospects. Not only do you get the attention of those whose content you shared, but when you become known as a source of valuable and interesting information, you serve your followers better, too. But using others content without attribution is going to make it very difficult to developsales leads on Twitter or anywhere else. The Web is a remarkably small place. Plagiarism and stealing content (including images) without attribution are huge issues in the content space. Make sure your staff or any contractors helping you with social media, understand the difference between curating content (i.e., acknowledging where it came from) and stealing content (i.e., trying to pass something off as your own). One helps generate leads. The otherundermines your lead generation efforts. The most compelling and endearing way to engage people is by showing a story about your background. This could include challenges, successes and life experiences using content and images. Show and Tell is one of the oldest games in the world. is powerful, as the following eye-popping recent example from Volvo shows. It captured images of action star Jean-Claude Van Damme doing splits between a pair of Volvo Trucks. This created a lot of interest for Volvo: Take the initiative to give away the why of what you know and save the detailed how for your paying customers. The abundance mentality rather than scarcity mentality attracts people to you. The you have to give it away to keep it idea really works in marketing band sales. Create valuable content and share it. It attracts people. Generosity is a brand builder and a lead generator. A great example of this is Seth Godin who gives away amazing content freely to get people not only interested in him, but all the products and services he sells. I know you realize how important the experience is for consumers in everything we do. Or do you? When you create an emotional connection with others, you are more memorable. The most memorable thing about our user experience is not only that it over-delivers on value and learning, but that is fun. The idea that we can have fun in life and business should be part of what you communicate to your community and customers. So, make the experience of your website, blog, event, video, promotion, and social media full of your best ideas, personality and spirit and post them on Twitter. One of the fun social media tools that originated on Twitter are . Who could have ever thought that the # symbol would be reinvented to be a content organization and aggregation tool? Follow some of these basic concepts while engaging and sharing content. If you do, you can use Twitter to developsales leads. And this can be pretty awesome and consistent.","The media analyst is an authority on how the Internet and other emerging technologies are impacting the television, film, music and publishing industries. He/she advises clients on strategic issues such as customer acquisition and retention, audience segmentation, online revenue strategies and online programming and marketing.","Its interesting how a product or service that dominates a market becomes so familiar to consumers minds that its brand loses some of the cachet that motivates purchase. We often say Excel without ever saying spreadsheet, let alone Microsoft. And do you say tissue or Kleenex in your neck of the woods? The more ubiquitous something becomes, the more likely it is to be taken for granted. Google has such a challenge. Its successful domination of the search engine market has created a corporate directive to seek new growth opportunities and avoid losing marketplace buzz; magazine published a cover story on this buzz concern and Googles strategy to expand beyond its core business. The end result has been new offerings and incremental services like Caffeine, Chrome, and a little ol phone operating system called Android. Interestingly, one offering, Google Analytics, has similar dominance issues. It is on more than 62 percent of websites, yet its potency to manage marketing campaigns for small business owners is lost because many neglect to use its full capabilities. Enter Justin Cutroni, Director of Digital Intelligence at Webshare. A veteran among analytics consultants, Cutroni gets to the essence of marketing with , a new OReilly guide for Web analytics users. I met Justin years ago through a Google Analytics Boot Camp training at Epik One, a Vermont-based analytics company. A wonderful strategist, he provides the right experience level in this book for those looking to know more than What is a bounce rate? The book is structured in a similar informational vein as .

Cutroni tries to avoid bogged-down text  and succeeds. is a solid guide for small business technical workers who need a refresher on analytic technicalities, as well as an enlightener for business owners who need to understand how GA works and how the features link to your business. Cutroni covers it well at the beginning of Chapter 2: Admittedly Chapter 2 is ultra-brief, but subsequent chapters offer distinct applications of Google Analytics features that will enlighten long-time users and new practitioners alike, such as reviewing the evolution of the tagging script and providing an overview of mobile tracking code in Chapter 3. Cutroni highlights integrated uses of the features, such as an explanation of marketing campaign tagging. There are also a few discussions you wont find online, such as incorporating Google Analytics into CRMs and explaining of how tracking code functions on the server versus the browser. Topics such as the mobile tracking code expand on the functional impact to a site and give useful guidance such as the following comment: The segments on advanced techniques should be especially helpful for e-commerce companies and businesses with multiple domains. Here, Cutroni explains how analytics should work with existing systems, not just be a sole influence of decision: If a user is looking for more integration knowledge, the book does offer a number of excellent plug-in suggestions such as a code debugging tool, a regular expression diagnostic, and a keyword trend checker. There is a chapter dedicated to enterprise-level application that may not fit most small business needs, but its worth the page turns if your business is growing and more advanced measurement is on the horizon. Cutronis experience and honest tone comes through at every turn, so readers can rest assured that they are receiving digestable information. One note: does not cover the subject of APIs, so developers looking for coding development information should stick with the Google Code site for how-to instruction. There is also some script discussion, but only a bit more compared to .

There are more than 52 million U.S. Hispanics, Nielsen says, and they are the fastest- growing ethnic group in the country. By 2050, the Hispanic population in the U.S. will grow by 167 percent, compared to just 42 percent for the overall population. One thing that makes Latinos a particularly profitable market for small businesses is their youth. While the U.S. as a whole is graying, the median age of Hispanics in the U.S. is just 28 (almost 10 years younger than the overall median age of 37). More than half the U.S. Latino population is under 35 years old. That means Hispanics are in the market for: MediaPost reports that research firm IBISWorld has identified from the growing Hispanic population: If youre in one of these areas and want to reach Hispanic consumers, youd best get active on social media. MediaPost says Hispanics are avid social media users and that trend is likely to grow. As of February 2012, Hispanic Internet users visits to social networking sites rose 14 percent year-over-year. Hispanics are the fastest-growing U.S. ethnic group on Facebook and WordPress, and Hispanics over age 18 are 25 percent more likely to fan or follow brands on social media than the general population.

And those hubs can definitely have their benefits. But they arent automatically better than lesser known areas or cities that dont have huge existing startup communities. If you choose an area that doesnt have that existing community, you have the ability to make a big impact on building that community. The relationship between city and small business can be a mutually beneficial one. Kris Michell, president and CEO of the Downtown San Diego Partnership Entrepreneur about the benefit of building a strong business community in the city: The benefits of building a strong business communityare clear. But being part of an up-and-coming business community can benefit the startups involved as well. In such an environment, you could have more influence when it comes to shaping policies that impact local businesses. You could also work to bring other startups and businesses to the area, mentor them, and help build the startup community from the ground up. When youre able to have this kind of impact on the community around you, you can help build a community thats better suited to your needs. When you give to your community, your community tends to give back to you. So, by working to make genuine improvements, you can build an environment thats better suited to business growth in general. And your business could reap the benefits of those improvements as well. If you choose a place like Silicon Valley to start a business, many of those benefits are already available. You can easily access business mentors, find coworking spaces, and locate other resources to help run your business. But if you choose another location, you can be part of shaping that community and building the resources that you and other businesses can benefit from.","serves flatbread sandwiches along with22 different sauces to  dress them with  curbside. Yes, thats right. I said curbside. Sauca foods is cashing in on that . Now, if you live in the outlying suburbs, or in rural or semi-rural areas, you may never see a food truck except at lunchtime at the local plant or at events where large numbers congregate. But city dwellers and those who work in or near a city, especially large cities, are seeing these trucks with increasing frequency today. Even Taco Bell now has food trucks, replete with their own Twitter page with almost 10,000 Twitter followers. And that brings me to how I learned about Sauca foods. Recently I was one of the judges in the (along with my colleague , who was another judge).  The Challenge presented an interesting proposition. Businesses entered the challenge if they thought their business was a great candidate to be turned into a franchise. The winner won help in the form of services to help make that transformation to become a franchisor. While all the businesses that entered the competition appeared successful and worthy of recognition, Sauca foods stood out because of its intriguing brand and the food truck (or mobile restaurant) business concept. You can see how a food truck might lend itself to the franchise concept readily.

Bartmans son didnt want to be Batman or Superman; he wanted to be his own superhero for the party. So Bartman bought some fabric and stitched about ten custom superhero capes for her son and his friends. She thought that would be the end of it, but she received such a positive response that she just kept making more, Fox Business: She began selling the capes, which featured generic symbols like stars and lightning bolts, on Etsy and at local craft shows. She eventually started offering customizable capes to online customers, so kids could receive a cape with their own design or initials. By 2009, Bartman was selling about 1,000 capes per month so she decided to invest more into the business. She hired part-time help and moved the operation from her Farmington, Michigan home into a nearby office space. She even joined forces with a professional marketer in her office building and the two became business partners. Now, has 17 employees and manufactured 100,000 capes last year, bringing in $2.4 million in revenue. She has even sold capes to major corporations like Old Navy and Taco Bell for use at corporate events. Though Bartman didnt set out to achieve this level of success, the ideas behind Superfly Kids are so timeless that it shouldnt be surprising, looking back. Superheroes are so popular that multiple generations have taken to tying sheets and towels around their shoulders so they can pretend to fly and save the world. But the majority of capes and costumes sold by major retailers feature licensed characters like Batman and Superman. Bartmans creations dont include these big names. Instead, they allow kids to create their own superhero identities. In fact, custom superhero capes make up the majority of the companys sales. So by simply creating an item that she couldnt find in stores for her own son, Bartman tapped into a huge under served market. That market is made up of kids who arent satisfied with the status quo, but want to use their own imagination and creativity instead.","Mobile is the new digital frontier for any business looking to succeed. With more smartphones than people in the United States, and a greater percentage of your customers searching for businesses like yours on mobile devices, you cant afford not to have a presence thats optimized for mobile. But do you need a dedicated app for your small business? When it comes to mobile, most businesses offer a mobile website, a mobile app, or both. Its important to understand the difference between a website thats optimized for mobile and a mobile app, so you can make an informed decision about which is the best option for increasing your companys mobile presence. Just like a regular website, a mobile website is hosted on the Internet and accessed through a Web browser. Mobile visitors get to your website by clicking on a link on their device (such as from an email or search engine) or typing the address into a mobile browser. The difference is that mobile and mobile-optimized websites are designed for use with smaller screens and touch screens, instead of static desktop or laptop monitors. Mobile websites are often streamlined and simplified, with clean layouts and responsive design principles. In other words, theyre designed to translate seamlessly between devices, so that visitors have the same experience whether theyre viewing your website on an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Mini. automatically detect a viewers device settings and adapt appropriately to the display. Unlike websites, mobile applications (apps) are independent programs. They are downloaded and installed on a mobile device, rather than accessed through a browser. Typically, apps are obtained through an app marketplace like the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. Mobile apps can be free or paid, but most companies offer their apps free to consumers in favor of marketing value. Though mobile optimized websites and mobile apps are not the same thing, they typically offer the same featuresespecially those that make it easier for mobile device users to find and reach your small business. Some of these common features include: So, which mobile solution should your business choose? Beloware the advantages of each type of mobile access for your small business. With a , both PC and mobile device users can easily access and interact with your small business website. A mobile site can include all the features and elements of your regular version, but incorporate a mobile-friendly layout for better functionality and readability from a mobile device. Mobile websites help you to ensure a seamless experience for all of your visitors, no matter where or when they access your website. Because they are downloaded and installed, dedicated mobile apps can give your business the advantage of greater presence on customer devices. Mobile apps can give you more control, with features such as geo-targeted push notifications that alert device owners when theyre near your business, and data collection capacities that help you personalize your marketing. In addition, mobile apps are easier to access on devices, and can help to streamline marketing strategies such as text-based loyalty programs and single-platform mobile payments. Whether youre developing a mobile website or a mobile app, there are generally two avenues to choose: you can do it yourself with the many tools available for mobile optimized website and mobile app development, or work with a professional developer to create your mobile presence. The choice of whether to use a mobile site or a mobile app depends on the needs of your particular business, and the amount of emphasis you want to place on mobile marketing.","What you know about the traditional desktop computer, at least on the surfaceforget it.HPs latest entries on the market aim to change what a desktop computer looks like. The company recently . Both take the idea of a desktop tower and shrink it down into a mini desktop thats small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. In a an official release announcing the new devices, Mike Nash, HPs vice president of product management of Consumer Personal Systems, : First, the HP Pavilion Mini Desktop is just a little more than 2 inches tall and it weighs just 1.6 pounds.HP says that the desktop comes stocked running Windows 8.1 and supports a processor up to the Intel Core i3. Its also available with up to 1TB of storage, so despite its diminutive size, it still is a powerful little computer. The HP Pavilion Mini also supports the use of two monitors. And those monitors could include a television. The computer supports quad-HD quality pictures, too. And with that small size also comes a considerably smaller drain on your electricity usage. The HP Pavilion Mini uses just 45 watts of electricity. Its actually Energy Star certified. HP says that a traditional tower PC can use up to 250 watts to run. There are some drawbacks as far as things you might find on a more traditional tower but that simply wont fit on the HP Pavilion Mini. There will be no optical drive for DVDs and CDs. The computer is Bluetooth-enabled, however, so it can be connected to any other such device in your home. HP says the Pavilion Mini Desktop will be ready for sale on its website starting Jan. 14. It will be available at some retailers on Feb. 8. The computer comes with a keyboard and mouse. The monitor is not included. It will start at $319.99. Thats stocked with the Intel Pentium 3558U processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 500GB hard disk drive. The other device, the Stream Mini Desktop, starts at a lower price point, just $179.99. That computer is stocked with the Intel Celeron 2957U processor, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB SSD of storage. It, too, will be available first on the HP website soon and in some stores starting on Feb. 8 A webpage lets interested customers inquire for further information.","I was looking back at the topics Ive covered here onSmall Business Trendsrecently and had to laugh. Based on what Ive written about management issues, you might think Im a total softy. Well, thats kind of because I am. But I also recognize that being too nice as a business owner or manager can backfire on your company. There are many reasons behind nice girl/nice guy syndrome. Maybe youre too nice because you want everyone to like you. (I have a feeling women business owners are more likely to fall prey to this syndrome than men are.) Maybe you felt faceless as an employee at a big corporation and part of wanting to start your own business was creating a place where everyone had close personal relationships. Maybe you hated how your last boss treated you and vowed that your employees would feel like family. Or maybe you just arent confrontational, so you give in with a smile, rather than face up to problematic employees. Unfortunately, being too nice can have many negative consequences for your business. Some employees will take advantage of you and stop pulling their weight or doing their jobs. That means your business isnt as profitable and productive as it can be. Worse, when employees see others getting away with things, it snowballs and leads to either poor behavior (as everyone starts flaking off) or poor attitudes (as the employees picking up the slack resent the others who they see as getting special treatment). Ultimately, you could end up facing a lawsuit. Not to mention, if youre the one picking up the slack, youll start feeling resentful yourself and eventually burn outand thats not good for anyone. Take a step back and assess whether your policies, decisions and attitudes are negatively affecting your business. You might need to enlist an outside party, like your significant other or an advisor, or another manager in your business to give you their unvarnished opinion. If your customer service manager says something like, Yeah, you always give people time off when they ask without checking the schedule first and it really messes us up, then you might have a problem. Its great to let employees have flexibility and it also helps attract and retain new employees. But be sure you know where to draw the line so that business doesnt suffer. If youre struggling to make this shift, remind yourself that keeping your business healthy and thriving is what pays your employees salaries. So ultimately, youre doing them no favors when you weaken the company by being overly nice. I know many of you chafe at rules, and Im not saying employees need to fill out a form in triplicate to go to a doctors appointment. Its just that there needs to be some type of system other than, Go ask the boss who always says yes. Maybe only X number of people can work at home on any given day (rotate days among the staff so everyone gets a fair shot). Or maybe people need to ask a few days ahead if they can leave work early to see their kids school play (rather than informing you as they run out the door). Theres a difference between the employee asking to take a long lunch to go to an exercise class and the one asking to work at home so she can take care of her dying mother. Know when to bend the rules, even if it puts your business in a bind. Employees will never forget it.","Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images It's no secret Victoria's Secret Angels work hard to get into killer shape for the annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

Just in time for New York Fashion Week (which is going on as of now), Elsa Hosk caught up with StyleCaster to fill them in on what she eats in a day. She doesn't give away exact portions, but it's likely that she exercises ample portion control. Here's what she told StyleCaster: Breakfast: She said she ate eggs and bacon. Lunch: She said she ate a tomato-and-mozzarella panini and lentil soup. Dinner: She told the website that she went out to eat at a restaurant in New York City's trendy Tribeca called The Greek , and that she ordered a salad with potato, cucumber, and feta cheese, fried cheese, and chicken skewers with a rice pilaf. She said that's her favorite restaurant. The restaurant indicates if food is vegan, vegetarian, contains fish, or if it is gluten-free. (There appear to be no prices on the site, although it's likely it's quite pricey.) Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images She divulged a few contradictory diet practices; she said she's been consuming green smoothies for snacks during Fashion Week, and that her favorite snack is ""tzatziki and carrots, and smoothies."" However, she separately said that she doesn't snack but rather aims to ""survive."" Her words, via StyleCaster: ""I don't usually snack at all. I have main meals, and I make sure I eat a lot so I survive to the next meal."" She also is a huge fan of Juice Press, although she told StyleCaster she was not a fan of ""juice cleanses without solid food."" Unsurprisingly, she works out a ton.

The offer represents a massive 62 percent premium over Yahoos latest close. The offer will allow Yahoo shareholders to choose either cash or stock, although the total outlay will be half of each. Microsoft believes that the tie-up will give the companies needed scale in the online advertising space and is expecting at least $1 billion in synergies for the combined company. A letter sent from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to the Yahoo board, and included in the release (weve also posted it here in full ), presents the Redmond companys arguments for the deal, including the fact that Microsoft itself has seen strong growth as of late and that Yahoo shareholders should be happy trading in their shares for Microsoft shares. The company is also promising significant retention packages for key engineers and leaders. The letter also makes a reference to previous discussions between the companies, which explains the timing of the move: In February 2007, I received a letter from your Chairman indicating the view of the Yahoo! Board that now is not the right time from the perspective of our shareholders to enter into discussions regarding an acquisition transaction. According to that letter, the principal reason for this view was the Yahoo! Boards confidence in the potential upside if management successfully executed on a reformulated strategy based on certain operational initiatives, such as Project Panama, and a significant organizational realignment. A year has gone by, and the competitive situation has not improved . Staci adds : The Yahoo rumor mill this week included heightened suspicions that the Microsoft bid was already in house and the board of directors was refusing to go public. Turns out to be a mix of both  approaches had been made before but this is the formal bid thought already to be on the table. It is, as I just heard Andrew Ross Sorkin put it, Murdoch-ian  an offer that you might think would be nearly impossible to refuse or to nudge higher, although folks are already hard at work looking for an extra few dollars.  Yahoo shareholders are even more frustrated than those of Dow Jones (NYSE: NWS) and theres only one class of voters to reach. One interesting aspect: the offer represents a 62 percent premium over Thursdays close but it isnt that long ago that Yahoo was at $31 per share  Nov. 5, 2007. The 52-week high was $34.08. That makes this bid a bargain  as it stands. How does this fit in with Microsofts pocketbook? Its 14.4 percent of Microsofts $309 billion market cap before todays open. GOOG-AOL : This also adds urgency to another possible combo: Google-AOL (NYSE: TWX). Google (NSDQ: GOOG) already owns a five percent stake in AOL and a full acquisition would aid Google on the advertising side as well as with traction and traffic in portal areas it has yet to conquer such as finance and sports.

In the wrong hands, something as innocuous as a listing on Google Maps can cause irreparable damage to small businesses. Rene Bertagna owned and operated the , a restaurant dedicated to serving exotic meat dishes like lion and kangaroo for 40 years. But today  the restaurant is closed  and Bertagna blames Google. To be more precise, he blames his competitors for hacking Google Maps and altering his Google Placeslisting to mislead customers about the hours the restaurant was open. Bertagna has never owned a computer, and hardly knew what Google was, until he saw a 75% drop in customers over a single weekend a few years ago. He was clued in when a customer called to ask why his restaurant was closed three days a week. In fact, it was not. Bertagna claims the misinformation on Google Maps squeezed his customer traffic to nearly none until he decided to close the restaurant in 2013. Now, seeking retribution, hes (PDF) Google in federal court in Virginia in an attempt to force the search engine giant to pay attention. Its unfortunately all too easy for anyone to modify a Google Places entry, which can make for devastating results for small businesses. So could hacking of Google Maps really have killed this business? We were curious to see how easy it was to modify a business listing, so we picked a local hotels Google Places profile. After clicking edit details, we were taken here: How easy would it have been to say this place was closed or change the marker for the location? We have no ill intent, of course, so we left the listing alone. But there are plenty of examples of businesses who claim to have had their profiles on Google hacked to their detriment, as recently . Were not even sure why Google allows just anyone to edit a profile, a la Wikipedia. Google Places and Maps are not public resource entries, theyre marketing tools. In the wrong hands, they can demolish a brands reputation and grind foot traffic to a halt. But Google isnt the only technology company small businesses point the finger at. Yelp, too, has been blamed for , and some have allegedly in more than one company closing its doors. Its unlikely Google, Yelp, or any other major brand will take responsibility here, so the onus is on us. (Get it? Thats a pun!) Keep an eye on your Google Maps and Google Places profiles, as well as your online reviews, and make sure nothing looks wonky. Even something as small as your hours or location on a map can be altered  so pay attention to the details.","From Google Analytics to social media dashboards, too much datacan lead to metricsoverload. How can you tell if your customers are happy with your service? How do you know whether your inbound marketing strategy is working? How do you know if your social media marketing is building strong brand awareness or getting lost in theTwittersphere? Theres a good reason that, for marketers, reporting and proving their digital marketing ROI is their biggest challenge, HubSpot.More marketing channels mean more metrics, but not necessarily better campaigns or even a clear idea of what constitutes a successful campaign. In fact, in a report sure to scare allCMOs,TrackMavenrecently said that marketers are generating more content but . Is your marketing department drowning in metrics overload without being able to see any real meaning? Bettermeasurement is smarter measurement: its that simple. It all boils down to choosing the right metrics so you can fully value and understand your customers journey from awareness to purchase to retention. Heres where most businesses take a misstep: rather than looking at the entire customer journey, they focus on a singletouchpoint. customer journeyfrom brand awareness to online leads to in-store sales to increased profits. When picking key performance indicators (KPIs), select metrics from each step in the journey. For example, rather than drawing a direct correlation between display ads and product purchases, take into account other signals customers are receiving, like email marketing, social media, and even the placement of your key terms in organic search. These metrics as a whole will inform the success of your campaign. Lets say you launched a new social media campaign last week, and youre already sure its a success. After all, you got over 1,000 views on your first viral video in less than a week, way above your usual performance rates of 250. But how do you know if 1,000 viewsare agood amount? You need to benchmark this campaign against other campaigns in your industry, not just your companys past performance. Maybe your top competitors only get 500 views, so youve already landed double that in less time. Or perhaps the competition regularly land 10,000 views; by that comparison, 1,000 is a clear miss. Finally, dont be distracted by views alone; look at the overall audience. If the majority of the views are coming from current subscribers, but the campaigns mission is to reach new customers, then its missed the mark. If your marketing goal is to generate leads, it naturally follows that youll want to keep the cost per acquisition down, right? Not necessarily. As any successful sales team knows, getting handed a deck of 1,000low-qualityleads is a huge waste of time. It would be much more effective to get 100high-qualityleads. Consequently, superficial metrics like number of leads generated or cost per acquisition are misleading. A low CPA doesnt tell you much. In fact, lowering your CPA might mean youve inadvertently lowered lead quality across the board, spiking sales costs since your team is now wasting energy and time on leads that arent qualified. In this example, a better metric would be cost per qualified acquisition. Checking five different dashboards to keep an eye on campaign metrics can give you whiplash as you hop from Google Analytics to Buffer to Sprout Social and back again. If youre drowning in dashboards, consider consolidating everything to a single service, likeCyfe. Stop wasting countless hours tracking every piece of data across multiple dashboards and head to one central location. Plus, with a single set of dashboards, youre less likely to miss a key piece of information. When it comes to avoiding metrics overload and understanding your marketing data, take a holistic approach. Thanks to natural company divisions, it can be second nature to fall into asiloedapproach that focuses on a single customer behavior ortouchpoint, rather than the entire process. With a centralized dashboard, you can bring your data andreportingtogether for your entire business.","There has been a great deal of activity in the CRM (customer relationship management) industry of late when it comes to marketing automation. Just over the past couple months Salesfoce.com bought Exact Target (who had not long before acquired Pardot), Marketo had a very successful IPO and Adobe announced their intent to purchase Neolane. But most of these moves had the big enterprise in mind, so what does this mean to small businesses and their marketing automation needs? Raghu Raghavan, CEO of marketing automation platform provider Act-On, joins Brent Leary for a discussion on what the impact of these moves means, if anything, to small businesses. He shares his take on how the proliferation of channels is impacting marketing for small businesses and how marketing automation can help improve their likelihood for marketing success at a time of rapid change. * * * * * My interest in this whole space probably started some 12 to 13 years ago. I was one of the two founders of Responsys, which back then was one of first SaaS companies before the word SaaS was even being used. We built a very nice, multitalented platform for doing email marketing back in the day. One of the things that struck me all along was that email was always going to become a part of a much bigger picture with respect to marketers. When I started Act-On, there was a lot of interest in a more robust view of marketing. I think Eloqua for ten years had been talking about marketing automation and what it would mean. I think they educated the market. When Marketo came into the market they basically challenged a lot of the assumptions. Marketing automation always was along the lines of SAP meets marketing. It was like a big ERP implementation, nine months to set up, and Marketo came in and challenged that. They came with a fantastic approach to the market and we wanted to do some of those things. When we started Act-On, Salesforce was dominant. We were working on our platform to be used everywhere. Marketing automation was starting to be talked about more widely, so it was a fantastic time to enter into a new market that was barely penetrated. Act-On is a company that has the founding engineering from Responsys, it has a lot of deep knowledge about SaaS. We came in, we saw the all of the things that had not been done right in this space, and I think it allowed us to build a company in an whole new way to attack what we saw in the monsters market. I think in a huge way. That is a great question. Because I think that is one of the driving factors for marketing automation that no one really talks much about. You know a little bit of history, it helps to be around this space for a long time. If you look at companies like Unica, part of the new Enterprise Marketing Management (EMM) group at IBM, and Aprimo, old line companies  I shouldnt say old line, they are not that old, but they are now old line companies. They actually set out to solve a problem that big companies had, which was multiple channels. For big companies the channels were email, the Web, dealer networks  it was all of their other physical touch points, re-sellers and what-have-you. Well if you look at companies now, if you look at all of these channels it is sort of like that. So the technology for multi-channel behavior management had been done in a different domain. What happens now is that there is a need to engineer all of this down to a format where a small company, with a relatively small number of employees in marketing can actually make sense of all of this. Every company we talk to tries everything. They try to tweet; they create a Facebook Page; they blog; they do things on the website. The interesting thing with marketing now is to say, What should I be doing? Am I doing enough, because there is no universal answer of what is the best thing for anybody? Marketing automation has come along and created a forum where there is a lot of things you can do pretty quickly, lots of power tools. So now the real question is, How do you use them wisely? The great thing about marketing automation is it takes the focus away from the individual tools and shifts the focus towards what the market is trying to achieve. Yess. I think that you raised the question of affordability. It is interesting because the two companies that basically challenge the status quo on that were Pardot and us. Pardot and Act-On basically went and said, Look, you can do sophisticated things without spending a lot of money. What is starting to happen here in terms of visiting the mainstream, is you know historically, if you look at Eloqua and if you looked at Marketo, guys who have been in this market for a while, the bulk of their customers were high tech companies, and high tech companies tend to be early adopters of technology. But in 2012 and certainly in 2013, this technology is widely adopted. We have customers in every imaginable industry, segment and nook that you can imagine. We have a customer that sells hazardous material, disposal equipment, gloves and drums and radioactive suits and what-have-you. Now, you tend to not think of these as companies that traditionally adopt this technology. But with the advent of all of these channels, people used their Facebook at home, and started to see ways in which they could use Facebook for work. Or the way people tweet and how they can use this for work. This technology has become completely consumerized. It is no longer in the domain of high tech users. It is consumerized in consumers. I probably have a contrarian view to this and might even be controversial. What is happening here is the evolution of biology of companies that have run the gamut of what they can do, basically getting bought. I mean ExactTarget technology is not pushing the limit of anything, this is a done deal. It is old stuff. Salesforce buying them clears the field for newer companies to come in and do newer and more exciting things. The thing that becomes interesting is people read the stuff in the press and they become even more desirous of trying these things. If they search market automation they will find lots of dynamic companies that have stuff they can use right away. Yes definitely, we are seeing an uptake in interest. Certainly, the companies that want to acquire these technologies already are interested in all of the companies in this space. People like Marketo, Hubspot and us are all the topic of conversation. But every day business has less to do with this and more to do to with the fact that there are lots of companies out there that need this stuff, dont have the stuff and dont read the trade press. This 5% number that I quoted is actually very true. If you look at the companies that are ready for marketing automation in North America alone, the penetration is minuscule. In every state of engagement with a customer, our technology is relevant. It is engaging with customers that you dont know yet; anonymous visitors to your website. Just because they are anonymous doesnt mean you cant start to track their behavior and give them interesting stuff to look at. The application of marketing to help sales reps close the business faster, or the application of marketing to take an existing customer and grow them, and upsell them. The ability to use marketing to have your reference customers take action on your behalf by awarding them  this entire gamut of customer engagements is where we expect to be. Come to our website, .","The IRS this week announced the adoption of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. According to the IRS, the document is intended to provide American taxpayers with a better understanding of their rights. The document is called Publication 1,Your Rights as a Taxpayer. It will be sent to millions of taxpayers when they receive IRS notices on issues ranging from audits to collection. The IRS says the Taxpayer Bill of Rights document will also be publicly visible in all IRS facilities on posters the IRS is having printed up. The document consists of 10 rights. While the document is new, the10 rights are not new. They are existing rights already in the tax code. The IRS has grouped them into 10 categories and made them easier to find and easier to read. And it all fits on just onepage. Considering that the , its a public service just to summarize the rights down toa single page. These are core concepts about which taxpayers should be aware. The new Taxpayer Bill of Rights summarizes these important protections in a clearer, more understandable format than ever before, said IRS Commissioner John A. Koskinen in a prepared statement. Similar to the U.S. Constitutions Bill of Rights, the IRS Taxpayer Bill of Rights contains 10 provisions: IRS Publication 1, containing the Bill of Rights, initially isavailable in English and Spanish. Later it will be available in Chinese, Korean, Russian and Vietnamese. The IRS has also created a . At the moment its a barebones section, listing what the document contains, but the IRS says it will add to and update that section of the website. Obviously, asingle-pagedocument cant begin to answer every question about your rights. Consider it a plain-language outline of your taxpayerrights. The Bill of Rights was championed by the National Taxpayer Advocate Nina E. Olson. It was listed as the Taxpayer Advocate Services top priority in a recent report to Congress. Congress has passed multiple pieces of legislation with the title of Taxpayer Bill of Rights, Olson said. However, taxpayer surveys conducted by my office have found that most taxpayers do not believe they have rights before the IRS and even fewer can name their rights. I believe the list of core taxpayer rights the IRS is announcing today will help taxpayers better understand their rights in dealing with the tax system. The IRSs moveis a step in a positive direction because it communicates in a way that issimple and easy to understand (unlike the tax code itself). Plus, it tells people information they may not know. For example, some smallbusiness ownersmay not even know that the exists and that it may be able to help if your business is facing an immediate adverse action. Making people awarein plain language has value. Also, its positive in the sense of communicating toIRS employees. IRS Commissioner Koskinen emphasized that the Taxpayer Bill of Rights will serve as a clear reminder that all of the IRS takes seriously our responsibility to treat taxpayers fairly. While the Taxpayer Bill of Rights wont address anypast abusesthat may exist, nor stamp out all abuses, its meaningful. What organizations choose tocommunicate (or not) toemployees matters. It sets the tone. It reinforces culture. In avacuum ofcommunication, employees can and do reach different conclusions. The full text of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights is embedded in the Slideshare below:","Vine has expanded beyond looping videos. Vine has introduced a new service where you send video messages directly to your friends. The addition of private messaging comes with the ability to send short video clips to any contact on your mobile device  not just other Vine members. Of course, non-Vine recipients of these messages will be limited to send you text responses back. Vine Product Manager Jason Toff says in a company post that this feature was something some users were already doing: Vine messages can be sent to multiple users at once. However, all responses to group messages are recorded in individual conversations in your Vine inbox. You will also have the ability to block messages sent by users you dont know. To create a video message, you need only select the feature from the navigation menu on the Vine app. Theres one tap required to start recording a message, and another tap to stop. Recipients are selected from contacts stored either through Vine or the address book on the mobile device youre using. Originally, Vine was just a way of sharing very short videos with your followers, similar to the way social media platforms let you share updates with your network. Some small businesses began to take advantage of the  quick, 6-second looping videos you can embed almost anywhere  and created marketing campaigns using Vine. The direct messaging addition presents some potential new opportunities for businesses using Vine. First, the group messaging function will allow you to send short messages to your co-workers. If youre looking for everyones reaction to something, a video reply could give you more than just an emotionless text. Second, if your business does have a Vine account already, you could try sending messages to individual contacts. Depending on the privacy settings your recipients choose for Vine messages, however, could determine whether they ever see your messages. TechCrunchs Matthew Panzarino businesses could take advantage of direct messages Advertising, though, it could take time:","Spend any real time in the small business marketing world and youll quickly be inundated with new services, new tools, new updates, new features and new things everyone thinks you should be aware of. As a result, its not always easy to decide what truly demands your attention and what can be written off as background noise. For that reason its possible that when Google Place Pages was first released a few months ago, you ignored it. And if thats the case, its time to reconsider your position. Last week I had the privilege of attending in California and one hot topic on the tip of everyones tongue was the importance of Google Place Pages and their effect on SMBs.  Why should you worry about Google Place Pages?  Below are four good reasons. : While at SMX West last week, Gregg Stewart of noted that 20 percent of all searches on Google now have a local intent, and that number is even higher when you look at searches performed on mobile devices.  SEO expert Bruce Clay later predicted that in two years (!).  Thats pretty significant and offers a good indication of where things are going.  Searchers are headed online to find local businesses and, thanks to personalization, Google is showing local results even when a user doesnt specifically ask for them. Users are looking for your business online and one of the best ways to help them find you is to claim, optimize and . By ignoring it, you make it harder for customers to do business with you. Why do that? :   One reason some small business owners arent too friendly to Place Pages is that they resent Google decentralizing their information and pulling people from their core site. Unfortunately, thats exactly why users these aggregate pages. They like being able to check out one page and see all your vital information. Embrace it and give users what theyre looking for. Because, at the end of the day, it doesnt matter how a user finds your address and phone numberjust that they do and that youve excited them enough to use it. : Thanks to some Google algorithm changes, Place Pages have been given significant search prominence. That means whether you like them or not, theyre showing up, and potential customers are stumbling upon them.  As a savvy business owner, you must do your part and help those searchers find you by completely filling out your Google Place Page. I know its a little monotonous to always be filling out those little boxes all over the Web, but youre being asked for a reason  Google is using that information to rank you.  Fill out everything, be careful when selecting your business category, and include as much information and (keyword-rich) details as you can.  The more complete (and keyword-rich) your profile, the better. : You know the information being posted about you all over the Web? Much of it is being aggregated and displayed in your Google Place page. That means whats out there about you for your business  all the reviews, the associated images, the business information, etc.  is getting more attention than ever before. If you dont know whats out there about your brand, Google Place Pages provides more incentive for you to find out.  Take this time to make sure its all accurate and consistent. Above are just a few reasons why Google Place Pages are becoming synonymous with local search engine optimization. If you havent invested serious time in claiming your Google Place Page listing and optimizing it, run (dont walk) to go do that right now.  This is not an area that you can put on the back burner until you have time to tackle it. Google is serious about local search, and your Place Page just may be the glue that brings it all together.","You have to love business authors who look for a new twist on ideas, especially when they encapsulate that twist in a book title.Chuck Blakeman ( ) succeeds with a Big E for that encapsulate. Want proof? Just check out Blakemans in-depth book, . The title was the reason the book caught my attention via Twitter. I like books that find ways to ignite our imaginations, and Blakeman certainly makes a solid attempt in envisioning fulfilling work. Blakeman wrote the book , and is CEO of the Crankset Group. The books title is the third of 7 core business diseases  archaic practices that are a cumulative result from societys overemphasis on technology. Employees are thus silent in their workplaces. They bring their productivity but creative thinking skills are limited (BTW, there is a chapter on why managers are a bad idea, too.) This message may sound like a new-age rant on the surface, but Blakemans approach helps the reader think critically about what workplace they want to be in. It can also inspire small business owners to be mindful on what culture they want to establish, as small companies now have a capacity to operate like a corporation in many ways. Blakeman advocates how the Factory System in the Industrial Age replaced craft in small spaces, along with a perception of what meaningful work was suppose to be: Blakeman juxtaposes historical perspective and an entrepreneurial experience in Africa with many of the themes played out in todays world. Its about the quest to build value in how we work. In the following quote, for example, Blakeman notes the irony of what large corporations have done. Not so much a criticism on big business as much as how we have adjusted our life expectations as a result: All of this contributed to the diseases that are symptomatic of the Industrial Age and require reframing business principles as needed. Youll read about the 21stcentury Industrialist, for example, which gave rise to the rugged individualist, or the idea of being big (just to be big). The qualities that worked well may not be a best fit for being engaged with the work expected. Blakeman is not saying not to hire employees. Hes saying that you need to treat employees differently today. He advocates that we are in a Participation Age, a period in which workers must be fully engaged to provide valuable results. The Participation Age contrasts todays best practices by reframing employees as stakeholders who take initiatives and carry responsibility for their critical thinking, benefiting their peers and organization as a result: Businesses highlighted in the book are from traditional industries. This makes the book a useful journal for managers who do not view their business as a tech business but need to assess how to best leverage applications that have a presence on operations, such as software-as-a-service tools. Its an interesting contrast to ideas advanced by tech-centric entrepreneurs like Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, authors of   Fried and Hansson present ideas expected from tech entrepreneurship. Blakemans points about meaningful work compares, but with an added emphasis on reimagining responsibilities, even if roles seemed better kept at status quo. The solution to the woes of the industrial age is seeking meaning in our work. This message alone is not new, but Blakeman innovates by connecting the message to the historical industrial perspective. For example, the Industrial Age was meant to support Safety, Security and Stability. Those three have built a foundation for a new S  Significance. To drive home his point about how disruptive this concept is, Blakeman notes how Millennial professionals have come to value it: Among the solutions advocated is a unique perspective on balance  the illusion of it being an attainable goal worth pursuing: You may want to also take a few minutes to read the afterword, How Capitalism Will Solve Poverty and a global view of where engagement can take us. All in all, read this book to gain a new perspective on where your business fits in an increasingly technological world. Moreover, read it to learn how to best unleash your company culture into a productive one that will continually attract employees  employees who are engaged and treated the way the 21st century employee expects to be treated.","Selling is inherently social. Keeping administrative track of your customers and prospects is not. Compiling all the different ways you talk with and engage with customers should be as easy as managing email. Nimble as a CRM and social media management tool is one way to solve this problem and have a social inbox. Nimble is making it easy for business owners to keep track of relationship activity without the normal customer relationship management challenges of doing so. Many busy executives live in their email inbox. Thats where Nimble is allowing you to manage relationships and tasks and maintain a listening and engagement outpost. You make it free for individuals. You help people reduce the administrative burden in their lives. Nimble has done this well. There is a fair amount of noise in the social CRM space, but the key differences with Nimble are: Jon Ferrara is the founder of well-known, market-leading contact management software Goldmine. His approach to business will help Nimble differentiate itself. The biggest point of differentiation is selling through resellers. Most Web-based companies are all about direct-to- customer strategies (and for good reason), but Nimble believes a value-added reseller channel will open up more doors, faster. Ferrara did it with Goldmine and was very successful. When Im in my own contact record and not someone elses, I can see my entire contact list in a social stream format. More precisely, like you see each stream of Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn when you are in those services, you can see all of them in one view in Nimble. You see the updates with the relevant icon next to the status update. It lets you respond in those services, too. Its easy to retweet someones stuff from within Nimble; the same goes for Facebook and LinkedIn. Nimble also showed me a summary of terms or hashtags that were popular or common in my own stream. The names are grayed out, but the yellow box below shows the familiar t of Twitter or F of Facebook or in of LinkedIn. When I say social inbox I am not talking about it as Facebook does  as they did when they introduced their new messaging platform. No, I mean an inbox that pulls together all the different ways and places you interact with a customer. Ultimately, I believe thats what most busy business owners want  all their information in one place so they can keep the customer conversation going. If you are running a VOIP phone solution like Skype or Google Voice or Vonage, you can also have this customer communication in the inbox. Nimble is an amazing product. Not because its free, although thats pretty cool, but because it lets me engage with a customer or prospect in a way that truly makes sense. I see all of my communication with you, as an individual, but I can also see all of your social stream and how you are interacting with others. This is transparency at a whole new level because it is more convenient  I dont have to pop in and out of those different services to keep up with you. I can do it from my Nimble inbox.

While you may have had several questions leading up to the decision to form an LLC, you probably have even more on what to do after. Is creating an LLC enough to let you legally open your doors for business? Not exactly. Here are 10 things to consider before youre ready to do business. Many new business owners think that forming an LLC or corporation is the same as getting a business license. Then unfortunately, some realize this isnt the case when they are fined for operating without a license. Think of it this way: getting an LLC is the first step and creates a legal foundation for the business. A business license gives you the right to operate. Depending on what kind of business you have and where you live, you may need to get business licenses from your state, county, or town. Examples include: zoning permit, permit from the health department, professional licenses, a general business operation license, and home occupation permits. Most licenses are relatively inexpensive and getting one upfront will save you money and keep your business legit. Check with your local board of equalization offices, or find a service to determine which permits your business needs to legally operate. Many states require what is called a sellers permit (or a similar name). This permit is required for sole proprietors, LLCs, partnerships, and corporations that sell taxable goods and services. For example, in California, a sellers permit must be obtained by any business that sells or leases property thats subject to the states retail sales tax. Make sure you get this permit before you start selling. An EIN, also known as a federal tax ID number, is a way for the IRS to identify your business and track its transactions. Think of an EIN like a social security number for companies. If you plan on having employees, an EIN is mandatory. However, getting an EIN is good practice even without employees. Thats because you can give the EIN, instead of your personal social security number to clients and vendors. An LLC has pass-through tax treatment, meaning that the business profits and losses are passed along and reported on the business owners tax return. As the owner of an LLC, you must report all profits (or losses) of the business on a Schedule C with your personal tax return. LLC owners who are active in the business must also pay self-employment tax on the profits. In some cases, it may benefit you to elect S Corporation status. This enables you to split your business profits into salary and distributions. Youll pay self-employment tax (or Medicare/social security tax) on the salary portion, but not on the distributions. To elect S Corporation status, you need to file form 2553 with the IRS (its free) within 75 days since forming the LLC, or 75 days from the start of the current tax year. Once you have established your LLC, you can open a business bank account under the LLC. This will allow you to accept checks made out to your business name. In addition, owners of corporations and LLCs are legally obligated to keep their personal and business finances separate  so having a dedicated business bank account is a must. In addition to opening a separate bank account, using a business credit card is a smart idea. By putting all your business expenses on the business card, youve got an instant audit trail of your years expenses when tax time rolls around. In addition, having a business-specific credit card will help you maintain your corporate veilthats what protects your personal assets. While forming an LLC or incorporating does help protect your personal assets from any liability of the company, it doesnt protect the business itself from losses. Thats why you should consider getting a general liability insurance or a Business Owners Policy (BOP). These policies will broadly cover your business against accidents, injuries, and negligence claims. In addition, if youre selling a product, youll need product liability insurance. And, if you provide a professional service (i.e. lawyers, accountants, notaries, real estate agents, insurance agents, hair salons, consultants), youll need to take out a professional liability policy. If your LLC will be doing business in a state other than the state where you formed the LLC, you will need to register in the new state(s). Examples of doing business can include: Opening an office or store in another state, when a significant portion of your companys revenue comes from another state; when you have employees working in another state; and when you frequently conduct in-person meetings in a state. If like most businesses you are going to be operating under any variation of your official company name (i.e. Company vs. Company.com vs. Company, Inc), you will need to file a for each of the variations. You should have your LLC file the DBAs so they operate underneath the LLC. Once you become a corporation or LLC, youve got to operate your business at a higher administrative level than youve been used to as a sole proprietor. Both LLCs and corporations often need to file an annual report with their state, as well as keep up with their quarterly tax payments. Mark these important dates on a calendar ahead of time, or sign up for a service that will automatically send you alerts ahead of key state and federal filing deadlines.","A new headset aims to make you a better listener  with a clearer voice, too.Tech startup ONvocal used the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to . But calling this device a headset really is a mistake. Apart from a pair of ear buds, one of which has a small, rigid microphone stick, just a wire from each is looped through a bracket attached to a unique neckband. The idea behind the Mix360 is to provide a Hi-Fi audio experience through your smartphone or other connected device. ONvocal makes no bones about the premium quality on the Mix360 or about its premium price. Its currently available for pre-order until the end of January for $299. After that, it will sell for $349. Mix360 should be by May. In promising to improve how you hear whats coming from your smartphone and how people hear you, ONvocal says it spared no expense and built the Mix360 headset with a limitless budget. On the official ONvocal blog, Katie Hawkes, head of brand and communications development : According to its product descriptions, the unique and definitely different neckband on the Mix360 is used to control media, through Play/Pause and volume control buttons, and a stereo jack on one side. The other side of the neckband has a power button, several function buttons, and a USB port. The neckband has two flex zones which are made of brass and covered in a comfort-inspired material. These are designed to be manipulated so they mold to your necks contours to stay in place. Once you get past the idea of a neckband, ONvocal hopes youll focus on the audio experience. By using some high-end technology and a connected mobile app, Mix360 allows users to actually mix what they hear through their earbuds. So instead of the streaming music on your smartphone going silent when you get a call or notification, the mixer app allows you to select the levels at which you hear or are heard. If you need to turn up the mic to place or receive a call, the app allows you to adjust the volume of the call and your media accordingly. That goes for the ambient or background noise, too. Street noises can be filtered in or out, based on your circumstance. Mix360 uses top audio drivers to deliver a Hi-Fi sound into the pair of earbuds. The headset connects to your smartphone using a Bluetooth connection. And in doing so, its also stocked with Bluetooth firmware that works with a smartphones voice command features. The device promises to deliver your voice clearly to your audience on the other line. According to a product description, Mix360 uses Beam-Forming Microphone Array (BFMA or Buff Ma), and a mini-boom mic stick. These mics are designed to focus on only your voice and not any background noise.","I tightened up my Twitter follow list yesterday. I like to do that every month to filter out the voices Ive stopped listening to and to hopefully add in some new ones.  The whole process made me curious as to why Twitter users may decide to unfollow someone.  So, I thought Id ask. And the results of my quick Twitter poll were so interesting I thought Id share them. Basically, people will unfollow you for anything.  Here were some of the reasons mentioned by my Twitter followers: Lots of people mentioned that they were turned off by Twitter users who do nothing but promote their own content. While lots of us have businesses and blogs were trying to get the word out about, its important that you also take time to listen and support what everyone else is doing.  You dont want to be the guy that puts the me in social media. Twitter users like mentioned that too much bickering or negativity was another reason theyll unfollow someone.  No one wants to surround themselves with someone who never runs out of axes to grind. Too much angry tweeting and we unfollow you hoping youll go outside and calm down. For folks like and , too much self-centered tweeting about what youre doing today, what youre wearing, or how awesome you are is also grounds for an unfollow.  Again, people like it when youre more interested in them than yourself. Even if you have to fake it. This should go without saying but blatant racist, sexist, homophobic or other offensive comments are a great way to get yourself unfollowed. Both and agreed on that. Too much tweeting about how drunk you got last night, whom you were with or how much you hate your coworkers tends to make everyone a little uncomfortable. And then they unfollow you so they dont have to feel uncomfortable anymore. Both and commented that flood Twitters typically earn themselves an unfollow. A flood tweeter is someone who will rapidly tweet back to back so that all you see is a flood of their avatar. It looks like this. [Thanks for the screenshot.] If youre upbeat all the time, prepare to be unfollowed. Folks like , and and all commented that if youre never angry, its a clear sign that youre not a real person.  They want to see some balance. In order to love something, you have to at least not like someone else. Give people both sides. : Nothing hurts more than choosing to follow someone you think is cooland then being hit with the dread auto spam DM. Ouch. With 140 characters its hard enough to have a conversation about what youre eating. Lets agree to save the conversations for how to fix the world for times were face to face. On Twitter, they typically just devolve into angry name-calling. Folks like and commented that one reason theyll unfollow is if the person isnt sharing anything new. Typically that means incessant retweets of what Mashable and all the other A-listers are putting out there. We know theyre smart, but what are YOU bringing to the table? Twitter users like said they unfollow if the account feels too automated. No one wants to follow a robot. A robot. A robot. Sorry :  Twitter users like and commented that if theres not enough conversation happening or someone consistently doesnt reply back to your messages, theyll unfollow you.  Makes sense considering so many turn to Twitter looking for conversations and real relationships. If you want friends, you have to be a friend first. Enough said. For that number was more than 25 tweets a day, but everyone will have their own comfort levels.  I probably tweet 25 times before lunch.  I didnt know this could be a probably but and both commented that if you dont tweet ENOUGH, they may also unfollow you. even provided a tool called which will weed out those who dont tweet often enough. Okay, so maybe just made me laugh with this one. But its true! You tell people how many followers you can get them overnight (thanks @jakelacaze) or you send me tweets that look like this: This was a big one with people like .  If youre not showing your personality and giving people a taste of who you are, then theyre bound to go elsewhere.  Its called media for a reason. This was noted by @dj_justjay, and as a big reason for unfollowing. If youre all links and no talk, youre not providing much value to your Twitter stream. And people arent going to stick around for very long. Believe it or not but some people are still mad over Twitters new Retweet feature and will actually unfollow you for using it.  Both and are believers of this commandment. I was pretty amazed by all the reasons people gave for unfollowing someone. Personally, I dont think theres a right or wrong way to Twitter or make friends on the Web. However, it is important to know what kind of tweets your particular audience finds useful so that you can help increasing your value on their eyes.   I know I break at least half of these donts on a daily basis, but it works for me.  You have to find what works for you. Consider asking your followers why they followed you in the first place.

On Thursday, Feb. 4, the Fed's system sent $20 million (15.1 million) to Sri Lanka and $81 million to the Philippines. The Sri Lankan transaction contained a small but crucial error: The money was being sent to a bank account in the name of a nonprofit foundation, but the electronic message spelled it ""fundation."" That prompted Deutsche Bank, an intermediary in the transaction, and a Sri Lankan bank to contact Bangladesh Bank, which led to the payment being cancelled and the money returned. That Thursday, over the space of a few minutes, the New York Fed also cleared four transactions to accounts with Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) in the Philippines - for $6 million, $30 million, $20 million and $25 million. Each account was in the name of an individual, according to RCBC lawyer Maria Cecilla Estavillo, who testified at a Philippine Senate committee examining the heist. All the names were false. The accounts were at a branch of RCBC in Jupiter Street, on the edge of Manila's business district. According to testimony by Estavillo and bank officials, $22.7 million was withdrawn from one of the RCBC accounts during the afternoon of Friday, Feb 5. But the rest of the money stayed in RCBC.  Over that weekend Bangladesh Bank was struggling to understand what had happened and to cancel the hackers' fraudulent payment requests; meanwhile, the Fed had raised concerns over some of the requests but did little more. Late on Monday, according to Bangladesh Bank sources and the Philippine senate testimony, Bangladesh Bank sent messages via the SWIFT bank messaging system to RCBC asking it to freeze the money that had arrived in the four individuals' accounts. It was a holiday in the Philippines for Chinese New Year celebrations. The following morning nearly $58 million was moved out of those accounts. That evening, RCBC told Bangladesh Bank that it had frozen the four suspect accounts  but that only $68,305 was left in them.  RCBC officials told the Senate committee that the SWIFT messages from Bangladesh Bank had been wrongly formatted and were not marked as urgent, so they had gone into a large pile of unread messages for almost the whole day. Staff had only got to them in the evening, RCBC said. Under Philippine banking laws, the stolen funds could not be frozen until a criminal case was lodged, even though they were still in the banking system. And over the next few days, most of the $81 million disappeared into the country's casino industry, which is exempted from anti-money laundering laws. Though $18 million was recovered, otherwise the trail went cold.  At the Senate hearing, bank officials pinned the blame for the disappearance of the money on the manager of the Jupiter Street branch, accusing her of allowing accounts to be opened under false names. The manager, who was sacked in March, said she had acted on instructions from senior officials and was being made a scapegoat. RCBC and the branch manager declined to comment. Last month, in an annual report given to shareholders, RCBC said it had begun instituting reforms to prevent such events from happening again.

Look at you, optimizingopportunities in cloud computing and capitalizing on your own big data to make more strategic decisions. Today, businesses of all sizes are realizing the benefits of cloud technology and how it improves theefficiency, productivity and functionality of business operations.The reality is, the percentage of U.S. small businessesusing cloud computing is expected to more than double during the next six years,according to a study from consulting firm Emergent Research. Taking a look at small businesses and the cloud, theEmergent Research study revealed 78 percentof small businesses (companies with less than 50 employees) will be fully adapted to the cloud by 2020  up from 37 percent in 2014. Though todays small businesses are reporting using cloud-based applications chiefly foremail, online banking and social media, the expansion of the small business communitys utilization of diverse cloud applications, tools and platformsis anticipated to greatly increase.As this trendgrows, Emergent Research forecaststhat cloud computing will completely change how small businesses operate by 2020  as the small business landscape fully adapts to cloud computing. With variable instead of fixed costs, its cheaper for small businesses to leverage the cloud. The cloud provides a flexible and scalable platform that greatly enhances a small companys opportunities to manage, share and control its data. Below are ways the cloud is reshapingsmall business productivity today  and why cloud computing may be the coolestthing to happen to small business since the filing cabinet. The cloud gives todays small businesses an affordable, expansive platform to store data securely. For many small businesses, the cloud adds a security that is unmatched, resulting in data back-up, decreased hacking vulnerability and protection from the latest cyber-security woes. The cloud gives small businesses a security infrastructure that streamlines operations while keeping data safe, allowing small businesses to operate safely 24/7. When a business runs with powerful collaboration, everything from daily operations to exceptional customer service is managed and controlled. Collaboration lets a small business operate like a Fortune 500 firm, keeping clients informed, team members on task and mobile workers functional and effective throughout the business day. The cloud delivers this degree of collaborative functionality to small businesses. With cloud computing in place, an enterprise can track, manage and schedule tasks 24/7, expanding business productivity and customer care greatly. With cloud computing, small businesses can not only collaborate better  they can control their data better in the process. Since cloud computing keeps all data in one central location, all team members can access the data and documents required to stay efficient and on task throughout the business day  and beyond. Employees and managers can analyze projects and tasks with ease to determine more streamlined ways of doing business. Since files are no longer trapped on one team members computer, business productivity can rise to new levels as professionals and teams can work on projects 24/7 whether in the office or at home on their tablets or smartphones. When a small business relies on a cloud-based service to store and manage its data, the days of complex disaster recovery headaches are over. Cloud computing adds security for small businesses, negating disasters caused by hacking and cyber threats. In the event of a natural disaster, having data in the cloud means you dont have to worry about power requirements, space considerations or physical barriers  your data is safe, stored and accessible from any mobile device. By migrating to the cloud, small businesses position their data to survive a disaster.","Fifty years ago, a boy was born to a family of traditional musician-storytellers in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China. In 1972, when US President Richard Nixon visited China, this boy was merely eight years old. But little did anyone know that this visit will sow the seed in the mind of this eight-year-old to dream big. The US Presidents visit left the boy with a desire to learn English and he started to guide foreign tourists in his hometown in exchange for learning English from them. One of the tourists gave him the name Jack. The name stuck, and Jack went on to become a celebrity in China by creating the largest e-commerce company of the world. But more importantly, his success taught the ordinary people to dream of doing extraordinary things. Jack Ma proved that in a Communist society, an entrepreneur can succeed. Hes inspiring, visionary and unique. Be it the mass wedding, which he organizes for his employees, or the transparency about his plans, Jacks inimitable approach to things make him stand out. His humility to accept mistakes and learn from others is a big lesson to all aspiring entrepreneurs in the world. Jack wants to write two books about his experiences of two decades in Internet and e-commerce, one Alibaba 1001 Mistakes and the other How to make your company smaller. This speaks a lot about the modesty of the richest man of China whose personal wealth amounts to a whopping (approx) $24 B. revisited Jacks interactions over the last few years to bring out the 33 pearls of wisdom which can teach you more about life and business than many books combined together.","Last week at SmallBizTrends I shared the statistic that because they didnt feel it was important to their business. That post spurred a lot of strong comments, both on site here and on Facebook. Eventually the conversation went from whether SMBs should invest in social media to whether they even need a Website or an Internet presence at all. I really wish we could stop having this conversation. You probably know some businesses who are doing phenomenally well without a website. I do, too. But I often wonder how much they could be doing if they took the time to invest in one. And when I say website, I dont mean an electronic version of that brochure theyve been handing out for the past 10 years. I mean a legitimate, well-thought-out site that is designed to inform, engage and convert their audience. Here are just a few benefits that come along with creating a usable website for your small business. Let me know why you think it is (or isnt) important for a SMB to have a website in 2011. Im not trying to be flippant, but by creating a website you stop being invisible to the people trying to find you online. More and more studies are telling us about the ROBO effect where customers are learning to research online before buying offline. Theyre typing their problems or needs into the search engine of their choice and are researching the companies that appear for those queries. If you dont have a Web presence, theres no chance of you showing up and you never even enter into their thought process. In 2011, you cant afford to be invisible. While you cant simply rattle off a list of search terms you want to be found for, you can use search engine optimization basics to help control where your site shows up and for which queries. By creating optimized content, building relevant links and creating a brand that customers want to engage with, you set yourself up as an authority in the eyes of the search engine and increase your chances of appearing for the right queries  the ones paying customers are using to find businesses just like yours. Creating an optimized website helps you to gain important visibility for the right terms. A website is a powerful sales tool and one that allows you to address your customers concerns, give them the information they need to make a decision and create compelling calls to action. Sure, you can keep placing ads in the Yellow Pages and hope that word-of-mouth generates on its ownor you can build something that inspires it to happen. Your website is your home turf where people can go to seek out trusted information about your company and engage with you on a more personal level. Use it to build confidence in your brand and to give customers important buying information (and incentives). Though the Web has been around for some time, its true that you didnt always need a website to find your audience. It was a lot easier to market via direct mailings, Yellow page ads and local word-of-mouth. However, today your website and your social presence are the factors that customers are looking for when they research a small business. They want to know that youre stable enough to have a dedicated Web presence. That youll be around tomorrow should something go wrong. That they can get ahold of you when they need to. By creating a website, you set up shop on the Internet and show customers that this is where they can come to find information about you, to read articles that youve written and to learn more about your company. All of these things build authority. Without a website, youre at a huge disadvantage as a small business owner trying to speak to your customers. Even if you hate the Web, you probably still like email. I bet you even collect emails from your customers by hand so that you can keep them up to date on whats happening in-store. Having a website allows you to do all of that better because it makes it easier, faster and provides even more incentive for someone to sign up. Create a site that users can trust and then use it to build your email list. Along with your website, that list just may end up being one of your strongest sales tools. Those are just five important reason for a small business owner to create a Web presence. Why do you have one? Or why you have one?","The free, open-source crowdfunding site was last week.

The new Apple iPad Air, the fifth generation of the iPad, isnt noticeably different in specs, one reviewer says. Though Apple says a new company designed A7 processing chip makes this a more powerful device than its predecessor, the iPad 4. Instead, its the compact design  just 7.5 millimeters thick and weighing only a pound  that gets much of the notice. Apple is focusing on this customer experience idea too.

Small business owners who do business online are divided on the measure. According to CNNMoney.com, the to pass their version of the Marketplace Fairness Act. The bill now moves to a divided House and if it gets through that body, it would go to President Barack Obama, who has previously expressed his support of the measure. The Marketplace Fairness Act, or Internet Sales Tax, would allow states that collect sales tax on regular purchases at brick-and-mortar retail shops to impose a sales tax on goods sold online to their residents, no matter where the seller is located. States can require online merchants to collect sales tax if they generate $1 million in sales or more in state, even if they do not have a physical presence such as a store or warehouse. For small business owners, as weve reported, the Internet Sales Tax is likely to have a . Small businesses that try to compete with bigger brick-and-mortar shops by selling their products on sites like eBay will now have to consider their prices, factoring in the tax. What once was an appealing deal for consumers because they didnt have to pay a sales tax may not be much of a bargain when sales tax is accounted for. Opponents of the Internet Sales Tax say the bill would turn many small business owners into tax collectors rather than merchants. Small businesses would be burdened by being forced to collect sales tax from more than 9,600 tax jurisdictions across the U.S. If the bill becomes law, small business owners everywhere could be , eEay President and CEO John Donahoe recently said in an open letter opposing the Marketplace Fairness Act. He added that businesses generating less than $10 million in sales or having less than 50 employees should be exempt from the bill if it becomes law. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has been an outspoken critic of the Marketplace Fairness Act. A post from the online merchants advocate We R Here , Imposing a national Internet sales tax while the nation is still trying desperately to create jobs and provide new opportunities for millions of Americans still struggling to find work is economic foolishness. By contrast, the affiliate marketing industry has largely embraced the bill, saying it will eliminate the need for so-called affiliate nexus taxes in six states including Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, North Carolina and Vermont. Those laws have caused online merchants to end their relationships with affiliates in nexus states, causing affiliates in those states to close shop or move across state lines to stay in business.","If your company has a problem and needs expertise your staff doesnt possess, one option is to go to a consultant. Similarly, if you have expertise that might be useful to a small to medium-sized company, becoming a consultant could be the ideal business model for you. Up until now, finding the consultant your company needs at the right price could be a challenge. Same goes for consultants seeking businesses in need of the experience they can offer. But a new website called Quantify says its purpose is to put small to medium sized businesses together with consultants who can help them solve their problems. The site lets business consultants sign up to share their expertise and allows businesses to either schedule a pay-per-minute call with a consultant or post a job with details of what they need done and receive a quote from a consultant interested in your business. Quantify even does some vetting for you ahead of time. Consultants signing up to offer their services provide their experience and background, so they can be matched with the skills a business is looking for. Quantify pledges to screen all applicants to make sure they are qualified. The company also demands that all registered consultants sign a confidentiality agreement upon logging on to use the site. Quantify claims to already have consultants with a wide range of experience. The site says some of its consultants have experience from top tier institutions like Harvard Business School and Yale School of Management and companies like Amazon, Google, Bain Consulting, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, McDonalds Corporation, and more. The company also claims to take some of the other headaches out of the relationship between businesses and consultants. First, Quanify promises to handle all transactions between consultants and clients securely and confidentially on the site. Second, the site promises to cut costs for firms seeking expertise. Instead of paying the overhead often associated with engaging a consulting firm, Quantify claims to offer a pool of qualified consultants competing for your companys business. In a prepared release explaining some of the websites featured, Nizar Noorani, Quantify CTO and co-founder called the process smartsourcing. Businesses or consultants interested in trying the site out can simply visit Quantify and choose to either schedule a call, post a job or sign up to provide services.","During the life of your business, things are bound to change. For example, in the early stages of your business, you may have preferred to keep things simple with an LLC. But as your business and expectations grow, you may need to change your business structure. After all, what may have worked for your business during the first few years of its existence may not be optimal for you now. If youre considering changing your company from one business structure to another, there are a few things to keep in mind. The procedures themselves are not necessarily difficult or complex, but will typically involve some legal steps, such as a merger or the dissolution of one entity and the creation of a new one. As expected, there can be significant tax implications involved with these moves, so seek the advice of an accountant or tax advisor to determine whats best for your business. Here are some of the common scenarios where you might want to change your business structure: For many small businesses, the C corporation ends up being too cumbersome and costly. Maybe you formed your company as a C corporation and quickly discovered what double taxation means. Maybe your tax advisor mentioned you could lower your taxes with the of an S corporation. Fortunately, converting a C corp to an S corp is one of the easiest changes to make; it can be done with a single tax form. If you have a C corporation, you can elect S corporation status by filing no more than 75 days from the date of incorporation, or no more than 75 days from the start of the current tax year. This means that if your C corporation existed on January 1 (and youre a calendar-year taxpayer), youll need to file IRS Form 2553 by March 15 to receive S corporation treatment for the current tax year. Its important to note that the IRS places certain restrictions on who can form S corporations. For example, all shareholders in an S corp must be individuals (not LLCs or partnerships) and legal residents of the United States. If youre like most small business owners, when you started your company, you werent looking for outside investors or thinking about a stock option plan. You just needed a low-frills, easy way to protect your personal assets and track company ownership. Then perhaps your business grew, opportunities emerged, and the time came to consider VC funding. Before you bring in outside investors, youll need to switch your LLC to a C corporation, as it can be more complicated to try converting your business after others are involved in company ownership. The particular steps required to convert an LLC to a corporation depend on the corporate laws in whatever state the LLC is registered. For example, in some cases, youll need to create a new C corporation and then make the original LLC a subsidiary of the newly formed C corp. This is a relatively standard process, and your attorney or online legal filing service will be quite familiar with the steps needed. In fact, most startups and businesses find that this conversion is the simplest part of their Series A round or other financing! If youre a non-U.S. citizen who formed a corporation and is burdened with double taxation, youll need to change your C corp into an LLC to take advantage of pass-through taxation. Thats because the IRS requires owners of an S corp to be U.S. citizens. Most states dont allow C corporations to restructure as an LLC. As a result, youll need to form an LLC and dissolve the C corporation. Just like with changing from an LLC to C corporation, this is a common process that your attorney or online legal filing service can guide you through with relative ease. Theres no reason to stick with a business structure that doesnt work for your business or finances anymore. Remember that its always possible to convert your business structure once your circumstances change.",Wed like to say thanks to this months sponsor of TheAppleBlog:,"Infographics are a popular topic (and sometimes target) for discussion amongst anyone doing online marketing. A sharp uptick in the volume of infographics being created has made getting your graphic heard above the noise more difficult. But infographics can still be an extremely effective tactic for generating awareness, communicating a story and getting traffic and earned links. One challenge some folks run into with infographics and data visualizations (not unlike most types of content) is that they view their industry or area of focus as too boring to generate relevant ideas for infographics that will also get traction socially and with bloggers. After all, to make it a success you need to generate that attention, traffic, and earned links. This is a particularly popular objection with companies considering developing and promoting infographics for B2B marketing. There are a lot of different ways to generate . Businesses are . So well talk specifically about some methods for developing ideas for B2B focused infographics, with examples. One important thing to keep in mind in creating infographics (or other types of content as well, for that matter) is that if you think hard enough about your niche, you can likely come up with an angle that bloggers and press will be interested in. Look at content thats created in publications related to what you do. What types of events and news stories are they regularly focusing coverage on? What kind of interesting data visualization can you create that will add to that coverage and discussion? WordStream (my former employer) created an infographic titled . They createdanother on the ,which . Both were launched right after Google released their quarterly earnings report. The tech and business press are always looking for information and additional angles to talk about earning reports from big companies. So the timing of the graphics release helped in both cases. The nice thing about events like quarterly earnings is that theyre inevitable (they happen every quarter). So you can plan for them and have the graphic ready to launch as they come up. These can be a little trickier because you have to time them specifically with a news event (and frequently you have to get a little lucky regarding when you get the graphic out, as you may be dependent on the shelf life of the story). But if you get it right, you can really have the graphic pop. Veracode, a Web application security company, released the week of a prominent Twitter hack of USA Todays account. As a result, the site received links and mentions from prominent sites like and . Like with any content, if you can cover the key points surrounding a central concept that many people in your niche may be interested in and/or confused by, or if you can explain how to execute on something, people will be willing to share what youve created. There are a number of tactics you can take in creating explainer and how-to infographics for B2B, including: Certain niches just share content more. With infographics, youre typically looking for a topic that will be interesting to bloggers and social sharers. So think about how you might relate your topic back to topics like tech, social media or just passionate folks who blog frequently. Example: parents or folks interested in green living. Maybe you can in a way your readers, and bloggers and sharers, will find interesting. Regardless of how boring you think your B2B product or service may be, you can certainly come up with an idea for a compelling graphic. If you focus on coming up with a topic that bloggers are likely to want to write about and sharers are likely to share, youll even have a strong chance of creating a successful graphic. That still doesnt necessarily mean infographics are for you, though. Good infographics are expensive. They have to be researched, designed and promoted. Even very well thought-out graphics can totally flop and fail to generate much in the way of conversation, links and shares. So if you own a small business and designing a single graphic eats up so much of your budget that you absolutely have to have them be a success, you should probably . With any content marketing activities where youre creating something and then relying on others to link to it, you really need to take a portfolio approach to content creation and promotion. Some of your efforts will fail. Some will be better than you thought. In aggregate, they should provide the returns youre expecting for the total cost youre laying out. If you cant afford to do them more than once, theres a strong chance you should be picking another tactic instead.","As smallbusinesses usemore apps, the data collected in one isnt easily transferred to another. For example, a new customers contact datacollected in one app may have to bemanually entered into all other apps a business uses. Or you have to custom code the integration to allow that data transfer to happenautomatically. Either way can bearduous and expensive. Thats where comes in. Zapier helps connect the Web apps a business uses to reduce the amount of time spent entering repetitive information in those countless apps. And no custom coding is required.Zapier has partnered with more than to date. And now, Zapier is making it easier to connect the apps a small business uses with the introduction of embedded Zaps. Embedded Zaps let you do a one-click integration between apps without even leaving the app youre currently working in. Zaps contain two main elements, a trigger and an action. So, in a formulaic sense: if happens, then . When something happens in one app, Zapier gets alerted and is commanded to perform a task in another app. Want an email from a Gmail account copied to your Evernote account? Zapier handles that based on the commands you give it. A new customers email address entered into PayPal for the first time can be zapped directly to a MailChimp email newsletter list. The difference with the newembedded Zaps, is that businesses looking to streamline their information wont have to leave the app theyre currently using to set up these commands. Jason Kotenko, Head of Partnerships atZapier, says embedded Zaps make the process even easier. Embedded Zaps enable our partners to better serve their own users. With embedded Zaps, partners can keep customers inside their ecosystem without sending them off-site to zapier.com, explains Kotenko in an emailed comment. Alex Turnbull, the CEO at , a help desk software solution, says the ability to use Zaps from right within Groove should help users tremendously. Groove customers will now be able to integrate their help desk with their other favorite tools, without having to know anything about writing code, says Turnbull in an email interview with Small Business Trends. For example, in just a few clicks, a user can set up a Zap that will send them an SMS alert anytime a new Groove message comes in, he explains. Or, they could set up a Zap that connects Groove with their teams project management app (e.g., Pivotal Tracker, Trello, Basecamp, etc.), so that new tasks can be created from support tickets without ever having to leave Groove. With more than 350 apps on the Zapier platform, the possibilities are tremendous. See example in the screenshot above. We expect this to be a massive time-saver for Groove customers, adds Turnbull.","Theres a reason Ive written so much about cloud computing (sometimes called software-as-a-service or Web-based software services).

The list presents corporate bad loans accounted for since 2005 against which banks have not moved the courts  in banking parlance they are dubbed as non-suit filed accounts. The top 10 corporate defaulters, according to RBIs list, owe over Rs 56,000 crore to banks and financial institutions. To put this in perspective, this amount is just shy of the budget of West Bengal for the 2016-2017 fiscal year (which stands at close to Rs 57,000 crore). Most of these defaults are to state-owned banks and insurance companies  specifically Life Insurance Corporation of India and General Insurance Corporation of India. The majority of the top 10 defaulters are either state-owned companies or firms with promoters with some political connections. Which means this is public money at stake. It must be noted, however, that RBIs Wilful Defaulters and Defaulting Borrowers List is only a part of the non-performing asset, or NPA, puzzle. According to Credit Information Bureau (India), wilful defaults against which civil suits have been filed for recovery amount to Rs 56,521 crore. If we add these amounts, total NPAs stand at about Rs 5.5 lakh crore. Of this, only Rs 1.5 lakh crore (both suit and non-suit filed accounts) are termed wilful defaults by banks. (This does not account for restructured loans.) Considering how wilful defaults are only a fraction of the total bad loans, it begs the question of whether we need to stress on the distinction between wilful and non-wilful defaults while addressing the NPA issue. The assessed by Newslaundry is part of RBIs Negative List and is updated quarterly to be circulated among banks across the country. It is, in principle, a sort of watch-out-for-these-borrowers list that banks can look up before extending a loan. It accounts for defaults above Rs 25 lakh since 2005 and was last updated on 24December, 2015. .","Its been nearly six years since the Great Recession began and four years since the current economic recovery started, making it a good time to take stock of where small business stands. The National Federation of Independent Businesss (NFIB)s provides some clues. The overall message from the data is this: Small business is doing better than it was at the start of the economic recovery, but has not yet returned to pre-recession conditions. The NFIBs effort is the longest-running survey of small business owners. While it is not a representative sample  it covers only members of the NFIB  the number of topics it includes, and the length of the series, make it a valuable source of information about small business owners opinions. I looked at responses to 21 questions that I think are most indicative of small business economic conditions. I focused on data gathered during three July surveys (to avoid issues of seasonality): in 2007 (before the Great Recession), in 2009 (when the recovery was just beginning) and in 2013 (now). I divided the questions into three categories  the current situation, access to credit, and views of the future. Some of the measures are now close to 2007 levels, but not a single one has returned completely to prerecession levels. Most, but not all, are more positive than they were when the economic recovery began. Consider the numbers in Table 1, which includes questions that assess the current situation of small businesses. The net percentage of businesses that reported having higher sales three months earlier was -1 in July of 2007. That is, one percent more businesses reported lower sales than higher sales for the April to June 2007 period than for the January to March 2007. By contrast, when the recovery was just beginning in July 2009 the net percentage was -34. That is, 34 percent more companies reported lower sales than higher sales over the three months from April to June 2009 than for January to March 2009. This July, the net percentage was -7: a better situation than in 2009, but worse than in 2007. Or consider the data on job openings at small businesses. In July 2007, 23 percent of companies had unfilled positions. In July 2009, that fraction was down to 9 percent. In July of 2013, the number was back to 20 percent  an improvement on 2009 but worse than in 2007. Table 2 shows the responses to questions about access to credit. While a greater fraction of businesses reported having their credit needs satisfied in July 2013 than in July 2009  30 percent versus 28 percent  the more recent fraction remains lower than in July 2007 when it was 37 percent. By contrast, the percentage of regular borrowers does not appear to have recovered at all. The share of companies borrowing at least once every three months fell from 36 percent in July 2007 to 33 percent in July 2009 and then fell again to 31 percent in July 2013. Table 3 shows small business owners views of the future. Responses to most of the outlook questions were more negative this July than in July 2007, though they are largely more positive than in July 2009. For instance, when asked if the next three months are a good time to expand only 9 percent said yes in July, compared to 16 percent in July of 2007 and 5 percent in July of 2009. Similarly, back in July 2007, 23 percent more small business owners planned to increase hiring than decrease it. That number was much lower in July 2009 when 3 percent more small business owners planned to cut hiring than to expand it. In July 2013, the number was again positive  9 percent more owners planned to add workers than lay them off  but it remained lower than in 2007. In short, the NFIB data show that small business is doing better than it was when the recovery first began. The data also show that small business is not doing as well as before the Great Recession. What the data dont tell us is whether the recovery for small business is just painfully slow or whether small business will never again do as well as it did in 2007.","eBay plans a new mobile ad network to be launched by the end of 2014. The network would allow advertisers to target 4.6 million daily visitors to eBays mobile app. The company unveiled details with a new page on its official website recently. Announcing the new service, the company : The new network would operate similar to ad services offered by competitors like Twitter, Facebook, or Google. Ads placed through eBay will appear on eBay mobile app pages. But eBay claims ads placed on its network would target a much more highly engaged audience. And that audience spends almost three times as long on the app (more than 290 million hours of shopping a week) as the audiences of eBays closest competitors, the company says. eBay claims there are currently 149 million active users of its mobile app. And in 2013, they drove nearly $75 billion in sales through the app. So thats a huge number of potential customers looking at your ads. Whats more, eBay is touting the fact that its ability to gather detailed data including the shopping histories of millions of buyers who use the app will allow advertisers to target very specific markets. In the new announcement, eBay also introduces its Audience Discovery tool which the company says advertisers can use to leverage data collected about users of eBays mobile app. The tool will let advertisers uncover the specific audience segment they wish to reach. Advertisers can pick from 60 pre-selected audience segments to target their message. And if none of those choices quite fit, eBay says the Audience Discovery tool will use data collected from mobile app users to refine a more specific target market to meet advertising needs. eBay is looking at the new advertising network as a new source of revenue for the company. But there is also the danger ads will drag potential customers away to rival retail sites, Greg Bensinger in the Wall Street Journals Digits Blog. suggests on the Digits blog. Its unknown if eBaay will place any restrictions on the type of ads placed to avoid advertisers conflicting with the companys business model. Mobile and online ad networks have been a hot trend among the leading online companies lately. Earlier this year, and Twitter has made several investments recently that show its intention of expanding its ad networks reach. to more publishers.","As is true of so many things in life, the big boys have it a whole lot easier than the rest of us. Fishing for backlinks in exchange for money can be risky (not to mention deeply unethical), but that didnt stop Hotels.com, an Expedia property, from sending out spammy emails asking travel bloggers for precisely that. Earlier this month, a number of influential travel bloggers received an email from an as-yet unnamed SEO Manager for Hotels.coms Americas division. The poorly-written email was sent from a Hotels.com email address, and claimed that the SEO Manager had been reading the bloggers posts. The sender went on to ask if the recipients would be interested in some brand promotion for our hotels. So far, so good, right? Unfortunately (for Hotels.com), the phrasing of the email soon took a detour into black-hat territory. The sender, who until the end of the email had been asking for hotel reviews or more neutral content, such as Brought to you by Hotels.com, then gave the game away by explicitly asking how much the bloggers wanted to be paid for helping Hotels.com acquire backlinks: Oh dear. Predictably, Hotels.com was quick to distance itself from the shady machinations of the SEO Manager. In a canned response shortly after the incident came to light, Hotels.com issued the following statement: Presumably, the internal misunderstanding was that this type of back-alley shenanigans should never have been made public  and the SEO Manager responsible has been fired. Aside from being risky business, Hotels.coms attempts to buy backlinks from bloggers highlights just how often large, well-known sites get away with underhanded tactics that would otherwise ruin small businesses trying to do the same thing. Not convinced? Lets take a look at other questionable tactics being employed by Hotels.com. Do a search for Hotels.com and youll see firsthand how the site leverages its size and power to game the system: Apparently, the Hotels.com domain has almost 36 million pages indexed in Google. Even an SEO novice could see that somethings up. Theres no possible way that Hotels.com could have that many legitimate pages on its site. (WordStreamis quite large and we only have 14,000 indexed results.) So whats the deal with all those pages? Well, Hotels.com is using computer-generated pages featuring thin content and link farms to game the algorithm. The site has a page for virtually every city/state/region/hotel name in the world: This massive content farm is supported by aggressive, automated internal linking to further boost rankings: Ads are injected to bulk up all this thin content and further monetize pageviews: A few final thoughts. Hotels.com is a paid-link supported content farm that just so happens to offer hotel bookings. The site is using virtually every trick in the book to boost its rankings. When it comes to dodgy SEO tactics, brands get away with murder. Major brands still purchase backlinks to game their search rankings, despite the risks. The practice is common knowledge among those in the know. And SEO is too important to sites like this for management to not know of these kinds of tactics.Google spam algorithms still have a long way to go towards cleaning up the SERPS.","Katie De Valles passion is cookies. The owner of ,De Valle has been selling cookies on Etsy for a few years now. But a negative experience with the site recently inspired her to start a new venture. In short, De Valle had a customer, who also happened to be a seller on Etsy, complain about an order. Though she says that she didnt include gift tags in the item listings or promise them, the customer filed a claim with the site over not receiving any gift tags. And De Valles shop was shut down until she offered a full refund. Though upset by this incident, it inspired her to start . The site isnt meant to be a direct competitor of Etsy. Instead, De Valle is focusing on her main passion: cookies. Users can sell any kind of baked goods or baking supplies on the site. De Valle said in a phone interview with Small Business Trends, I was initially thinking that Id like to do something similar to Etsy. But my thing has always been all about food. So I thought it would be better to focus on things like cookies and all sorts of baked goods. Its not the first site to offer this type of platform for bakers and foodies. But De Valle plans to set hers apart by really focusing on creating a fair experience for both buyers and sellers. In fact, shes already hired a team of 50 to oversee any issues that may arise. In addition, Artsy Central only takes a 3 percent fee when users make a sale, but no listing or monthly fees on top of that. Artsy Central also isnt the first site to pop up offering an alternative to at least some of the sellers who would normally flock to Etsy.And De Valle doesnt just attribute that trend to order disputes like the one she experienced. Theres been some frustration in the handmade community as of late over some of . The site that once focused exclusively on items that were completely handcrafted by artisans, or vintage or supply items, now has a bit more of an open structure. That focus on really unique items from artists who love their work isnt as strong. And instead, sellers can outsource production of their items or even sell products theyve bought in a wholesale capacity. The site isnt exactly struggling to find shoppers or sellers, even with the changes. But it does create a new opportunity for competitors to woo those who are a bit disillusioned over the whole Etsy experience. De Valles niche makes Artsy Central unique. But its still part of a growing trend that could see even more companies trying to get a share of the handmade marketplace. And for now, De Valle is keeping her Etsy shop open, since she is still in the process of getting the new Artsy Central platform up and running. But she says once the site takes off, she plans to focus all of her efforts on that.","How does one create Indias biggest and arguably the most well-known ed-tech company? If you ask Byju Raveendran of Byjus Classes, hell tell you its by competing with yourself, and not others. His passion and drive are infectious. At TechSparks 2015, Byjus talk had focused around making students love learning, get addicted to learning. This may sound a bit over-the-top coming from anyone else, but Byju has proved it by creating something extraordinary by addressing the root of the problem  making learning both engaging and personalized. YourStory caught up with Byju at the companys headquarters at Koramangala in Bangalore, a high-energy place, buzzing with not just activity but also a high level of excitement among both staff and students. Byjus started off small, as an offline test prep provider for CAT, GRE, GMAT, JEE & Med, and the Civil Services exams. It thenexpanded into coaching for Classes 11 and 12, and further to Classes 6-10. Hes often be described as a maths genius, but hes a shrewd entrepreneur too.His company has raised over $40 million in funds from the likes of and of the & . Many of his former students now work with him, as teachers and course developers. Byju has spent countless hours teaching maths for entrance exams, and his zeal to transform the nature of learning, working on innovation 247, has brought Byjus so far ahead of being just another test prep provider.To cut a long story short, Byjus growth catalyst, along with his ambition, was going mobile. We have been a very successful offline brand, but last year we launched our first application through a mobile platform, and that has helped us leapfrog to the next level in terms of users, he says, and reiterates his mantra of personalized learning: We are making an impact where it matters, and how students learn in those crucial years where they start failing (in a) subject, in the 6 or 7 grades. We know we are making a much bigger impact because we are changing the way India is learning today. They currently reach over 20 lakh students, all of whom are free users, and are adding nearly 20,000 students every month. But heres what makes them successful  Byjus is clocking 20 per cent month-on-month growth in terms of converting around 20 per cent of those into serious, paid users. When you know how high-energy, passionate and driven Byju is, the numbers suddenly seem very realistic. It all stems from his growing-up years, when he always went beyond the curriculum and guide books. He attributes the success to the time spent outside the classroom. Thats why I advise all students that there are a lot of things that you need to learn from books, but there is a lot more that you can learn outside the classrooms by playing multiple gameswhatever passion you see, the energy which you see, the positive aggression you see is mostly because the amount of time I have spent outside my classrooms  that helped me in multiple ways, he explains. One is to learn the real-lifeskills, which is helping me to make bigger and bigger impactand that kind of forced me to learn on my own. So from the beginningI used to learn below and above the curriculum. The subjects I used to like I used to learn, and the subjects I kind of never used to like, I used to still follow what most of the students are following today which is about memorizing, replicating and then forgetting. Hes so focused on talking about the content they create and how they deliver it that its almost tough to get him to talk about himself  after all, he is the brand; its literally and figuratively his name on the door. So whats been his key success? If you ask me where I have been successful, its in recreating a lot more Byjus or better than the original Byju.Thats because I have been able to sell my vision of making an impact in terms of how the students are learning and why that is important. Coming from my kind of background, I know that education is what I am today and education is the only way to make it big or the best way to make it big, depending on which section (of society) you belong to, he replies honestly and to the point. So how does he keep going through the challenges  setting up and running a business and constantly innovating? Its very simple. In one sentence if you ask me:increase your aspirational level as much as possible, because none of us ever made our aspirational level. And keep on losing to yourself, try beating yourself every day, compete with yourself day in and day out. Especially when you are creating something which people have not done before, the competition has to be with yourself, he explains as clearly as the concepts in the videos his company puts out. Never one to take things slow, Byju has firmly set his sights on the international stage, to become the biggest such company in the world. The idea is to reach there in the next four years is what I tell investors and everyone else, but we will reach there much faster, because my target internally is much more aggressive, he says with all the energy of an enthusiastic entrepreneur who knows exactly what hes set out to do. And when its Byju saying it, disruption suddenly doesnt seem like a tall order.","With the release of new Google+ Local pages, Google is increasingly promoting local business, and they arent alone.

(Not about how Dr. Pinketts appearance on The Apprentice would play into the book. Nor was I swayed by the curious on-air incident when Trump asked if Dr. Pinkett would let his runner up be a co-winner.) What got me is the books timing. The post-racial generation is professionally coming to an age when entrepreneurial dreams and considerations for management positions are in view. I wondered how this generational shift would play against past advice for African-American professionals, especially when much of it came from very savvy and legendary leaders who had no blueprint for building careers in post-Civil-Rights America. This book delivers splendidly (Thanks, Ivana). s shows how networking, occupational excellence and cooperative synergy can come together to help African-American professionals master their career choices. Dr. Pinkett recalls his Apprentice experience, but then turns the moment into culturally reasoned examination of how Black professionals must weigh challenges which are not overtly racial, yet cause one to wonder about others intentions, particularly in settings in which the professional is also the only minority. It is this wonder that establishes the title. Ten strategies, each for a career stage that leads to the next, are explained. The first three are grouped as Learning the Game  developing yourself and obtaining broad exposure to develop excellence in your field. The next three focus on playing the game  networking by building solid relationships with others and seeking mentor relationships. The third segment deals with providing value through entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial skills. The final segment ends the journey through giving back to those who helped along the way. makes its case for networking without using social media. Like , the book emphasizes traditional Black institutions as networking resources and shows tables regarding the fit of the organizations with each career stage. Enlightening breakdowns such as the Four Facets for Excellence and Nine Forms of Intelligence help readers understand their own characteristics so they can select organizations to join and in which to shine. The authors approach to career decision making is memorable, recapping stages to provide perspective on their usage. The emphasis on mastering ones occupation nicely extends that of earlier successful books on the topic such as by Earl Graves and by Price Cobb. Some readers may read and feel, Hey, I know that already, from their personal experiences, but the fun of reading anything is that the text may articulate your own thoughts more succinctly, more accurately or just plain ol . For anyone with an interest in African-American culture from a corporate or entrepreneurial perspective, delivers that more real in an organized fashion and makes any professional challenge more clear. One small misstep is a mention of by Ellis Cose as providing examples of professionals dissatisfied about their choices and lacking passion. Despite their own acceptance, the professionals in , against a backdrop of affirmative action politics and the socio-economic division of suburbs versus urban centers, felt resentment over slights and the pressure to be excellent from being the first in their industries. (Similar examples occur in , by Henry Louis Gates, and in by Beverly Hall Lawrence.) Admittedly, from my end, this nit overlooks the segments advice to not prioritize prestige, promotions, or position over passion. But this mention also underscores the generational shift that the book notes, through its examples of successful African Americans at every age and through its excellent mention of points such as multiculturalism: Dr. Pinkett and Dr. Robinson succeed in their closing points about cooperative spirit, particularly on building institutions. They challenge this generation of entrepreneurs to seek institution-building and to ask themselves how they can work together. The significance of institution-building extends into the theme of the last segment, which focuses on building synergy to jointly cooperate among professionals and to create a larger sense of self. Dr. Robinson and Dr. Pinkett (@randalpinkett) have more than achieved their purpose for . It challenged me, and I think it will challenge others who have concerns on bridging the diversity in the African American community, as well as spark interest for anyone with multicultural interest in organizations. Inspired by their words, I have to say Dr. Robinson and Dr. Pinkett have created true transforming synergy with , with actionable results for any professional, whether he or she aspires to be a corporate executive or an entrepreneur.","The sequester is here. Over the next seven months, federal agencies need to trim their budgets by $85 billion. How much will this budget cutting exercise cost small business contractors? Coming up with a precise estimate isnt easy. Only some of the federal budget cuts will come from spending on outside contractors. And the cuts to contracts will be borne mostly by big businesses since thats . More importantly, only some of these budget cuts will affect cash disbursements. My first thought was to look at the numbers coming out of Washington. But after examining several of them, I am convinced that they arent plausible, perhaps because they are politically motivated. For example, the Democrats on the House Small Business Committee released a report estimating that small companies will lose $7.6 billion worth of federal contracts because of the sequester. Thats a whopping 18 percent of will be the decline in total federal cash disbursements this year. My calculations  imprecise as they are  suggest that the effect on small business revenues will be much smaller for three reasons. First, the federal government will only cut this years cash disbursements by half of the amount that budgets will be trimmed. As the : Second, contracting accounts for only about 15 percent of federal spending, . Slicing 15 percent from the $42 billion in cash disbursements amounts to only $6.3 billion cut from federal contractors. While agency directors might prefer to cut contracting by more, their hands are tied. Not only do federal officials lack discretion when it comes to making cuts under the sequester, but also much of what is being spent this year was contractually agreed upon in previous years. Third, most federal contracting dollars go to big companies. In 2011  the latest year data are available  only about 22 percent of the money Washington paid to contractors went to small businesses, the . Assuming small and big business contractors take a proportional hit to their revenues, small business contractors will take in about $1.4 billion less in revenue this year. Thats not a lot. Its approximately 0.1 percent of the small business sectors annual revenues, given the latest Census Bureau revenue estimates. If you are a small business owner whose business relies heavily on small business contracting, . But for the small business sector overall, the sequesters impact on revenues will be slight.","For those entrepreneurs itching to start their own business, purchasing a franchise can be a good alternative. Franchising can be less risky than starting a business from scratch. The franchisor has done a lot of the work for you. The business plan is ready made; theres already strong brand name recognition, and the franchisor is often responsible for the marketing and advertising. However, any new business is risky, even a franchise. You may get an established name and business plan, but your success is ultimately up to you. If you are considering taking the leap to become a franchisee this year, here are five tips: Whether you identify a potential franchise opportunity from a franchise broker or franchise exposition, you alone are solely responsible for the due diligence before you invest. Start by reading the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) to find out important details about the franchise company, litigation and bankruptcy history, as well as your initial fees, investment, and obligations. According to franchise expert and consultant , potential franchisees should: For Libava, its critical to speak with other franchisees before signing on the dotted line. about the total investment: Maybe they can introduce you to their lender and you can get a similar small business loan from them. Lastly, Libava says: Successful restaurant and store owners will tell you it all comes down to location, location, location. One of the toughest, and most important, decisions a franchisee will make is choosing a location for their new business. Many franchisors will work closely with you to pick the perfect site, sharing insights about what particular site characteristics lead to success with their organization. However, at the end of the day, the decision is ultimately yours. Youll need to understand your target demographic and what drives customers to this particular franchise. Then evaluate each location accordingly. Consider details like traffic patterns, parking, nearby stores, and check with the franchisor if youll be guaranteed protected territory (i.e. no other franchise can open within a certain radius). Buying a franchise gives you a proven model and a clear-cut marketing plan to bring in new customers. However, its up to you to define the customer experience. Employee-customer interactions can make or break any business. Hire customer-centric staff who will go the extra mile to leave an extraordinary impression on your customers. In addition, you need to be realistic about your management experience. If you have never managed a team before, youll need training on how to manage people effectively. The tax rules and contracts surrounding franchises can get quite complex. You should consult an attorney, preferably one who specializes in franchise law, to review your franchise agreement documents and identify any potential red flags. In addition, an accountant can help you understand the full costs of purchasing and operating the business, as well as evaluate tax considerations. Given the size of the investment youll be making, its prudent to pay a little upfront for a professional consult. For franchisees, a (like a corporation or LLC) is critical to separate your personal assets from the business. While the will ultimately depend on the specifics of your situation, many franchisees choose to become an LLC or S Corporation for more favorable tax treatment. These two entities give you the option to choose pass-through tax treatment. In this case, your business doesnt file its own taxes; any profits or losses of the business are passed through to your personal taxes. Many franchisors prefer to sign contracts with established companies (LLC or corporation) rather than , so you may want to incorporate or form an LLC before you sign the franchise agreement. In most cases, youll want to located (and not the state where the franchise is headquartered). While you may want an attorney to review your franchise contract and paperwork, you dont necessarily need an attorney to incorporate. If youre interested in exploring a franchise opportunity, there are plenty of resources to help you get started: Bureau of Consumer Protection:   (SBDC) Browse for opportunities and do your homework. Maybe this will be the year you take the reigns and become a business owner.","Entrepreneurs and small business owners are notorious for not taking vacations. find it difficult to take vacations, according to theJune 2015Office Depot Small Business Index.

If you have more than onemanager on your team and they are peers, it may help to designate one of them to be the main person in charge, in case of emergency. Accept that mistakes will happen. Be sure your deputy knows he or she has your full confidence. But what if you dont have managers? Thats when you have to be clearer with your employees. They may need special instructions as to their authority and how far that authority extends. Make sure they know when to reach out to you. You wont like thinking about that stack of unfinished projectswhen youredigging your toes in the sand, with sunscreen in one hand and a margaritain the other. If you havent got a staff to delegate towhen youre inching out the door, heres how toclearsome of this stuff off your plate before you leave. Simply log an extra hour or two eachday for a week or two in advance, whittling away those projects. Thats much better than pulling an all-nighter just before youre dueto drive 12 hours to the beach. If you are a procrastinator, start with the easiest task first. Finish it  and the feeling of accomplishment may just get you fired up enough to tackleanother project. And another. Projects delivered before deadline make clients happy. And happy clients are less likely to fill your email box with missives or bug you byphonewhile youre trying to decompress in paradise. Tell key people, such as clients andothers who are used to dealing with youpersonally, that youll be away. It sets expectations. Knowing that, most people will not make urgent demands just before you leave. Notify them afew weeksbefore your departure. Then provide another reminder a few daysbefore you pack your bags.

Discussing your vacation plans makes you a bit more human in their eyes. Youre no longer just the owner of a business.

That way, when a new emailcomes in, the sender gets an immediate response back that theyre out of the office. Simply adapt the message in Tip 3 above. For Microsoft Office 365, set up the feature. Or for Outlook desktop versions. GMail and Google Apps email have an feature that is easy toset up. Dont forget your voicemail, either. Consider leaving a recorded messagealerting people that youre out and will be returning messages more slowly than usual. Heres a sample vacation voicemail message: Important: put a reminder in your calendar to swap out thosemessagesas soon asyou get back. Dont be the person who still has that old vacation voicemail message playing weeks later. Dont automatically assume everything will go wrong in your absence  it wont! But as youre getting ready for vacation, do try to anticipatepotential scenarios that might blow up. Brief your team. Explain what you would do in each situation. And assure themits okay to contact you if they feel the situation is beyond them. Its better to interrupt your vacation for an hour, than to spend days fixinga minidisaster on your return. Make a list oftwo types ofemergency numbers to give to key employees. The first set of emergency numbers is your own, for employees who might need to reach you. A mobile phone number is best. Give an alternate, too, just in case yours is turned off or the battery is dead perhaps your spouses mobile phone. Specify whether you want texts or calls. Ashort text message exchange can be less intrusive than a voice call, yetmore immediate than email. Next on the emergency contact list, designate people who may be able to answer questionsin your absence. This list could include yourbusiness insurance agent, attorney or IT consultant. Go over important business procedures that you will be delegating in your absence. For example, someone other than you may need toopen the shop in the morning or close the office at night. Typical procedures that trip people up include: Ask the employee to perform the procedures for you a couple of times before you leave. Always write down the procedures as a backup, too.

Unpaid bills have a way of nagging and intruding in our minds. Who needs that? Leave for your vacation with a clean slate of accounts payable. Pay invoices, credit card statements and bills that will come due while youre gone. Make sure payroll is set up to be processed while youre gone as well. This might seem obvious, but the problem ariseswhen people try to go by memory. Or they forget about recurring teleconferences and standing meetings that dont appearon their calendar. Actually check your calendar  before you leave. And take a moment to consciously think about those standing meetings and calls, so you can tell people not to expect you. Resist the temptationto take work with you.If you are glued to your laptop or phone, it not only will spoil your time but your familys time, too. Imagine the grumpy faces of your family as they sit around waiting for you to get off the phone, so you can all go hiking. Still, most business owners do wantto stay in touch. They just dont want to involve themselves so much that it stops feelinglike a vacation. Seventy-six percent of business owners check their phones and email on vacation, according to the Office Depot Small Business Index survey. If you must stay in touch with your business, limit it toa specific time sloteach day.For example, you could set aside one half hour each morning at 9 a.m. to fieldmessages thatcant wait orcheck in with staff. Oncethe 30 minutes areover,give yourself permission togo play with a clear conscience. Luckily, technology has made it easier than ever to stay in touch remotely. For those who dont have staff, but still need to handle a few critical tasks while on vacation, mobile devices are a godsend. A tablet or even a smartphone can substitute for a laptop while away.Just take the time to download a few key mobile appsin advanceif you need to. A good app can make mobiletransactions faster and easier. Documentsstored in the cloud can be accessedfrom a smartphone or tablet. If you dont use the cloud, take a few minutes before you leaveto transfer critical files to a thumb drive. Remember: alittle R and R can bring some ROI (return on investment). Upon your return, share yourmemories with your team for a few minutes. Not to bore them or make them feel bad that you were on vacation and they werent  but to revealyour human side. It strengthensstaff relationships. Anice touch is to bring something inexpensive back for team members, if practical. Boxes of saltwater taffy, T-shirts or coffee mugs all around show you thought about your team and you care. Its good planning to let almost everyone know you are leaving on vacation. But today theres a big exception: social media sites. Here are some pointers for the security conscious:","If youre still not sure social media is worth the investment, try this one for size:  According to a May survey by virtual events provider , social media is now the among technology marketers.   And while that could seem somewhat skewed based on their occupation, the point is this  social media delivers qualified leads. While the conversations, brand awareness and friends make you feel good, thats not the power of social media.  The power of social media is that it connects you to qualified leads and puts more money into your bank account. According to the Unisfair survey, 66 percent of respondents said lead generation their greatest concern for 2010. The findings seem to match R2integrateds April survey that found 61 percent of respondents were after lead generation, as well as HubSpots report that . In case you need a recap: . Why is social media such an effective lead generation tool? Its easy. :  When you put content on your Web site, no one but your current customers or prospects see it.  When you upload that same content to Facebook, to YouTube, to StumbleUpon, to Flickr, to Twitteryou take advantage of larger and larger networks.  Networks that have thousands of active users who are there to consume and share content.  The more people who see it, the more brand awareness you earn, and the more people who will be driven back to your Web site and placed in a conversion funnel that you create. : Stop what youre doing and go to .  Click on the Advanced Search option (or just click that link) and create a Saved search designed to pick up sitting ducks.  For example, if youre a local mechanic, you may want to set up a search for [brake job], [car inspection] or [oil change].  Set the distance for 25 miles from your place of business and then save the search.   Now any time someone in your local area tweets about needing a brake job, a car inspection or an oil change, youll be notified. And then you can reach out to that person.     You can also create searches for you competitors and try to steal those conversions away. :  While youre near Twitter Search, enter in some business-related keywords and look for folks asking questions about whatever it is youre an expert at.  When you can, answer them.  Go to Yahoo Answers, Business Answers and any other relevant question/answer site and do the same thing.    This is a great way to increase leads by using your expertise to pre-qualify you for the job.  For example, my Twitter friend commented that he often answers peoples WordPress-related questions and has received both freelance and long term clients from it.  Answering questions is a good way to establish your authority, but also for people to test you out before they commit to a larger contract. : One of the most obvious ways social media delivers leads is through social media referrals.  Through your interactions on Twitter, on Facebook, wherever, you make your presence known to colleagues and users.   You converse with them and develop relationships so that they feel like they know you. Then, when they have a job they cant take or they hear about someone in their network looking for a local caterer, they remember you and recommend you for the job. : Another way that social media can deliver leads is by connecting you to other professionals in your area that you can talk, debate and share information with.  For example, I belong to the and groups.  Both groups serve as discussion forums for people to share advice and to pass on referrals or freelance opportunities as they come up.  Its a great way to connect and build trust. Social media is an emerging lead generation tool because, quite simply, it lowers the barrier to the sale. By building relationships, displaying expertise and networking, youre able to bring in more people than cold calling ever could. How are you using social media for lead generation?","Whats the best way to give your some battery life? With the , of course.

While its quite normal to get stressed out, given that we all lead fast-paced lives where a deadline to complete a task sounds more alarming than missing out on a family outing, we should be wary of the possibility of cracking under excess pressure.

With a healthy and growing subscriber list, you can generate more leads and net more sales through every mailing. Once you know the right timing and have a good content strategy for your mailing list, you should concentrate on how to increase email list signups. The tips below will help you do this right from your small business blog, and keep your subscriber base expanding. If you dont already have one, a Feature Box on your blog can give you a significant increase in subscribers. The Feature Box is the area between your header and your content  if youre running your blog on WordPress, there are some templates, such as and , that have customizable feature boxes built right in. You can also build a Feature Box in WordPress with widgets. Most people enjoy getting something for nothing. If you have an eBook, whitepaper or special report thats associated with your business, you can give it away free to anyone who signs up for your email list. One great way to increase email list signups with this tactic is to offer your free eBook or other bonus right in your Feature Box. If youre fresh out of eBooks to give away, or your business doesnt really lend itself to long-form content, you can entice more subscribers by offering them exclusive content that isnt published to general visitors. This might be a regular newsletter, video content or something as simple as read-it-first links, where you send subscribers private links to new blog posts before you make them public. For small business blogs running on the WordPress platform, there are several plugins that will help you increase email list signups with professional opt-in boxes and forms. The Magic Action Box lets you create a Feature Box or other opt-in forms that are customized to your brand. Theres also the Bueno Gato Free Popup Creator , which does just what the name implies. Many people are using lightbox-style popups that gray out the rest of the page  which can work, but can also really annoy your visitors unless theyre done well. Luckily, theres a more unique way to attract subscribers with popups. The free is a narrow strip that pops up along the top edge of your blog. You can customize this to either , or have them enter their email address directly in the bar. While you dont want to go crazy with opt-in boxes, you should have at least one place on every page of your blog where people can subscribe to your email list. Place signup boxes at the top of the page (use a Feature Box for best effect), in the sidebar and at the end of every post. With the individual post opt-in boxes, you can include a brief call to action. For example: Enjoy this post? Enter your email address to sign up for our list, and get notified whenever we post fresh content. If youre not getting many email list signups, changing the wording on your calls to action can help. Try performing A/B testing on different wording, such as Get Email Updates, Subscribe Today, or even Download Now! if youre offering a freebie for subscribers. Then stick with the wording that performs the best. Social sharing is a great way to attract more visitors and increase email list signups. To boost your social media circulation, be sure to somewhere in your page template, and at the end of every blog post. People who are subscribed to your blog receive email notifications whenever you post new content. Some marketers insist that using partial RSS feeds, which send only snippets of your posts to subscribers and require them to click through for the rest, are better because they increase traffic to your blog. However, partial RSS feeds can serve to annoy subscribers, and they may not bother clicking through. If you allow full RSS feeds, youll not only get your content read more often, but youll also be emailing the opt-in form at the end of your posts to all of your RSS subscribers. The more people who find their way to your blog, the more potential email list signups you have. So, one of the best ways to increase email list signups is to make sure your blog is optimized for search engines, and therefore bringing you more traffic.","San Jose City Council Approves Tesla Plant: The San Jose City Council unanimously voted to approve Tesla Motors new electric car manufacturing plant.

When a customer takes the time to give you a not-so-flattering review, that is your opportunity to do one of four things:","Small businesses have a better bet seeking loans with small banks than with big ones.Small business loan approval drops to 18.8 percent at big banks in March. (Those are banks with assets of $10 billion or more.)The new figure represents a drop from 19.1 percent in February. The drop in lending at bigger banks is not part of an overall slowdown in lending either. A year-over-year comparison shows lending increased by 20 percent at big banks over the last year overall.The figures come from the Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index. The index is based on a monthly analysis of 1000 loan applications on . In a prepared release issued with the monthly index report, Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora explains: At the same time, small business loans at small banks are on the upswing.Loan approvals for small businesses at small banks rose from 51.4 percent to 51.6 percent over the same period. Rohit gave one possible reason for the increased lending at these smaller institutions. That would be the increased popularity of the Small Business Administrations Small Business Loan Program and SBA Express with these lenders.The SBA offers to guarantee up to 85 percent of these loans with no guarantee fees, which Rohit says has made them very popular. However, another reason could be the increased flow of higher quality borrowers who are less interested in alternative lenders like merchant advance services as the economy improves.Rohit says these borrowers are increasingly shopping around for better lending rates and terms with small banks and institutional lenders like credit funds and insurance companies.

At the Multi Commodity Exchange, cardamom for delivery in October rose by Rs 17.10 or 1.50 per cent to Rs 1,154.50 per kg in business turnover of 102 lots. Likewise, the spice for delivery in September contracts was trading higher by Rs 8.60 or 0.76 per cent to Rs 1140 per kg in 3 lots. Market analysts said apart from a firming trend at spot market on rising domestic as well as export demand, restricted arrivals from producing belts mainly kept cardamom prices higher at futures trade.","As a small business owner, it can sometimes feel like youre expected to be an expert in tax and state law. One common area of confusion and misconception is conducting business in multiple states. By law, if your company plans to conduct business in any other states than your state of incorporation (or LLC formation), then you may need to register your business in those states. This process is called . For example In todays mobile/virtual world, it can be difficult to know just what constitutes doing business in a state. If youre uncertain whether your particular business needs to foreign qualify, you should check with your attorney or accountant. However, here are some general questions to answer: If you answered yes to any of these, your business may need to file a foreign qualification in the appropriate state.","A lot of us are uncomfortable with the idea of self-promotion. Weve been told that its bad and that if our product is worth it, other people will do our promoting for us.  And thats true, if youre a mega brand.   But people cant promote what they dont know about and, as a small business owner, the burden falls on you to make sure that people know you exist and what youre up to. You do that by putting yourself out there and alerting people when your company does something great. If you wont sing your own praises, then why would anyone else do it for you? Unfortunately, the first step of self-promoting is convincing yourself that its OK.  How do you do that? : If you start heavily promoting your content, some of your customers are going to be upset about it.  They may still live in the imaginary world where good content naturally rises to the top and where small business owners shouldnt be marketers.  Thats OK and you need to accept it before you start. Remember, its not your job to market to everyone. Its your job to market to people who like what youre doing, and to grow your business.  Part of growing your business means getting comfortable with singing your own praises when appropriate and making sure that people are aware of what youre putting out. To promote good content is to waste it. : Never feel bad about promoting content that deserves attention.  With all the crap that exists on the Web, if youve created a wonderful resource for your niche, you should be excited to share it because it may help someone else.  If youre not confident about what youre sharing, ask yourself why.  Could the content be improved? Is your product ready to go live?  If youre not 100 percent in love with what youre doing, then youre not ready to promote it.  Wait until youre over the moon about it.  Then it wont even feel like promotion. Itll just feel like sharing. :  People only mind self-promotion when its not relevant to them.  Its when youre on Twitter and someone wants to sell you their $99.99 eBook on real estate.  Thats annoying because its not a quality product and its not relevant to your needs.  Be sure you only self-promote to people who will be interested.  In my post on , I highlighted some ways to get the attention of reporters in your local area.  Part of that included doing research to understand which reporters cover which niches and the angles they prefer.  Creating a media list for your niche will help you decide who to send what news and how you should package it. : Customers get annoyed if you try to promote you release or publish.  As special as your business is, not everything you do is revolutionary. Not every post needs to be promoted; not every new section on your website needs a full press release.  Make sure youre only promoting content that deserves to be promoted and that you space out your heavy promotional attempts. As long as youre promoting quality content to people who would be interested in it, you shouldnt feel bad about promoting your own content.  As a small business owner, its your job to get the word out about your business and to make sure that the right people know about the product youre offering. As long as its quality and targeted, self-promotion shouldnt be a dirty word. Its just marketing.","As we know, change is the only constant factor. So the answer to, What is eCommerce is always changing. However, experts predict a very promising future for eCommerce in the years to come. In the foreseeable future, eCommerce will be considered the major tool of sale. As e-shopping is becoming more and more widespread, so the sales volume of online stores becomes much higher when compared to brick-and-mortar stores. But what promotes eCommerce changes? It is the efficient and profitable relationship it builds with the consumer and their favorite brands. Undoubtedly, consumer behavior is an important factor in the current eCommerce boom. However, popular eCommerce brands have realized that consumer behavior is not the only ingredient in the online retail formula. Retailers will have to seek to improve eCommerce capabilities by aligning several strategies. The quantity to quality tendency of eCommerce is gradually becoming more prominent in this growing age of globalization. The primary objective below is to reflect the growing eCommerce trend and its impact on the business. Constant innovation and customization of your website will diversify your trade. The trend shows that eCommerce will drive consumers towards alternatives by offering several products and services with attractive schemes to attract online visitors. In addition, users will be more encouraged to leave feedback and suggestions once they are through with their shopping experience. Businesses of any scale should highlight themselves in the market. In this context, eCommerce has the benefit of a new strategy popularly known re-marketing, to in the products and services with repeated exposures. A consumer who sees a commercial that is appealing that they have never seen before actually experiences re-marketing. If a potential customer visits an online shopping website and leaves without purchasing anything, those customers can be tracked on the Internet and the required ads and promotional information can then be shown on the Web pages the customer browses to draw them back. Personalized customer experiences are becoming more popular in their ability to assemble information about the customers. Therefore, they are expecting etailers to deliver one-of kind experiences every time. Research shows that personalization will drive the growth of eCommerce. Single channel experiences are replaced by multi-channel opportunities, thus enabling consumers to enjoy consistent brand experiences through the connection process of their choice. For instance, using a mobile device during an in-store shopping experience. Online merchants should provide similar brand experiences across all touch points, regardless of whether or not the customer is purchasing the products through their smartphone app or on a store shelf or through company websites. This need for cross-channel integration has made retailers ensure that their logistic suppliers are proficient at delivering real-time inventory feeds without sacrificing a steady experience. With the increasing use of , eCommerce has realized the need for mobile integration. From the perspective of the user interface, online businesses will continue to adapt and make the utmost utilization of the different screens of the devices from where they are being accessed.However, there will not be one eCommerce site for a mobile device and another for a desktop. Instead there will be one website which will adapt itself to be viewed in an ideal manner on any screen size, be it a tablet, a 46 inch TV screen, a 24 inch monitor, a mobile device or any other device from which users access websites. The user experience will be the same across all these devices. Scalability and growth go hand-in-hand. Nowadays, retailers are focusing more on creating an eCommerce system that can seize a large section of market share. However, many have ignored the back end of the operation and their fulfillment systems are struggling to keep up. In order to accommodate future development and meet mass expectation, the majority of online retailers proactively assess their ability to quickly scale for higher order volume. Customers become more apprehensive with numerous products and services at their disposal. Moreover, images are not always a convincing tool for customers to judge online products. However, product demonstration videos are becoming popular to address these needs. Social network integration has helped online merchants to share videos via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and many other sites. Social shopping imperatives are continuously evolving. This shopping trend influences retailers to leverage social shopping integration. So far, eCommerce has viewed shipping as a cost of doing business. The importance of fulfillment networks and same-day delivery has been widely addressed. However, most brands have not efficiently invested in the post-transaction experience. This approach might change in the upcoming years. By paying more attention to fulfillment capabilities, brands differentiate themselves through accelerated shipping clubs, delivery programs and many other opportunities. Despite all the bells and whistles, most eCommerce websites are no less than electronic catalogs. Many may lack the human element  those elements that convince you to change your mind. Thus, if there are no surprises and no human touches, the retailer may struggle to maintain a good position in the market. Thus, this attitude is widely changing thanks to dynamic and innovative Web technologies. It is estimated that the cost of acquiring a new customer is 21 times higher than retaining an existing one. To increase customer lifetime value and strengthen Web loyalty, retailers are focusing on packaging and delivery options, thereby making the shopping experience hassle-free to incentivizeit to existing customers. With the right strategies and investments, online retailers can actually transform eCommerce into a greater market share and enhanced growth in sales.","If your small business wants more customer conversions (i.e. sales), then learning when and how to use autoresponders is a step in the right direction. These pre-scheduled emails, usually one or more in a series, are triggered by customer behavior and can be used to target, engage and convert prospects to buyers. An individual autoresponder can even become a standalone product by itself. Though theyve been around for a while, not all small business owners are familiar with the capabilities that autoresponders offer. To help businesses start reaping the benefits, this post provides important definitions, different types of autoresponders and 13 specific examples of how they can be used right away to increase engagement, leads and sales. An ESP is an online vendor that provides email marketing features such as mailing lists, list segmentation, templates, sign-up forms, reporting and autoresponders. Autoresponder features, add-on apps and third-party integrations vary widely between vendors so make sure an ESP meets your business needs before signing up. Some well known ESPs include , and and you . An autoresponder is a series of one or more emails that run on a pre-determined schedule when triggered by a specific customer action. The types of triggers available have evolved over time and deserve a more detailed look. Below, weve described each stage along the evolution of autoresponder triggers and for each, weve included specific business uses and examples for you to explore. One frustrating point to watch out for before we move on  many folks online use the terms ESP, Workflow, Automation and Autoresponder interchangeably or with a different meaning in mind. Be sure to read deeper to discover the differences between these terms before making any specific decisions on types of tools. From the start, autoresponders have been triggered when a customer is added to a specific mailing list, a feature that enables multiple ways to engage and convert. In the above example from , the second email in this autoresponder series has been scheduled to be sent 21 days after the first. You can even specify the exact time the email is sent. The most basic of business uses for autoresponders, a series of personalized emails scheduled out over days or weeks, is the perfect way to welcome your new subscriber. Start providing value right away by including links to specific blog posts, videos and products. Free content will make customers glad that they signed up and theyll be more likely to stay engaged. Include a Sign-Up Discount in your emails and youll increase the odds that theyll become a happy customer. Nothing prepares a customer to buy better than a free taste. If youre a consultant, coach, trainer or any other type of service-oriented business, you can offer a sample course through an autoresponder for free. Each email in the series should provide real value and include the activities and steps recipients can take to learn something or reach a goal. The final email should congratulate your customers on completing the course and offer discounts on your paid offerings. Many ESPs offer the ability to charge a customer before adding them to a mailing list. This is the perfect tool for offering for-pay courses to customers, a logical follow-up to your free courses. The best part of offering a paid autoresponder course is the fact that you only have to set it up once, but it can be sold any number of times. Now thats business value! Third-party integrations and add-on apps kick the usefulness of autoresponders up a notch. While adding a customer to a specific mailing list is still the trigger, you can now use conditional logic to select the list to which a customer should be added. For example, in the image below, if a customer buys a blue bike theyre added to one list. If they buy a red bike, they can be added to another. Its a handy and very effective feature for targeting your customers. An upsell is when you try to increase the value of a specific products sale. For example, if someone buys the blue bike, you can send an email offering a discounted upgrade to a blue bike deluxe product if the customer acts within a predetermined amount of time. A cross-sell is when you try to add a related product to a sale. For example, you can send an email offering the bells that look great on the blue bikes handlebars or an extended product warranty for an additional fee. Product training is always useful and appreciated. Even if its content thats already in a manual, you can create an autoresponder series that highlights important things to know about using the product and links to after-sale content like videos. Personal attention like this is a great way to build customer loyalty and engagement. Your customers will be happy that they purchased a product from you, which makes them far more likely to purchase additional products and recommend your business to their friends and family. Encourage your customers to get the most out of their purchase by emailing a series of useful product use ideas. For example, if you sell a cooking tool, send a series of recipes. If your selling the blue bike weve been talking about, send fun ideas such as organizing a family and friend road rally. Really, the skys the limit here so let your imagination run wild. Supporting positive outcomes from a purchase is another great way to build customer loyalty and engagement and will lead to more sales and referrals. Autoresponders take another leap forward when the trigger moves beyond adding a customer to a specific mailing list. Now it becomes possible to trigger an autoresponder based on time or specific events. Everyone loves to be remembered on their birthday so use an autoresponder to send a discount offer to your customer when their birthday rolls around. Theyll be happy you remembered and more open to making a purchase. Every marketing email you send should contain links back to your products online. When a subscriber clicks on one of those links, you can trigger an autoresponder series with offers related to the products on which they clicked. For example, if someone clicks on a pair of hiking boots, you can send offers for camping equipment, maps, travel books and more. Since they showed interested in a related product, theyre much more likely to make a purchase. If you sell time-based products such as tickets to an event, you can set up an autoresponder that sends helpful suggestions right up to the date. Your emails can include suggestions on what to bring; information on the event venue such as maps, itineraries and menus; and lodging and location information so customers can make the most of their trip. Being useful will increase customer satisfaction and make them more likely to buy from you again. The final stage of trigger evolution (thus far) is the ability to trigger an autoresponder based on events that occur on your own site such as cart abandonment and the type of content or products viewed. Using these types of triggers requires a higher level of investment in both time and money, but the returns can be huge in terms of conversions. Vendors for this type of trigger include companies beyond the standard ESP, specifically those that offer robust marketing automation solutions such as InfusionSoft, Hubspot, and Act-On. In the example above, the autoresponder series begins when someone downloads your free ebook. At this point, the downloader becomes a lead and you can use an autoresponder to provide a series of e-mails with relevant information and offers. Targeted marketing via email is much more effective than e-mails blasted out to your entire list and will increase the likelihood of converting leads to customers significantly. Many times a customer will log into your site and add items to their cart only to leave your site before completing checkout. This is called cart abandonment and the ability to recover these lost sales is valuable indeed. To do so, set up an autoresponder that sends a follow-up email. In the email, ask if they have any questions that would help them decide to complete the sale. Make sure to also offer an alternative method of checking out such as a customer service phone line. This approach has shown significant results for company after company, so its certainly worth exploring for yours. Lastly, an autoresponder can be used to send an email when a customer cancels an order on your site. The email should focus on common reason that cancellations occur and offer solutions and work-arounds for each. Holding your customers hand through this process builds good will and hopefully converts a cancellation back into a sale.","T-Mobile Drake.

That includes your personal credibility, the credibility of your brand, your business, your products and services and of everything else you do. Huge advertising budgets and PR campaigns are not a substitute for credibility. Thats good news for the small business owner who now has a more level playing field when it comes to getting their message out.But it also means spending more time establishing and maintaining your credibility because your business depends upon it. Think of your website as a kind of online handshake. Its a way people instantly assess you and your business. Many people will get their first and most lasting impression of your business from what they find there. This isnt necessarily about your websites design or responsiveness (though those things certainly are important.) Its about the kind of message your website sends about you and your business. The Stanford Web Credibility Research project at Stanfords Persuasive Technology Lab has created these for establishing credibility with your website. They include listing third-party certifications and associations, showing that theres a real organization behind the website, making your website easy to use, allowing people to contact you easily and more. Dont strain your credibility by being willing to sell just anything. The products and services you sell should be those you are willing to put your name and face behind. In fact, in a video presentation, author, hedge-fund manager and entrepreneur James Altucher about the most important thing you as an entrepreneur must learn how to sell, yourself. Consider selling freemium versions of your product to demonstrate the quality to your customers. They can buy enhanced versions of your products and services, if they like what you are offering for free. The most important quality you will need to establish credibility in your personal brand is consistency, Celine Roque at Gigaom. This means making sure that every time you are visible on social media or elsewhere, potential clients and customers see you being exactly what they expect you to be. This can be a lot of hard work, as it turns out. And thats not because of the effort to avoid projecting the wrong image. Much of your time and effort will be spent trying to project the right one. This can include posting consistently on your blog, maintaining a very visible social media presence, possibly writing books, accepting speaking engagements, speaking at conferences and keeping up an aggressive guest blogging schedule. You must do all of this to send a clear message about who you are and what you stand for. Its a necessary part of maintaining credibility in your personal brand. Another reason to avoid selling just anything in your business is that the Internet has made the world transparent.Making the mistake of backing anything even remotely questionable can have a dire impact upon your reputation.Its critical to maintain a good reputation or your business will suffer. Resources that publicly expose questionable products and services are everywhere. So dont get your business anywhere close to any of these. Weve touched upon this above, but several things go into establishing credibility in your social media efforts. To begin with, its helpful to start with an audacious plan of action to . Start with a commitment to take time to build your network, try to make a difference, shine a light on others and work harder on having real conversations. Youll be surprised how much these simple efforts will improve your social media presence in the long run and your brands credibility too.","Some days it feels as though work will never end and, in some respects, it never does.A new study on email habits found that a growing number of workers at small to mid-sized businesses check their email often outside of the regular work day. In fact, the regular work day is quickly changing from the accepted 9-to-5 into something that keeps us somehow on call almost all the time. GFI Software contracted Opinion Matters to find out how often and where . Based on the results, most check their emails routinely outside of the workplace or the regular work time. Of the more than 500 workers who responded to the survey, 81 percent said they check work emails on the weekend and just more than half check their emails after 11 p.m. Even a vacation isnt really a vacation from work these days. Nearly 6 in 10 respondents said theyve checked emails while theyre away from work on vacation. But is there a time when its off limits to check email? Apparently not, according to survey results. Ten percent of respondents said theyve checked work email at a childs school event. About nine percent have done the same at a wedding and six percent have checked their inboxes during a funeral. Wife in labor? No matter. Six percent said theyve checked email then, too. The rise in use of smartphones has contributed greatly to the availability of emails. And despite the fact that newer and sometimes more efficient means of communicating are available  like instant messaging or the old-fashioned telephone email is the preferred means of business communications for small to mid-sized firms. Forty-four percent of respondents said they used email more than the phone and instant messaging combined.","The site where you can get a tiny crocheted Maltese puppy, a glowing turquoise owl necklace, and a 3D paper taxidermy lion can now be yours. Well, at least part of it. Etsy, headed by CEO Chad Dickerson (pictured above), went public today April 16. Shares of the company are being offered for $16 each as part of Etsys Initial Public Offering (IPO). The IPO is expected to last until April 21. A company (PDF) says that 16,666,666 shares of Etsy common stock are available. The company will be selling 13,333,333 shares while existing stockholders are selling the remainder. Etsy does not receive any money from the sale of stock by stockholders, just its own shares. ZdNet that based on Etsys initial pricing, the company has a valuation of $1.8 billion. The company reported $195.6 million in revenue in 2014. Etsy will be traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ETSY. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. Allen & Company LLC, Loop Capital Markets LLC and The Williams Capital Group, L.P. are acting as co-managers, according to a company release. This IPO has been met with particular skepticism since it was a few months ago. Most notable among those concerns is that Etsy is growing but is still not profitable. The company ackowledges operating at a net loss of $15.2 million for 2014, $0.8 million for 2013 and $2.4 million for 2012. By the end of 2014, the company says it had accumulated a deficit of $32.4 million. In its Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the company further : A from MarketWatch suggests that two factors may prevent Etsy from being profitable longterm. First, its the largest B-Corp company to go through an IPO. B-Corp companies must meet certain criteria  social and environmental responsibilities among them  as judged by the B Lab, a non-profit company that gives out B-Corp certifications. Meeting these criteria can be costly and cut into any potential profits. And as Etsy continues to grow, costs associated with maintaining B-Corp status will continue to grow, too. Secondly, Etsy has made a commitment to its sellers. After all, without sellers and the fees they pay on each completed transaction, Etsy wouldnt make any money. To stay dedicated to the seller first (in this case, the stakeholder) over the shareholder, the company will have to keep those fees low. Further, Etsy sellers have become concerned in recent years with rule changes to the communitys guidelines that would seem to allow so-called resellers of mass produced products on the site. In 2013, the company again opted for policy changes it hoped would appease its large handmade community while at the same time allowing it to broaden its user-base by accommodating more kinds of sellers. The new policy seemed to continue to allow the sale of products created by outsourced labor so long as sellers were transparent about the process. Specifically, : It went on to say: It has been a rapid rise for Etsy. The company was started in 2005 in Brooklyn, New York. And its site was designed as a platform for makers of handmade goods specifically, to sell their products. At last count, the site has 1.4 million active sellers. Etsy says there are 19.8 million active buyers, too.","The playing field may be leveling for small independent musicians who, up until now, had difficulty earning money from their music when used on websites like YouTube. Major record companies and music publishers already have agreements with YouTube to get paid when their songs are featured in videos posted by users, . Now a small startup called says it can do the same for the small independents. Audiam launched overseas last month and should be available to independent musicians in the U.S. by the end of July, Bloomberg Businessweek reported. The company says its service is free for artists. Once a musician signs up for an account and uploads their music to the site, Audiam begins scouring YouTube for videos that utilize their music. According to the FAQ page on its website, once Audiam has found the artists songs on YouTube, the company authorizes text ads or commercials to be placed on the videos and collects revenues on the artists behalf. Signing up for the service means an artist is allowing Audiam to represent them in the pursuit of revenue for their music on YouTube videos for one year. The agreement renews unless cancelled. Every time a YouTube user clicks on an ad or watches at least 30 seconds of a commercial on an Audiam clients video, the company will collect money from YouTube. Audiam takes a 25 percent cut from the revenue it collects for its artists for the service it provides and artists retain all rights to their work. The service provides a potential alternative for small independent musicians who might not be able to earn sufficient revenue selling recordings via iTunes or Amazon.",", who goes by on Twitter, is not your average BlogWorld speaker. He doesnt run a social media agency. He doesnt run a marketing agency. He runs a pool company. In Virginia. And yet, his pool company is one of the most popular in the search engines, in the world. After the economic slump in 2008, he found selling pools hard. He turned to writing a blog, and saw great results within 6 months. Now his pool blog gets hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. He is truly, as in the example he gave in his session at this weeks in Los Angeles, a David to the Goliaths in his industry. Sheridan gave attendees seven blog topics to write about. Essentially, he said: The first topics he covered were cost and price. When he asked the audience how many people talked about price on their websites, only two raised their hands. He asked why we didnt list our prices. most of us are afraid to talk about price. We want to talk about value. But hes found that by mentioning price on his pool site, more people buy from him, simply because hes not afraid of the conversation. He also suggests writing about problems. Customers have problems with products in your industry (maybe even yours). They have problems that your products can solve. Write about them. Sheridan also suggests using negative keywords as a way to draw in people looking for bad reviews, such as product X bad review. Even if the product isnt yours, its a way to introduce them to yours if there are bad reviews about a competitors product. Sheridan suggests comparing or contrasting products. His Product A vs. Product B posts have been among the most visited posts on his blog. He also suggests creating awards for your industry, even if it means highlighting competitors products. The trick here is that in adding a Goliath to your award list and linking to them, theyll become aware of the honor and link back to your site, thus giving you some great Google juice! Genius. Finally, Sheridan says that breaking news is another great topic for your blog for driving traffic. The more niche your industry, the fewer people will be covering the smaller news stories, so your blog could be a valuable resource for that information.","Yahoos Marissa Mayer unleashed a firestorm of commentary throughout the business world with her recent announcement that remote working was off the table for the tech companys staffers, who will now be expected to show up in the office every day. The move goes against the grain at a time when everybody from the federal government to tech startups is embracing the flexibility and cost savings of working remotely. As someone who initiated working remotly for my team back when I was an employee, Ive got a lot of experience with what works  and what doesnt. At bottom, the work-at-home issue all comes down to trust. In a recent Regus poll of more than 24,000 global workers, a whopping 88 percent say that , and 85 percent feel their bosses need to show more trust in remote employees. Of course, Regus, which provides flexible workspaces, has a vested interest in the growth of remote work. But its survey points out a disconnect between how managers and employees view remote work. While managers are more likely (79 percent) to view employees who get to the office early and stay late as hardworking, employees dont feel the same. Just 54 percent believe these individuals are hardworking. If youve worked in an office for more than a day, you know there are just as many ways to goof off when youre at your desk as there are when youre at home. Face time doesnt equal productivity, and the focus and concentration boost from working remotely can allow people (at least some people) to get more done. Regus also found that younger employees have made flexible work more mainstream, which should serve as a warning that if your business plans to be around for more than the next five or 10 years  youd better meet halfway as to how they want to work. If youve still got a nagging feeling that letting employees work at home means paying them to watch Cartoon Network in their jammies all day, how can you get over it? Here are some trust building tactics that worked for me when it came to working remotely. I always let my team know that working remotely is a privilege, not a right. While everyone had the same right to try working from home, not everyone earned the privilege to keep doing it. Employees needed to show results. Set goals, quotas or whatever measurements work for your business, and make sure staffers are meeting them. Im not saying your whole team has to go virtual and begin working remotely. You set the rules, so if you want to limit work-at-home to Tuesdays or every other Friday, go ahead and do it. That way, you know everyone will be in the office on certain days, making it easier to plan meetings and events. Working remotely may not be a fit in your business, so set a trial period to see how it works out. Im guessing your team will be highly motivated to prove it can work, so you may see huge spurts in productivity. Do you want all remote employees checking in via Google Hangouts for a 10-minute morning meeting? How quickly do you expect them to answer their phones or IMs? How detailed do they have to be in letting you know where they are at any given moment (do they need to IM you when they head to the restroom)? Set control levels that make you comfortable. When people are out of the office, its more important than ever for you to be plugged in. Pay attention to the buzz among your employees. If some people feel the program isnt working out, ask why  then deal with the problem. Perceived unfairness can poison your businesss morale. Its my experience that slackers will be slackers whether theyre in the office or not. Hard workers will do their best no matter whether theyre on the couch at home or perched at an Aeron chair in your office. Show your team a little trust, and theyll pay you back in spades.","I keep thinking that its only a matter of time before my trips to the mall start resembling Tom Cruises experience in his movie .

Hamilton  who were collaborating on a paper about how to detect when corporate polluters were under-reporting what is actually coming out of their smokestacks. But something unexpected came out of their work, an observation about the different ways each of us approach decision-making. And this is what made this book interesting. While books like   and   talk about how people make choices, they dont really get into what drives different people to have such different styles of decision making. But in Hamilton and de Marchi discuss the six core traits that shape our decisions.The six TRAITS attributes are: In order to really appreciate these traits, the authors have created a series of questions where you can do a self-assessment of your decision-making.  If youd like to get a flavor of whats in this book, Ive set up a survey using QuestionPro, to let you take the self-assessment test that appears in the book. Your responses to the survey are completely anonymous.  You do not need to identify yourself in any way. This is just for your own knowledge. Start the survey to self-assess your decision-making profile here: . At the end of each set of 5 questions, you will be re-directed to a spotlight report where you can see how your answers compare with other readers answers. Be sure to scroll down to the bottom of each report page to see your overall score for each attribute. You might want to print or save each spotlight report page for future reference. If you have problems, you can take each of the TRAITS profiles separately: , , , INFORMATION, , .

You Are What You Choose was one of these newly-released books I thought youd be interested in. I recommend for anyone who is involved in sales and marketing  no matter what size business you work in.  You will not only get a better idea of what motivates buying decisions, youll be able to better structure your marketing message to attract more ideal customers.","For the actor who celebrates the spirit of entrepreneurship and believes in taking calculated risk , stocks , land and gold remain preferred investment avenues. Rashmi Menon of ET finds out what percentage of investment Leone spends on stocks and gold. ET: What does money mean to you? Sunny Leone: Money makes the world go round.It's part of our lives, how we function and how we move forward and are able to do all the things that we want to do. I came from a family that didn't have a lot of money. I saw the struggle of my parents and learnt a lot from my father. ET: What's the best advice you have ever been given, or read? Sunny Leone: It was from my parents. They always advised me to be independent and live on my own. You have to do everything on your own and cannot count on anyone. I think, it was one of the best pieces of advice I got. ET: How would you describe yourself -a risk taker or cautious person-when spending money? Sunny Leone: Calculated and a control freak. A lot of my business investments -mutual funds, stocks or even Lust (Leone's deo and perfume line) -are all very calculated. I am a control freak so , everything is very calculated. There is obviously risktaking involved but it's a calculated risk. ET: What would count as your first investment? Who did it for you? Sunny Leone: I started my own business in entertainment when I was 18 and the investment was in me, my own brand. Everything I was making, I was putting it back into my company.I taught myself HTML, how to build a website, built first affiliate programme, editing photos, etc. That cost money and a lot of time. So, that was my first real big investment.I also spent a lot of time going to different webmaster conventions, learning about traffic, the industry and different things I could do on my own. ET: What did you do with your first salary? Sunny Leone: I spent it on candies, I think. It was the money I saved by putting up lemonade stands in the summer and shovelling snow in the winter when I was seven or nine years old. But the first big purchase I made, however, was buying a tape cassette of Salt-NPepa without my parents' permission when I was 13. Things they talked about were very intriguing for me then. It was around $9-$20. ET: Gold, land, stocks. In which order would you invest in them and why? What is the percentage that you have invested in each? Sunny Leone: I would say 40% in stocks and 30% each in land and gold. Majority of our investments are in mutual funds and stocks in the US. I am still trying to figure out my way here. It's not easy to invest in India . Real estate is always a safe investment and with gold, we prefer gold bonds rather than buying physical gold. ET: What are the investments you have blind faith in? Why? Sunny Leone: We have put an amount of money in IRA (Individual Retirement Account) and other safe investments in the US.We also have a certain percentage that our broker has invested in all these certain things. Interestingly, during Brexit , we lost some money.We didn't think we were going to be affected by it but few things we invested in, lost money. It will go back up eventually.Another investment I have blind faith in is my ranch style 5,000-sq feet home in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles.I have spent a lot of money fixing it. If I ever have to sell it, I know I will make money on it. ET: Do you have substantial health insurance coverage? Sunny Leone: Yes, we spend a lot of money on health coverage -Obamacare and private insurance -in the US. In India, the healthcare is amazing. Here, I call the doctor and he will make house calls and actually cares about my well being. ET: What about life insurance plans? Sunny Leone: In the US, it's mandatory to insure everything. So, we have home insurance, earthquake insurance and car insurance. In India, we have car insurance for our BMW 7 series car. ET: Any pension and retirement plans that you hope to fall back on? Sunny Leone: We have IRAs in the US. So, we have our retirement plans. If I wasn't in this industry and wasn't fortunate enough to be successful, and if I were to cash in my retirement, I wonder where it would have gotten me? It's next to nothing.But we have so many different investments that I believe if Bollywood ended today, these other investments will be able to sustain the lifestyle and growth, but in a different direction. ET: One moneyed person you would like to spend time with at a table-fortwo. Sunny Leone: Jessica Simpson. I love her business model. She took her brand that was big and all of a sudden invested in her own shoe line. From shoes it expanded to clothes and other things and she now owns a multi-million dollar company.As a woman and someone in entertainment, that's someone I would look up to and say you have done an amazing job. ET: Fill in the blanks. Money cannot buy happiness but it can.... Sunny Leone: buy a nice house. You can be unhappy in your house or try to be happy in your new house.","We understand running your business may take 40, 50 or 60 hours a week  and then some.To save your valuable time, the Small Business Trends editorial team has gathered this recap of key stories not to miss this week.

Indie books are now on a similar footing as books published by larger traditional publishers, when it comes to the opportunity to get in front of brick and mortar bookstores. Best-selling author Kristine Rusch, who also has owned a publishing business and a book distribution startuop, on her website. She says its a recent change. Bookstores now have access through Baker & Taylor, to all published print books, whether via Amazons Createspace (for self-published authors) or large traditional publishers. The changes have to do with Baker & Taylor, one of the major book distributors, changing its policies. Earlier this year, she says, Baker & Taylor made the terms of discounts and returns for print on demand (POD) books by self-published authors, more favorable for bookstores. Also, POD books are now mixed in with traditionally published books, instead of being segregated, on Baker & Taylors lists, Rusch notes. In the past, self-published authors were at a disadvantage. Their discount/returns policy was less favorable from a booksellers perspective, than traditionally published books.

Its the business end. I get a bit fascinated by musicians, and how they attempt to balance artistic statement with being accessible to the public  another way of saying, Gimme enough sales so I can continue my artistic statements. At least that was the thesis for the music business of yore. Without a doubt, the Internet and digitizing the music format has reshaped how music artists garner fans.

A viable business model underscores her fame, a model with tactics that small businesses could adopt on a smaller scale. Author Jackie Huba ( ) examines Gagas model in her book I was intrigued by how the book came about  a blog post on Lady Gaga garnered the most replies on the authors blog. So I downloaded a NetGalley copy for review. Lady Gagas career history is as extensive as a 27 year old singers can be. Despite her first singles having achieved 6 number one hits  a record  Lady Gaga does not have a storied musicianship like, say, the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson or Madonna, an artist she is regularly compared to. So those artists may have more material for an author to research and draw business concepts from. But the context Huba sets for is worth the study. Lady Gagas success is examined against a social media and digital marketing landscape in which the target audience must be constantly engaged and immersed in an experience. It is a different audience landscape from the one in the heydays of Madonna, Michael Jackson, the Rolling Stones and others.  Small business owners are more likely to identify with Madonna than Lady Gaga, but reading teaches a different spin on the value of social media  one that does not require a discussion about a tweet or like. Take the first chapter of the book, for example. It examines the value of the one percenters  that core audience that responds to your product. The one percenters are your superfans  the Little Monsters as she calls them. Lady Gaga spends nearly all of her effort on this highly engaged fan base. In other words, your marketing should be on those who are responding the most to your product or service. Huba notes this philosophy against 2011 research by Forrester showing most marketers are focused on new customers, not existing ones, and certainly not on such a tiny group as the one percenters: With such a deliberate focus on addressing her fan base, you might conclude that Lady Gaga is a manipulator. But she doesnt come across that way in the book. Instead she just comes across as someone who knows on which side her bread is buttered. When it comes to her fans, Lady Gaga believes: Lady Gagas viewpoint could fit into Gary Vaynerchuks quite easily. That is the point of business books written about famous people  to learn more than leadership from sources seemingly disparate from your own past experiences. Huba deftly enhances her points with a mix of business data and highlights from Gagas career. For example Lady Gaga understands her one percenters  her devoted fans. The book reveals how Gaga developed her own community network. The suggestions may seem out of reach for the small business owner. Yet a small business owner can learn the value of Lady Gagas choices. In Vaynerchuk refers to the context of relationship and how your brand must improvise and be willing to go where the consumer leads you. In Gaga demonstrates that improvisation, built on the context before her. She may have certainly had the money to build a social networking platform of her own, but the structure of the idea can be emulated through similar, affordable platforms that you learn about everyday on . Business tools alone do not guarantee success. Its how those tools are applied to make a sustainable business model. If you read you will learn the right attitude to apply to the numerous digital marketing strategies touted every day. It will be the winning attitude that will take your business to the next level.","Its no surprise that companies of all sizes flock to Twitters 271 million monthly active users to get closer to their customers. But while of brands have a dedicated customer support handle, only 10 percent of brands address more than 70 percent of their mentions. Thats a lot of opportunity left on the table. Of course, some tweets might not merit a response. But every customer who reaches out to a brand should receive an acknowledgement. The problem is that when companies are faced with Twitters pressure for constant activity and engagement, they feel torn between engagement and customer service on Twitter. But the answer is simple: Twitter is best at both  but separately. An effective Twitter strategy meets two fundamental customer relationship needs: But why tangle these two functions together when it makes more sense to streamline your efforts and separate your Twitter accounts by these roles? The ability to listen to your customers through Twitters keyword monitoring function is one of the platforms most exciting tools. With this tool, a customer service representative can provide helpful information or a direct phone number to alleviate a customers aversion to faceless support teams. and are great examples of brands that prioritize responsiveness and excellent customer support through Twitter. These brands tweet constantly throughout the day. Sometimes even in a second language. While listening is important, it only represents half of your social strategys potential. To tap into that other half and take advantage of sales opportunities, you must actively engage your customers. Dont simply listen for mentions of your brand that you can react to. Target key phrases that indicate intent to purchase. A perfect example of this opportunity lies in something as simple as a food craving. Heres how a local Papa Johns franchise responded when a Texas resident expressed a need for wings: Rather than waiting for someone to tweet about Papa Johns, the company sought out customers ready to buy, responded with an incentive and created its own opportunity. Separating your Twitter handles allows your support team to divide and conquer. With distinct goals and resources, each team has access to a streamlined, focused workload with clearly defined roles. This separation also makes it easier for customers to engage the appropriate support personnel without having to sort through a high-touch customer service system. To better serve your customers, its time to reorganize your Twitter strategy. Heres how to balance your strategy between the passive and active functions of listening and engaging: Appoint one employee to monitor for customer service issues and another to proactively engage with possible customers. Comcast is a great example of a company that accomplishes this. Its Twitter team is divided into three layers of service: As social media networks grow and flourish, so do software applications. Encourage your team to use these tools to monitor and engage with customers on Twitter rather than manually track them down. Do your research. Identify the tools that will help you respond as quickly and pleasantly as possible. When you segment your Twitter teams, dont make the mistake of also segmenting your brands voice. Establishing brand guidelines, including acceptable response times, phrases and tones for each department will keep your tone consistent across all levels of service. For many companies, separate customer service and engagement accounts simply arent within the budget. However, that doesnt mean youre stuck with a silent Twitter strategy. Instead of dividing your team, try dividing your team members time. For example, during your busy times, you can feature and retweet social proof comments like did. During your slow times, you can respond to personal and engaging comments, like this church did when a user . Use the available technology and search functions to make sure you dont miss support questions on the main channel. Keep in mind that some users simply mention the brand name and still expect an answer. So make sure you search for your company name without the handle. Not staying on top of these comments can lead to a worst-case scenario in which your customers resent not being acknowledged. As noted social media and technology speaker says, Social media is more about psychology and sociology than technology. If your company is too excited by Twitters potential for activity and engagement to focus on what its doing, youll only end up confusing your customers. Instead, make the most of your companys Twitter presence by tapping into your customers need for responsive customer support, and your businesss need for proactive marketing and sales,by addressing each area separately.","As your company grows, you add more processes, software, and people. If you havent been proactively streamlining all along, you may be surprised to find that your systems are complicated and redundant. Consolidating workflow will help your growing business continue to flourish and keep your people working on the important stuff. If youre entering the same data in multiple places, youre wasting your time. Software app integration lets you enter data one time and sync it in other places automatically. A huge timesaver? Look for customer relationship management (CRM) software that offers app integration with other services, such as email marketing, accounting, and content management. For example, Insightly with Evernote, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, , Outlook 2013, , , and . Soon, Insightly will also integrate with . Integration allows you to more efficiently manage tasks within your CRM without duplicating work, such as linking project information from Evernote to an organization in your CRM, or creating personalized quotes with CRM information via Quote Roller. The days of being unable to work on a project because data is stored on a desktop you cant access are over. Now everyone on your team, your clients and anyone else who needs to collaborate on a project or document, is able to see and use important information from any place via the Internet. Data stored in the cloud is due to computer glitches because its not stored on any one individuals computer. Be aware that when some cloud apps have unexpected downtime, it could affect your ability to work. (Was your business affected when in March?) If youre worried about downtime issues, consider combination apps that allow you to work from backup data stored locally, or those that have offline mode. Popular cloud apps for business include , , , and RebitPro. In addition, many cloud apps are lower cost alternatives to purchasing a block of software licenses for your company. Few things are more frustrating than missing a deadline because someone was checking the wrong calendar. The best way to avoid this is by using just one calendar for everyone and every project. Choose a calendar that will integrate with the software you use for CRM and project management, plus the mobile devices your team regularly uses. Not only will you be able to sync important project deadlines, but your team can manage their own schedules within the same mobile app while keeping on top of important company deadlines. Just like you learned in school, Keep It Simple, Silly. If you want to avoid complicating routine business tasks and creating redundancy in your workflow, always focus on simplicity. The latest technology doesnt always improve upon what youve already got in place. If you are shopping for better business systems, be sure you arent duplicating something you already have. This is one place where plugins, apps, and extensions are really helpful. You can find software, such as CRM or a Web browser, that does one thing really well. Then perhaps add a plugin that a process or adds functionality youve been managing with a uni-tasking piece of software. That frees you and your team up from one more program and one more process to learn. If youve been neglecting streamlining your business systems, the first time you take a hard look at the options could be a little overwhelming. Once you take the time to find the right apps for the jobs you need automated and eradicate any redundant systems and software, youll be empowered to regularly assess your systems, making the upkeep much simpler going forward. Possibly the best payment for streamlining systems is freeing up your team to work on projects  rather than burning time doing redundant tasks.","When a Louisiana teacher visited her local Starbucks, she didnt expect that her coffee drinks would deliver a satanic message. But when she looked down at the two drinks, she allegedly saw just that. One of them depicted a star that appeared to be Lucifers pentagram and the other included a 666 made with caramel drizzle. Megan K. Pinion posted a photo to the coffee chains Facebook page with the following comments: In addition to her post on Facebook, Pinion also filed a formal complaint with Starbucks. The company has since apologized to Pinion, a public school teacher who is of Catholic faith. But it hasnt commented on whether or not the employee responsible for the artwork would be disciplined. Tom Kuhn, a Starbucks spokesman, : What should the appropriate response of the business be in this situation? Starbucks apologized. Should they have done more? A sincere apology is nice, but isnt always good enough when a customer receives poor service or is offended by an employee. In this case, Pinion likely wasnt the only one offended. Countless other Starbucks customers saw the post on Facebook and likely came to their own conclusions about the incident and how the company should have reacted. Firing or otherwise disciplining the employee responsible for the artwork would be one option. But Starbucks said it is their policy to not publicly discuss such actions, and Pinion wasnt able to provide the company with the employees name. Another option would be to compensate Pinion in some way for the unsatisfactory service she received. The company has issued gift cards to apologize for service issues at franchise locations.","Imagine that you woke up one day and had been endowed with the power to see hidden profits for your business. You would wake up on this particular day and as you padded around for that first cup of coffee, youd see a few dollars peeking around the coffee maker.  Youd open up your computer and a ten dollar bill would be wedged between the screen and keyboard.  Youd sit down to write something and pop right back up again because you actually sat on a pile of quarters, nickels and dimes. Everywhere you looked and walked  everything you touched  was spilling out money. This money could be yours.  But it isnt  because you havent for it.  It is money that still belongs to your customer because you havent created the opportunity for them to give it to you. Every business has hidden profits.  And are those little piles of money that we cant see because were not yet endowed with the power of seeing them.  The good news is that all of us can learn to start seeing these opportunities for increasing our profits.  Rafi Mohammeds book   can help you do just that. Pricing is powerful stuff and its a shame that its often the most ignored component of the marketing mix.  Granted, its not quite as sexy as a pretty ad campaign.  But advertising costs money  and a good pricing strategy can actually MAKE you money.  So where would you rather put your time? Lets get to the meat of this book. The biggest lesson Rafi teaches us is that setting a profit-building pricing strategy starts in YOUR HEAD. The first step is understanding what you offer that your customers value.  For example, if youre walking through a big city like Washington D.C. or New York on a sunny day, youll see lots of vendors selling T-shirts and souvenirs and umbrellas.  He says, So, at the first hint of rain, street vendors double their prices of umbrellas. The second key to finding hidden profits is to make it easy for your customers to choose you (translation: give you money) by giving them a variety of price levels and offering levels to choose from. A great example of different price levels to offer customers and one that Rafi gives in the book is the story about his buddy Dave, the restaurateur.   Dave wanted to grow his customer base beyond high-spending foodies.   Take a look at this example from the book.  Daves original question was should I charge $18 or $31 for a dinner?  Heres what Rafi writes: All that instead of charging either $18 or $31!  Who knew that so much creativity could be included in pricing a restaurant meal? Sometimes we as business owners have a hard time understanding the value we bring to the table. I often see business owners (especially new business owners) under-price. We are often the worst  judge of the value we provide. To cut through the temptation to price too low, and understand the true value of what you offer, Rafi suggests a value-decoder process.  This process walks you through 5 steps to nail down a core price that you can work from to build offerings that will deliver more profit.  You can find an on Rafis website. This is one of my favorite pricing books  and I think it will be yours too for this one reason: its written in plain simple English.  It contains several process lists and strategies that you can actually read about and implement today. One caveat, however: while this book isnt heavy on the math component  that doesnt mean that you can wing or swag your way through the strategy.  I cant stress enough how important it is for you to have a grasp on your costs.  How much does it cost your business to exist?  How much does it cost you to fill an order?  What is your customer net worth?  Dont attempt any of these strategies without knowing and understanding your costs and loss leaders. This book is an excellent read for business owners, marketers and anyone who has responsibility for and can implement pricing strategy for their business. Finally, Id like to refer you to more information.  First, there is the of Rafi Mohammed that I co-hosted on Small Business Trends Radio.  Youll hear directly from Rafi with more insights. Second, Id like to refer you to my companion article  .  You may pick up a few tips for setting your prices, using psychology.","The Q2 earnings season is about to come to a close, and some lined up this week Tuesday, August 8 Clear Channel Communications","What is a database? A database is an organized collection of information. Small businesses can use databases in a number of different ways. A database can help you organize information about your customers and clients. A database can contain information about your product inventory. A database can track sales, expenses and other financial information. The purpose of a database is to help your business stay organized and keep information easily accessible, so that you can use it. But it isnt a magic solution to all your data concerns. First, you need to collect and input the data into a database. Second, you need to organize and extract information from a database so that it is usable. For that you typically need a software program to help organize data, extract it, move it, and use it. A lot of small businesses are heavy users of Microsoft Excel or Google spreadsheets. A spreadsheet may seem similar to a database. But a spreadsheet is not nearly as powerful as a database for large volumes of information. Also, getting information into and out of spreadsheets can be clunky. You may have to do a lot of manual data entry, or manually exporting and importing data to other programs. And you cant easily manipulate spreadsheet data  i.e., analyze it, move it into other applications, or run reports with it. Databases can make your organization much more efficient and give management valuable insights. They help make sense of your information. They can help you make your products and services more valuable. They can helpyou sell more. For example, if you own an online store, you could use a database for your website to keep track of customer data, purchases, prices, and other information. This can be transferred directly into your accounting system  saving you the time to collect the data, find the corresponding spreadsheet, and input the data yourself. With sophisticated software, this data could be used on the fly to make suggestions for additional purchases. The data can also help you manage inventory levels, to know when inventory is getting low or when something is out of stock. For small business owners and non-IT staff, databases really need to be wrapped up in a software program to be useful. Unless we are in technology roles, most of us wont be coding and tapping directly into a MySQL database. You use databases all the time and may not realize it. Online software services we use today have some kind of database built into them. An accounting software program or an ecommerce application, will have a database inside it. Thats great if you need a standard accounting program or ecommerce store. But what about the parts of your business with unique workflows? Or processes that are unique to your business? Thats where non-technical database applications come in today. With one of the business-friendly databases (sometimes called desktop databases), you can set up and customize a database specific to your businessand your workflow  and you dont need to be a coder. is one. is another that is reasonably friendly for non-IT staff, and you can even use it to create mobile apps. is a third popular choice, and its especially popular for Mac, iPhone and iPad. These kinds of business-friendly databases can be used to house, track and use data that you might not find an off-the-shelf software program to do. You can use them tocreate customized executive dashboards. But you dont have to hire a software developer. Using a desktop database application is like developing custom software applications for your business, without the complexity and programming expense.","Small business lending at big banks ended the year strong. But loans at small banks continued to decline, the December 2014 Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index shows. If you look at the index for the final month of 2014 one way, youd see approval of small business loans at big banks continues to increase. According to , big banks approved 21.1 percent of the loan requests they received from small businesses last month. Thats up from 20.8 percent in November. Thats the second straight month of increase since October, and part of a steadily upward trend for most of the year. In fact, for small business loan approval at big banks in seven months. And compared with 2013, at the same time, small business loans are being approved 20 percent more often by big banks. So 2014, on the whole, seems to have been a good year for small businesses seeking capital from banks to grow. But if you look at the numbers another way, youd see that this increase is only telling part of the story. Its a story of success mainly for small businesses seeking big money from big banks. In a statement accompanying the release of the December 2014 index, Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora : But smaller companies and startups are less likely to need as much money and thus less likely to find this option attractive, Arora said. And small banks arent likely to be a good alternative. There lending trends have continued to be negative, the Biz2Credit Index notes. For a second straight month, small businesses were denied loans at small banks more often than they were approved. Small banks only approved 49.7 percent of those requests from small businesses in December. Thats down from the 49.8 loan approval rate by small banks in November and marks the seventh straight month of decline. Though the approval rate is still a percentage point higher than it was in December 2013. Still, other options continue to present themselves for small business owners. For example, institutional lenders, a new category for the index, saw a 60.1 percent approval rate for small business loans in December. Thats up from 59.9 percent in the previous month. The category has seen a steady increase since Biz2Credit started monitoring in January 2014. Arora ads: By contrast, other lenders have not fared as well. Alternative lenders like merchant cash advance companies, factors, and other non-bank institutions continued to see declines. Approval rates for these lenders hit 61.8 percent in December, the twelfth straight month of decline. Arora observes: Credit unions also saw a drop in December, approving 43.3 percent of small business loan applications down from 43.4 percent in December. Biz2Credit creates its monthly index by analyzing data from more than 1000 small business owners who applied for loans between $25,000 and $3 million on its online lending platform.","Google AdWords can already track the connection between your customers click on an ad and a sale on your website.But a new feature called AdWords Conversion Import can track clicks on an AdWords link right on through to a sale in the offline world. Imagine a series of Google AdWords links leading to a landing page on your site where prospects can leave contact information requesting more information on your product or service. By adding code provided through Google AdWords Conversion Import to your website, Google lets you collect click identifiers designating a click on a specific ad and the day and time of that click. Those identifiers can then be matched with the contact information of a specific prospect left on your website. You can place the contact information and the Google code into your customer relationship management software. If the contact information leads to a sale, a qualified lead or whatever other desired result you wish to track, you can place the imported click identifier code back into Google AdWords. The feature will allow Google to provide detailed reporting on these offline sales and other activities as a result. Google says the AdWords Conversion Import could be used to track other more indirect online sales too. For example, you could use it to report conversions 30 days after a sale to give customers time to make returns. You could record only first time buyers on your site or only second time buyers. This video gives another view of the new Google AdWords Conversion Import feature:","An organized business is a productive business. You may not consider yourself blessed with natural organizational skills, but now is the perfect time to get your business and work space organized. Below are 10 tips to help you do that and get on track in the new year. Even if you dont mind a little mess and dust, too much clutter can add to daily stress and chaos. Clutter exists because we think that everything is important. With the new year, toss out whatever is outdated, no longer relevant or a duplicate. For example: When your workspace is clean and uncluttered, youll enjoy spending time at your desk and wont waste time searching through junk or moving piles around. One found that the average person wastes over 4 hours per week searching for papers. Go through your filing cabinets and shred anything thats out of date or no longer relevant to your business. If youre worried you might one day need four-year old notes from a client project, then scan the originals and throw out the paper files to make more room. Considering the IRS accepts electronic copies of receipts, theres really no reason for you to continue hanging on to all those tiny paper slips from restaurants, taxis, office supply stores, etc. Find a receipt management scanner or app for your smartphone (such as Neat Receipts) and make sure your solution lets you export data to whatever expense reporting/accounting app you use. If you havent done so already, start using cloud-based tools to share and save documents. For example, lets you store up to 15GB for free, while giving clients or colleagues access to collaborate. Other tools include and . By housing files in the cloud, you can help clean up your personal storage, as well as save valuable time spent emailing documents back and forth when collaborating with others. If your email inbox has become a catchall for every email youve received over the past years, its time to clean house. It is possible to manage your email inbox so you only see the messages you still need to deal with and everything else is neatly archived for safe keeping. Start with a clean slate by filing away everything you no longer need to respond to. Next, tame the level of new emails you get each day by unsubscribing to newsletters or other subscriptions you no longer read. Create specific folders where non-essential emails go automatically, so they dont interrupt your daily flow. One key to staying organized and effective as a small business owner is having the right solution for jotting down any tasks or inspirations when they strike. Whether you prefer to use pen and paper, voice recording on your smartphone or an app like , the most important thing is that the solution fits into your lifestyle so youll use it consistently. Its not just your email inbox and desktop that fall prey to clutter. Your social media profiles can also become clogged and out of date. First, take stock of where your business has a social presence and drop any accounts that are no longer in use. Theres no point in having multiple Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr and Instagram profiles if youre not actively posting and monitoring each account. You can also use a tool like to weed out any followers who are inactive or arent following you back. Dont wait until its time to file your returns to start thinking about taxes. Make an appointment with a CPA or tax advisor early in the year. If your business is still structured as a sole proprietor, nows the time to think about protecting your personal assets and gaining other benefits through a formal business structure . If you run a small business, you already have some kind of process in place for invoicing, processing payments, recording expenses and tracking projects. But if you havent updated your process lately, chances are theres an app out there to help make these administrative tasks easier and more efficient. Take a look at your tablet/smartphone app store for a new tool that could help you get organized and take charge of your books in the new year. For example, theres , , , and to name a few. This is a perfect opportunity to tie up any loose ends youve been putting off in prior years. For example, did you file a for your business name? Did you get a Tax ID number? Are all your licenses and local permits in order? Did you make any changes to your corporation and LLC and still need to file an Articles of Amendment to record those changes with the state? What other tips can you offer to get your business organized this year?","This column is by Career Coach & Blogger Christopher Connors Each day, whether we realize it or not, we endeavor to compete for something; the affection or love of a partner, a promotion in the workplace or, with ourselves, to become a bigger, bolder and better people. Herein, I provide 8 steps on how you can compete every day to live a fulfilling life. As you read these steps, visualize and imagine your personal definition of success. Think about how your definition of success jives with these steps. Determine whether you are already incorporating them into your daily routine- or if you can begin introducing them into your day. Most importantly, find what works for you, stick to it and develop consistency. Im glad that no one keeps a tally of the number of unsuccessful days Ive lived. Days where Ive been lazy, procrastinated and frittered the hours away. Frankly, Im willing to bet we could all agree to that. What I can tell you is, the unsuccessful days have mostly been the ones that I did not plan. As I have grown over the years in my professional career, I have dramatically reduced those unsuccessful days by following one simple step: I have planned my day the previous night. Im not suggesting that you plan out every minute or even every hour of your day. I always recommend that you leave some space for creativity and the unknown. In budget terms, that would be called, contingency. That contingency time has proved invaluable for me throughout my life, both on a personal and professional basis. Personally, it has permitted me time to attend doctor visits for my son and plan impromptu lunches with friends and colleagues. Professionally, its allowed me the ability to network, to develop professionally and to pursue new topics of intellectual curiosity. I recommend that you list out goals that you aim to accomplish each week. Then, at the more granular level, highlight the tasks that you want to accomplish each day using the Time Management Quadrant below, made famous by Stephen Covey in his bestselling book, The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People . You can choose to put these into time slots, depending on whether you use a daily planner or simply a task or milestone list for the day. Once you have something in writing, youve made an actionable commitment to get it done. Now, you can hold yourself accountable because you have a frame of reference as you navigate through your day.Use this daily planner as your baseline but by no means should you follow it to the letter of the law. ALWAYS allow yourself the ability to adapt and change if its in your best interest to do so. As the great (if not somewhat crazy) Mike Tyson once said, Everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the mouth. Chances are, you wont need to dodge monster right hooks over the course of your day. You will, however, encounter adversity and changes that force you to adapt and modify your plan. The highly successful person is always ready to make changes on the fly and is never exclusively wedded to a game plan.Things change. Be prepared! Reading your plan helps you process the information and store it in your conscious and subconscious mind. This way, you will remember whats important. No matter how good you think your short or long-term memory is, if you dont write or read your plan, you will forget some information. Where that will hurt you, in particular, is in Quadrant II per the chart above. Recognizing new opportunities is a skill that comes to those who have a clear, prepared mind. When you have clutter on your mind, you tend to worry more and get easily distracted. Thats when you end up in Quadrant III. Reading your plan helps you to visualize what you want to accomplish. When you visualize what you want to do, you have an image in your imagination. Your imagination gives birth to the ideas, goals and plans that you have. Suddenly, you have a vivid picture of seeing yourself successfully carry out your goals for the day. We can speak positively over our lives in two ways: 1) Actually speaking the words and 2) Sending the same words from our mind into our subconscious mind via, the voice inside our head. Both are powerful ways to build faith. Here, I want to focus a little more on the second way. The great Napoleon Hill once wrote: The key here is to speak positively and to do this throughout the day. Dont confuse this with ego-stroking or aggrandising behavior. The most successful people practice auto-suggestion to feed their subconscious mind, in an effort to fuel their success. When you mix positive emotions with positive encouragement, you have a winning combination. Scientific studies show that taking regular breaks help you to sharpen your focus increase your ability to perform. Throughout my career, Ive always built in time each day to get up, walk around and clear my mind. We werent meant to spend our whole day fixated on a computer screen or working nonstop on our feet without a break. Take some time to chill and relax. Get outside and walk around a bit, fresh air will do you good. The change will give you some perspective and could take the edge off any stress or anxiety youre dealing with. A close cousin to number two on this list, number five is an activity that helps you better frame the big picture for what youre hoping to accomplish. As with all the steps, this could be with tasks in your personal or professional life. Vision Boards have become very big over the last couple of years. Really, this is simply a tool to get you to plot out your dreams and goals and keep them in a place that you can see everyday. Theres an unmistakable correlation here to the concept of planting thoughts in your subconscious mind. This is a visual tool, whereas I touched earlier on verbal reminders and encouragement via the voice inside our head. Long-term goal planning will help you prioritize what matters to you. It puts your goals within the range of achievement. For longer-term goals, where applicable, attach dates to when you hope to accomplish these things. This allows you to plot out intervals and measure your progress along the way. Once you can start measuring and tracking your progress, the reality becomes clearer. If you want to be great and compete to your maximum ability, you need to operate by measurable criteria and goals. So far, Ive outlined those for you. You also need to get feedback from others. When you take the time to build in moments for reflection throughout your day, youre able to evaluate yourself. I also implore you to ask people that you can trust to give you the information you need to become a better person. Whether in the workplace from a colleague, at school with a student, or from a family member, friend or mentor, make a list of people you can trust and that you feel comfortable confiding in. Concerned, objective feedback will help you assess the current situation. Feedback will give you the tools you need to bridge the gap between where you are and where you need to be. Every time Ive improved in my life, either as a student, athlete, business professional or coach, Ive done so by soliciting feedback from other people, and then integrating these best practices for improvement into my routine. One of my life mantras is: Achievementboth your sense of self-worth and that of othersis well within your grasp if you have a positive, determined attitude and youre willing to work harder than anyone else. You may not always love everything you do. Heaven knows, our days will not be entirely comprised of pursuing our passions and loves all the time. There are responsibilities and tasks that dont always bring a smile to our face. Regardless, bring your best effort and attitude to everything that you do. The feeling, the emotional reward that comes with doing so is a brilliant sense of satisfaction to savor. Resting your mind and body are essential for living a successful, competitive life. If we never stop to rest, well eventually burn ourselves out and suffer the consequences. A proper amount of sleep and rest is vital to our health and productivity. But dont just take my word for it! Ill allow the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to point this out: During sleep, your body is working to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health. We all need to re-charge our mind and body everyday. Never underestimate your need to shut down, decompress and get some Zzs. Youll be better for it! Disclaimer: This is a curated post.

We think about using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. But what about some of the niche sites?  What about ? As a small business owner, is there a way to use an image-based social network to market yourself and your business? You bet there is! Below are just a few ways that small business owners can market their businesses with the help of Flickr. Sometimes when the front door is locked, its an opportunity to use the less-crowded side door, the one everyone has been neglecting.  If youve been having difficulty ranking for specific search terms using traditional on-page SEO and link-building efforts, you may want to start experimenting with image optimization and pick up additional rankings. By taking photos of things related to your corner of the world and then being diligent about optimizing associated titles, descriptions, photo sets and tags, you can help your image to appear in the Google Search results for the associated terms.   This can help that image to rank above a traditional big brand search result or increase the amount of SERP space your brand takes up. When youre taking time to optimize your photo for Flickr, dont forget to place a link to your website in the description. Sure, Flickr nofollows the links, which means no juice will pass from Flickr over to your site, but some of Flickrs 30 million-plus users may click and head over to your site to see if there are additional images, or to learn more about what you do.   Google may not be interested in your site link, but Flickr users are.  Dont leave them without a path to your site. Whats a better testimonial for your website than a smiling customer using your product, a fan wearing your companys T-shirt, or a picture of what someone was able to construct with your tool? Id argue there isnt one.  Encourage your customers to upload photos of themselves using your product and to tag your company so that others can find the photos.  Do a search for your business on the image site and find people who have already uploaded photos of your products.  Email them to say thank you (members with a PRO account can send unlimited emails) and ask if you can put that photo on your testimonials or Caught in the Act page, with a link back to their image. Stock photography sites can be a great place to find content; however, theyre getting . Instead of spending your time constantly filling up on credits, why not use Flickrs Creative Commons search to find images for content and linkbait pieces instead?  By using Flickrs Advanced Search options, small business owners can browse through photos that have been OKd for commercial use.   Depending on your topic, you may find hundreds of photos to choose from.  If you want to use this as a networking tool, you can then reach out to the owner of the photo you want to use, let them know you put it on your site and encourage them to show it off.   Now you get a free photo, plus some free promotion when that person tells all their friends that you deemed his/her photo cool enough to put on your website. Those are just a few ways that small business owners can use Flickr to market their business online? Whatd I miss? How have you taken advantage of Flickr to promote your business?","Reuters According to Bloomberg, economists estimate that the flash purchasing manager's index was 51.2.

But you can make up for that limitation with attention marketing. Attention marketing is all about attracting attention to your business and your brand  in such a way that you turn that attention into revenue. And thats what the new book,   is about. Author Jim Kukral earlier this week that the worst thing for a marketer is for people to forget about your brand.  Your goal should be to get a reaction. But, if you think this book is a PR (public relations) handbook, you would be wrong. Jim points out the difference between getting attention and publicity, noting in the book: In a section of the book that is sure to be controversial with some, the author goes on to state that bad attention can be good, especially if your brand is not yet well-known. He points out how Pamela Anderson and Paris Hilton both became global brands after unauthorized distribution of their sex tapes. For them, negative attention turned into a positive for their business interests. Jim himself has benefited from attention-getting behavior. Jim has the distinction of getting the attention of a billionaire, Mark Cuban, in 2 days time. Jim set up a website called MarkCubanPleaseCallMe.com and sent out a press release through PRWeb. The next day Jim found himself being interviewed by the , and later hears that Mark Cuban hates him. Not necessarily good attention, right? But in the end, it worked out quite positively. Jim ended up developing a friendly email relationship with Cuban, did a project with one of Cubans businesses, got to introduce Cuban as a keynote speaker  and in the process brought himself tons of publicity. It even got Cuban to give Jim a back-cover blurb for this book. (Cubans blurb appears right below mine  probably the only time Ill ever get top billing over Mark Cuban, but hey Ill take it.) The book focuses mostly on how to generate attention . Ive known Jim for years, because hes located here in the Cleveland, Ohio area as I am. I know that Jim has been making his living online for years. When I think of successful online entrepreneurs, his name is always one of the first that comes to mind. Ive learned a few things from Jim, too, that I put into place in my own business. For instance, one of the things Jim taught me is to be bold in emphasizing the impact of my own websites, by highlighting the number of small business owners my sites reach. Modesty is admirable as a personal attribute; but modesty in business wont help you pay your overhead and meet payroll. So I can confidently say, Jim Kukral is someone who knows what he is talking about when it comes to getting attention using the Web. This book is designed for entrepreneurs who are not satisfied with the status quo, but who want to build and grow an online business or one with a significant online component  but perhaps dont know how to go about it. Its especially good for those with more time than money. If this describes you, then you will find   a great investment.","Twitter has officially the launch of a new mobile Ads tool. Being referred to as the Twitter Ads companion, the tool allows advertisers to manage their campaigns from their smartphone or device while away from their desk. According to Twitter, the Ads companion will help advertisers check their campaigns performance and metrics either across all campaigns or individually. Users can see information regarding impressions, engagement, spend, cost per engagement, and engagement rate. Advertisers will alsobe able to review past campaigns through the tool. Twitter saysusers will also be able to perform tasks such as editing campaign bids, budgets and schedules, as well as respond to notifications and pause or resume campaigns. The Twitter Ads companion will not allow you to actually build a campaign though. That will still have to be done on your laptop or desktop computer prior to managing the campaign on your mobile device. The Ads companion tool is available to anyone with a Twitter Ads account and can be accessed from the Twitter app on iOS or Android devices. You wont have to download a completely different app. The button for the tool will appear in different places in the app depending on your device. For example, iPhone 6 or later users can find the button by going to their Twitter profile, then clicking the chart icon to access Twitter Ads. Whereas Android users will have to navigate to the setting drop down to find it. This is another of Twitter has been making recently. Those changes include alteration to the direct messaging character limit and the addition of video capturing and sharing capabilities. The departure of former CEO Dick Costolo of the big changes that seem to be under way on the platform.","To obtain the capital they need to finance their business operations, some micro-business owners tap the equity in their homes by drawing on home equity lines of credit. But in recent years, this strategy has become more difficult for business owners, as banks have cut back on home equity lending. Seventeen percent of businesses with less than $100,000 in sales use home equity lines of credit for business purposes, October 2012 Small Office/Home Office Opportunity study  a random sample of 100,000 small businesses with less than $100,000 in sales listed in Dun and Bradstreet  reveals. Thats surprisingly high. , that 18 percent of the self-employed dont own their own homes, so they cant get home equity lines of credit. that only 44 percent of businesses with fewer than 20 employees have a line of credit, whether drawn on their home or otherwise. Together these numbers suggest that just under half (47 percent) of micro business owners with homes and lines of credit made use of home equity to get the credit line. In absolute terms, a lot of micro enterprises use home equity lines of credit for business purposes. that there were approximately 25 million businesses with less than $100,000 in revenue in operation in the United States in 2008, the latest year data are available. Given Barlow Researchs estimate of the fraction with home equity lines of credit used for business purposes, that translates to more than 4 million micro business owners. These 4 million business owners have had a tough time with their financing strategy in recent years because of the declining home equity loan market. According to the Federal Reserve of New Yorks Quarterly Report on Household Credit, the number of home equity lines of credit fell from 23.9 to 18.7 million between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2012. Moreover, the amount of credit available on home equity lines of credit declined 39.3, and the balance on these loans 24.1 percent, percent in inflation adjusted terms, over the same period. As I have argued before, small business credit markets are linked with the housing market. During the housing market boom, micro business owners had an easier time getting credit for their companies because they could tap rising home equity levels. Since housing prices have deflated, however, and banks have cut back on home equity loans, microbusiness owners who used home equity to finance operations have found credit more difficult to get. If policy makers want to help ensure that microbusiness owners have access to sufficient credit, then they need to keep a careful watch on the housing market.","The Cicret Bracelet may turn out to be the latest evolution in a rapidly growing wearable market  if the device ever sees the light of day. And whats most interesting about this new gadget in particular, is that you already own half of it. Cicret is a bracelet that projects a fully-functioning Android tablet on your skin. Thats right: on your skin. So, if youre sporting the Cicret bracelet on your wrist, a small light beam on the device will project your standard, everyday Android home page right there on your forearm. And this includes making and taking phone calls. The wrinkle is that Cicret is just in the planning stages, according to . And a scam warning has been on the companys website. It warns against unscrupulous online sellers who may be suggesting they already have the device in stock. There is reportedly no actual working prototype. But there is a fully-functioning website that promotes an app that would be tied to the bracelet. Check out the video developers have created to demonstrate how the smart bracelet would work: On its website, the Cicret development team is seeking to raise $1 million to get its project off the ground. An earlier Indiegogio campaign is now after raising only $1,357 of the $500,000 developers were initially seeking. Right now, the effort is limited to asking for donations via PayPal. As a result, there is no established release date for Cicret. However, PhoneArena.com is that we could see a working prototype and public unveiling in a few weeks. It also reports that Cicret would support both Android and iOS. So assuming that the Cicret bracelet does become a reality, the device would hide a lot of small components within a winding band that goes around the wrist. Inside there would be a Pico projector to display the smartphone screen to which the Cicret is synced. There would also be a processor, a memory card, a micro USB port, a small battery, a Bluetooth chip, a WiFi chip and even an LED light. All these devices and any Bluetooth connected device would work together to replicate the Android experience youd normally get on your tablet or smartphone. Only this time that experience would be replicated on your wrist or wherever the Cicret Bracelet is attached. Its uncertain how much the device might ultimately cost if released. Another question is whether anyone would want it.","Laptops may be getting displaced by smartphones as the device of choice for mobile workers. Pop into any caf or third place where you hang out and youll see tables full of mobile workers, sans laptops and leaning back with smartphone in hand. When Skype asked me if I wanted a temporary evaluation unit, I jumped at the chance to review a new Motorola Droid X device by Verizon with Skype Mobile pre-installed on it. As a longtime early adopter of new gadgets ( I wont list them all here, but the Blackberry device is one that comes to mind), I found my productivity dropping a few years back and migrated to a dumb phone. I have been itching to test the true usability of the new generation of smartphone. Could they really be that useful for a super-busy small business owner? The answer is, hands down, yes. If youve been on the fence over whether to get a smartphone, this review is for you. I was skeptical that even the newest, coolest, Android or iPhone, would really help a small business make or save more money. I am now convinced. Let me share four ways a smartphone can help your business. If you have a physical presence (a retail store selling just about any product with a barcode, a computer repair service, or any real world location), you need to a smartphone to see what mobile local search results look like. What are customers seeing when they search for your business on a smartphone? The make-more-money component is pretty straightforward: If customers cant find you easily, they may not find you at all. More than search, you need to think proactively about what your customer can do and will do when he or she is in your store, or near it. If you havent readLisa Barones or her , be sure to check them out. Nearly every smartphone can manage a barcode scanning application via the camera function. Most will also read the more intelligent, customized QR code. This means your customer can snap a quick picture of any item in your store that has a barcode and get instant data on that item, including comparison online shopping information. To be clear: Most apps are not able to report on locally available inventory, but online inventories are readily available and easy to access. What does this scanning stuff really suggest? Customer service takes on a whole new meaning. It is so easy to buy elsewhere. Your store has to stand out with a great customer experience and service level. Also, competitive pricing is critical, as it has been for a long time. As some readers know, Ive been working on a local business project and in one part of it, I wandered through local stores. Some asked me to leave when I appeared to be using my camera. Some didnt notice. The point is: You can kick people out of your store for scanning a barcode; that is your prerogative. Is it a wise choice? I dont have the answer, but I have opinions. Combined with Google Local, Facebook Local, Groupon, FourSquare, and a host of other applications, you can put your special offer in front of customers who are nearby. You can create a customizable QR code and put it in your store window. Then anyone with a smartphone can scan that code and receive a special offer or message, for free. If they were not sure about coming in, the QR code gives them an easy, nonthreatening encounter with your brand (the code may or may not contain a special offer). Consumers with smartphones are actively looking for more information about your business (or at least what you provide) as they move around town. QR codes are easy to create; this open source site from makes it super easy. With a little creativity, youll see a range of ways to use these. I received this evaluation phone courtesy of Skype to test its functionality for the small business owner. Heres the skinny: It works perfectly for Skype-to-Skype calls (this particular phone is powered by Verizon) and doesnt cost you any money. I would highly recommend it because you likely know and have Skype users in your contact base. I know of several companies that run their customer service efforts through a dedicated Skype number, and if customers or prospects reach you on the platform, this mobile application can save you cell phone minutes. The Skype mobile service via Verizon does not let you call a landline or another cell phone as it might if you had a Skype Calling plan from your computer. While I had hoped to be able to do this, it wouldnt make sense for Verizon to allow this, as it would completely take them out of the cell phone equation. Everyone would load Skype mobile and use the cell phone backbone to make free calls. But, if you want the ability to make domestic and international Skype-to-Skype calls from your cell phone, this app and phone is a gem. Not all smartphones can run a voice-over-IP (VoIP) application. Overall, a smartphone is more than a tiny device to keep you ever-connected to e-mail. It is more than a way to save money on phone calls, though that is important and Skype is one easy way to do that. The main reason to consider any smartphone is because of the tectonic shift to mobile by your customers. You want to be able to see what they are seeing in search results, on review sites, on coupon-offer sites and on location-based services like FourSquare.

The company is the worlds third largest maker of smart phones and tablets right now, and thats all without much activity in the U.S. But that may change soon. The company unveiled a smartphone, a 7-inch phablet, an 8-inch tablet, a mobile hotspot, and a wrist activity tracker at the event. Company leadership said that making headway in the U.S. is its next goal, according to a Reuters . If Huawei can eventually gain a footing in the U.S. market, it could be a boon for small business owners who feel theyre spending too much on technology.Huawei devices are known for their affordable prices but few mobile carriers are actually offering the phones and tablets. At MWC, the company unveiled its new smartphone, the . The new smartphone features a 4.5-inch LCD display, weighs 115 grams and is 7.85 millimeters thick.It features a 5 megapixel front-facing camera and an 8 megapixel camera mounted on the rear of the device, too.

I enjoy it, I look forward to it and I still say its wherethe magic happens in relationships. But today, we have two worlds that are learning how to blend, balance and work together: In the past few years, so much emphasis and shifting has gone to the Web/online world because that is where the growth and movement trends are. In-person networking has taken a hit, as evidenced with declining enrollment in chambers of commerce, fee-based networking events and professional organizations. Its not that people dont to go; its simply a matter of finances . . . or is it? Are we substituting an e-mail, tweet, post or text for live, in-person activities. thinking that is going to grow relationships? We can never forget how important and powerful people getting together for face-to-face interaction can be. Nor can we allow sending e-mails or texts to replace that interaction. Blending your online and offline activities is important because today, people are communicating and engaging equally in both places. The online and offline worlds are interdependent and interrelated. If I meet you online and strike up an online relationship that has value and interest to me, then taking it offline is going to enhance that relationship and help it progress. If we meet in person, then staying connected online is going to enhance our relationship and help it progress until we meet in person again. I just moved back to my hometown of Ft. Lauderdale after a four-year career detour on the southwest coast of Florida. Although I have many roots from many years and careers, I am reconnecting with the market four years later and in a different professional capacity. I have decided to tap into my network and ask to be connected to like-minded people they know. I will reciprocate and network them with people I know to do the same for them. Finding out what events, groups and activities people go to is a much better way to find connections. If you havent been out and about enough, set some goals this year to reconnect in person in your community, business world or hobbies. Go where you already have commonality and know people. Its a much easier and faster way to get connected, get personal and make some new friends and connectionsand you just might get that job, interview or new customer.","Samsung/YouTube This month we welcome the Galaxy Note 7 onto the list, as the faulty battery issue is fixed and the device is now deemed safe to use.

However, we seem to have lost touch with our own rich intellectual heritage. Why not go back to our own roots, and learn from words of wisdom that are truly eternal? Our great epics (religious or not), surely have quotes that stand true to the modern times, even better than ever before. I am sure many of us must have explored or heard some great treasures hidden in ancient scripture . Below are a few which I tried to decode. I hope it will help entrepreneurs take away something from them.  A lot has been said and heard about karma, but the true essence lies in these two simple lines. Every entrepreneur should focus on their work i.e. karma without anticipating the result or outcome. You should not concentrate so much on the final product and just enjoy the process of reaching there. We get swayed by our vision and rely on its success too much. We forget it is pivotal to enjoy the whole process rather than just hoping for something that you know is anyway uncertain. Remember, having hopes or being optimistic is not wrong, but without actions, your path will be dreadful. The art lies in walking the tightrope and enjoy doing it. If the guy who walks the literal tightrope is scared or too excited, he will certainly fall. The trick to his success is that he enjoys it while he walks in order to reach the other end successfully. It is easy to say versatility and adaptation are the keys to success. But the biggest lesson for any entrepreneur is learning to adapt to changes quickly. Do not get stuck with your initial vision. Learn to adapt, innovate and implore new opportunities. Pave your journey like a traveller, who is not attached to the city he visits or the hotel he stays in but enjoys the experience of it all. Do not be adamant; be innovative, open minded and ready to absorb experiences like a sponge. The faster you adapt to a change, the better it is. Remember, change is the only constant. It is imperative for all entrepreneurs to have control over their anger. With anger goes away our ability to reason and we tend to become delusional. The confusion and chaos generated by anger leads to memory loss. The individual is moved away from his purpose and goals. Anybody who seems to have forgotten their goals or lost their clarity of thought cannot succeed. Therefore, it is important for people to free themselves from anger. A simple solution to this problem is focus. Never lose your focus and never underestimate the virtue of patience. Inculcate the habit of being open to everything and being attached to nothing. Attachment does give strength to work and love beyond ourselves, but it also limits us and makes our journey and growth difficult, especially if the object of our desire is taken away from us. Too much desire can be bad, as it turns into greed. Greed takes you away from your true calling and dream, be it to achieve, create or innovate. Do not be super attached to your work, as it makes your journey as an entrepreneur difficult and closed. You cannot wear binoculars and run the rat race. You have to keep an open mind about the ever-evolving market changes, adapt to them. Keep a close eye on your goals but do not get obsessive. This simple has the deepest meaning. It is like a dissuading curse  as everything pure has a covering that can often be misleading. For example, fire is covered with smoke, which prevents us from nearing it and if a mirror is covered in sheen, we cannot see what it is reflecting before removing the sheen. Similarly knowledge is covered with desire that we must ignore or get rid of. We must ignore the curtain of desire in order to imbibe knowledge that will help us grow. This isnt as easy as it looks but wise man is one who knows what to avoid and what to select.","Community Connect Inc. has an immediate opening for a talented and self-motivated Product Strategist.

The operators have asked the telecom department (DoT) to ask RIL to take back the Jio connections that it has provided to 1.5 million users under the name of test connections, since it is breaking the law by offering full-fledged services to them before its launch.  In a letter written to Telecom Secretary JS Deepak, telecom lobby group Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said that as per present licence conditions, testing or trials of free voice and data services is not allowed for such large numbers, and Jio was instead offering full fledged services to its users.

But a recent study by researchers from Harvard Business School and Boston University involving reviews of restaurants in the Boston area indicates otherwise.The data presented by researchers suggests that as many as 16 percent of Yelp reviews may be fake. Whats more, the authors say the incentives created by review sites may actually be encouraging the practice. In Fake It Till You Make It: Reputation, Competition, and Yelp Review Fraud, researchers Michael Luca of Harvard Business School and Georgios Zervas of Boston University (PDF): Newer businesses or those with few reviews are more tempted to fake it, the study concludes.Researchers mention a trend for businesses to have larger numbers of positive reviews early in their life-cycle as evidence of this.They also conclude that businesses that recently received a bad review may be more tempted to cheat. While Yelp does filter reviews identified as suspicious using a proprietary algorithm, site visitors can still view them by solving a captcha puzzle, the study explains. Still, penalties can be harsh for businesses caught faking reviews on Yelp or other sites. For example, businesses recently caught in Operation Clean Turf will .

Yelp also recently filed suit against a San Diego law firm claiming the company .","Googles getting into the holiday spirit a little early this year, announcing the availability of .  The coupon part has been around for , however, Googles done a pretty good job failing to promote them. But no longer. With the change, any business owner who creates and adds a mobile coupon to their Google Local Business listing will now have the option to make that coupon accessible via a mobile device.  That means customers and prospective customers looking up your location on their phone will be able to access your coupons without the need of a printer or rusty pair of scissors.  Pretty savvy. To make a coupon, simply head to your Local Business listing and click on the Coupons tab. If you havent claimed your listing yet, its really .   Once youre set up, youll be able to create your coupon like everyone else. If youve never created a Google coupon before, the process is pretty painless.  Youll be asked for your business name, coupon heading, optional sub-heading, the specifics of your coupon, an image, expiration date and other like information.  Once youve entered in all your data, Google will give you a preview for how the coupon will look both on your Google Place Page and on a mobile device Once live, when a user views your Google Local Business listing on their phone theyll see a section that shows them all available coupons.  They can then click around to access the mobile-formatted version to show the sales clerk for redemption.  Its pretty simple. [I tried to find a coupon shot in the wild butI wasnt able to find any businesses currently using Google coupons  which is perhaps part of the problem and reason for the release.] I think this is a great add on right in time for the holiday season.  It gives small business owners one more reason to claim their listing and it encourages them to experiment with a for their site.  Its also a very strong draw for customers who love feeling like theyre getting something for free.  Having coupons attached to your Google Business Listing is a great differentiator and one that I hope more SMBs will start using. Its also a great way to see whos finding you from the Web, as opposed to traditional means. Its worth noting that if you DO already have Google coupons, youll want to edit them to now be mobile-accessible.  Google wont change that default for you.

Independent booksellers and small publishers dont see it that way. They were angry. They see the Presidents action as supporting a large corporation that they claim has a monopoly, at the expense of small businesses. In his remarks at the behemoth Amazon warehouse, President Obama said, Im calling on our businesses to do more for their workers. Amazon is a great example of whats possible.

I talked to Jeff Bezos yesterday, and he was so proud of the fact that he wants to see every employee at Amazon continually upgrade their skills and improve. But the independent players in the book publishing industry werent buying it. Dennis Johnson, co-founder of Melville House, an independent publisher located in Brooklyn, New York, about what he considers Amazons near monopoly status, its ability to undercut competitors, lose money and yet on top of that, still get lauded by the President as a champion of jobs. he called the Presidents move an insult added to injury to those of us in the book business.

In fact, researchers at the University of Maryland recently used videos to teach a robot how to make salads. The robot, named Julia (after Julia Child), learned each step of the salad making process after watching YouTube videos of people completing those same steps. It was then able to emulate those steps itself, though not without some difficulty. In certain areas, most notably pouring the dressing there were challenges. The video below spells out more: And while making a salad might not seem like the most exciting or innovative use of robot technology, the team is hopeful this is just the first step. Its part of a process of teaching robots in a way that might someday benefit all of society. Yiannis Aloimonos, a computer science professor at the university, Time: So, while today Julia is focused on learning the fine art of salad making, tomorrow it could be learning to make other foods using the same methods. The robot could eventually learn how to do other tasks like moving boxes on a factory floor or stocking shelves at a store. The technology is still in its early stages. Robots arent in the process of taking over jobs on any sort of large scale at the moment. However, the team is hopeful that in the future this technology might enable robots to become part of the workplaces. Cornelia Fermller, a research scientist at the university, told Time: Its unlikely that robots will really take over human jobs on a large scale. Even if and when they do make their way into workplaces, theyre still likely to need supervision and/or operators. But their ability to do manual labor and simple tasks could certainly free up some human workers for more complicated or thoughtful types work.","More than a year after Hurricane Sandy pummeled the East Coast, homeowners and businesses are still in the process of and recovering from the storms damage. Unfortunately, many of those affected by Sandy have found its taking longer than expected to receive the funds they need to get back on their feet. In many cases, the expected source of those funds is an insurance company. While its easy to demonize insurance providers for not paying the claims of affected businesses, thats often an unfair characterization. Heres a look at why it sometimes takes a long time to receive insurance benefits after a covered event and how you can ensure that, if youre ever struck with a disaster, your business gets its claims covered in a timely fashion. This is a common chorus among business owners affected by serious property damage like that caused by Sandy. And its no wonder: In the aftermath of a major storm or other property event, emotions run high. For small-business owners, their lifes work may be lying in tatters at their feet. When your insurance company denies a claim you submit, it can feel personal. In reality, claim denials are pure business. Take, for instance, this tangled insurance claim related to Sandy. Some hotels submitted business interruption claims that were denied because the insurance companies couldnt agree on whether power outages caused the interruption or they were caused by a flood (not covered) or an explosion (covered). In less severe disasters, claim denials are often a matter of a business owners failure to adhere to the byzantine claims-submission process insurance companies mandate. Think, for example, of swiping a debit card backwards at an ATM. Your card may be denied over and over until you match the magnetic strip to the reader  once you do that, voil. You can access your money. Before you follow those rules, though, its easy to become frustrated when the machine wont give you the cash thats rightfully yours. So how can you access insurance benefits when you need them most? Admittedly, its a little more complicated than flipping a debit card around. But once you do adhere to the insurance companys rules, you should find that your claims are covered exactly as your policy said they would be. Heres a step-by-step guide to getting your business insurance claims covered as quickly and efficiently as possible: The most impactful things you can do for getting claims covered happen long before a storm strikes. Preparation includes taking pictures of your property and inventory, noting serial numbers for major equipment, keeping a copy of your insurance policy somewhere outside your office, and programming your insurance agents number into your phone. Having all these things handy will make the claims process much easier and quicker. Not sure what kinds of events your insurance policy covers? Then break out your paperwork and get ready to dig through some jargon. Or call your agent and ask for a detailed run-through of your coverages and exclusions. Its better to find out that youre not covered in the event of a flood now than when your storeroom is submerged in a foot of standing water. If you and your agent discover coverage gaps, update your policy to eliminate them. Its also essential to update your policy any time your business evolves, whether that means adding new services, selling new products, expanding or updating your offices, investing in new equipment, hiring new employees, or anything else. If you dont update your policy and youre hit with an incident, you may not be covered. When disaster hits your business, your instinct is likely to get in there and start cleaning up. But doing so without documenting the worst of the damage can prevent you from receiving full benefits from your insurance provider. After any claims incident  whether its the theft of a laptop or a major storm  take a moment to photograph the affected area or damaged items. This will make the claims adjustment process go more quickly so you can receive benefits as soon as possible. Following a major disaster, it may be wise to contact the contractors who can get your office up and running before calling your insurance company. Why? Because there are only so many roof repair and construction companies in your area, and after a major disaster, theyll be inundated with repair requests. Getting yours in as quickly as possible will ensure youre at the front of the line for getting your building back in working order. This call should happen right away  directly after making calls to contractors. Insurance companies are known for efficiently getting claims adjustors to disaster areas to process damage and determine what needs to be done. The sooner you contact your agent, the sooner you can start the process that ends with receiving a check to repair or replace what youve lost. Keep in mind, too, that contacting your agent is only the beginning of a process that can take some time. Chances are, your insurance company will lowball you on a repair estimate, based on their appraisers assessment of your damage. Why? Because insurance companies are also running a business. They have to think about their bottom line, which is helped by paying as little in claims as possible. Rather than thinking of them as the bad guy, recognize that this is how their business model works and be ready to assert the needs and interests of your business. This starts with the independent appraisers estimate, which will likely be higher than the insurance companys. So how do you convince your insurance provider to pay more than it initially offers? The key is in documentation. Provide estimates from your appraiser, estimates from the contractors who will do repairs, documentation of the condition of your property before the damage, documentation of the damage, and any other materials that can support your case. Making your case carefully will take some time and effort. But it will pay off when you receive adequate benefits to complete the repairs you need to get back on your feet. Yes, you have to pay for your insurance policy. But merely having a piece of paper in your safe wont protect your business any more than having a gym membership will magically make you fit. Just as you have to play an active role in getting in shape, you need to play an active role in ensuring that your insurance policies are suited to your current risk exposures and your claims are filed according to the rules so you end up protected when you most need coverage. The good news is that, just as trainers can demystify the various weight machines and cardio classes to help you achieve your fitness goals, an insurance agent can guide you through the processes of buying the right policies, updating those to match your changing business, and filing any claims that arise.","The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) just published its .

Topping the list of the most favorable states for small businesses and startup entrepreneurs and investors are: 1) South Dakota 2) Texas 3) Nevada 4) Wyoming 5) Washington 6) Florida 7) Alaska 8 ) Alabama 9) Ohio 10) Colorado There is an interactive map showing the best states for businesses taxes, in green. Middle of the road states are blue. And the worst states are in red: And what are the worst states for business taxes by name? It probably wont be a surprise that many of them are in the Northeast, long having reputations for being expensive jurisdictions to do business in: 42) Connecticut 43) Hawaii 44) Vermont 45) California 46) Maine 47) Iowa 48) New York 49) New Jersey 50) Minnesota 51) District of Columbia The Business Tax Index 2012 ranks the states from best to worst based on the cost of their tax systems on entrepreneurs and small businesses. The Index takes into account 18 different tax measures, and combines them into a single score so the different states and the District of Columbia can be compared. The 18 measures include income tax, individual capital gains rate, corporate income tax, added income tax on S-Corporations, property taxes, sales tax, death tax, Internet access tax, the so-called , gas tax and wireless tax  among others. According to Raymond J. Keating, chief economist for the SBE Council and author of the report, said,All taxes matter, whether imposed at the federal,stateor local level of government. They matter to consumers, entrepreneurs, investors and businesses.Stateand local levies matter in terms of astates competitiveness. And they matter when it comes to economic growth and job creation. And so how does the listing compare with past years? I checked the and found very little difference in either the top or bottom rankings. One notable exception: Massachusetts managed to pull itself out of the bottom 10 and in 2012 now ranks number 35. Hawaii and Connecticut, on the other hand, slipped a few spots since 2010. Other states may have shifted a bit here and there, but the top and bottom are still largely the same two years later (or the states were near misses with making it into the top or bottom 10). This year, the SBE Councils 2012 report notes these positive and negative developments:","There are dozens, if not hundreds, of social media books out there.

We saw Google survey conducted by found that while mobile coupons ARE catching on, theyre not doing so at the speed many small business owners may have hoped.  In fact, adoption is still pretty slow. According to the study, customers are still hesitant to take advantage of mobile coupons as we roll out of the recession. The study found that just four percent of users surveyed had redeemed mobile coupons and that only 10 percent of users surveyed said they felt comfortable storing coupons on their mobile phone as opposed to printing them out. Not surprisingly, younger consumers are more likely to use mobile coupons. And that really seems to be the trend. While and find magazines the most helpful form of advertising, younger shoppers are headed to their phones. eMarketer noted: While current adoption numbers may be low, the signs for growth are there and offer interested retailers some hope.  Sixty-six percent of younger adults said they were at least somewhat likely to try mobile coupons, with 31percent of overall respondents said theyd be willing to give their mobile number to a retailer in order to receive coupons. Not surprisingly, that number grew to one-half when talking to 18- to-34 year olds.  And this echoes much of what weve seen with social media.  Customers are willing to friend, fan and follow your brand if youre willing to . Though the numbers look bleak, I think the key takeaway here is that mobile coupons are catching on, especially for businesses targeting a younger demographic. Mobile coupons are still the new kid on the scene, with more companies, restaurants, and grocers starting to launch mobile coupons each month. Exposure is growing and with that comes adoption. As people get more comfortable shopping via their mobile devices and looking up information the go, mobile coupons become a natural extension of that.","The De-Waster 5000 is a helicopter that scoops plastic out of landfills and the ocean then uses a flamethrower to melt the trash into beds for homeless people. Its not a real product. But it is a creative prototype that was thought up by a 10-year-old as part of the . The event took place on Nov. 15 in five cities around the world, and encouraged children to spend the day designing solutions to improve food, waste, or mobility issues in their hometowns. Emer Beamer is the founder of Unexpect, a Dutch agency that teaches design concepts to kids with the goal of tackling global challenges. She the philosophy behind the event to Fast Company: As proven by the De-Waster 5000, kids often come up with creative and outrageous solutions to problems that adults wouldnt think of. While some of these solutions may not actually be feasible, they definitely demonstrate some out-of-the-box thinking other innovators should be paying close attention to. At the same time, other suggestions from these youthful innovators may have a much more practical application. Take the suggestion of some students in Amsterdam for a robotic trashcan that sorts out recyclable materials and alerts the garbage truck when its full. While the fanciful suggestions of these young creative thinkers may never become reality, the concept of creative problem solving should be familiar to entrepreneurs. Its the same kind of creative problem solving they use everyday to develop new products and new services and to put new technologies to creative use. So an educational approach that stresses more creative problem solving also encourages an entrepreneurial outlook. Its an approach that could and should lead to more entrepreneurship  or at least, to a more entrepreneurial way of facing challenges in the future no matter what the size of your company.","Raise your hand if you are motivated all the time?

Currently, the program allows foreigners who invest $1 million in a U.S. business and create 10 or more jobs to get a visa; the investors want Washington to include those entrepreneurs who attract funds from venture capitalists or business angels. While the bills advocates have gotten it introduced into the and , the effort has stalled. Recently, Canada announced that it will launch a   program this spring. For the next five years, our neighbor to the north will make 2,750 visas available annually to entrepreneurs who have received a $200,000 funding commitment from an approved venture capitalist or $75,000 from an approved business angel. The Canadian governments announcement has gotten U.S. start-up visa advocates upset. In a recent online column, Brad Feld, one of the advocates of a similar program in the United States, expressed frustration that . Rather than bemoan their political difficulties, however, advocates of the law should change their strategy. They should replace their we-need-immigrant-entrepreneurs-to-save-America argument with the following approach: Giving out visas is a better and cheaper way to get small companies to move here than than offering tax breaks. The advocates current argument is economically suspect and politically problematic. Proponents of a start-up visa argue that immigrants are better entrepreneurs than non-immigrants. But, as I have explained before, theres plenty of evidence that the are as good, if not better, at entrepreneurship than . More importantly, the immigrants-are-better argument is a political nightmare. What Congressman wants to tell his constituents that he needs to support a start-up visa bill because the voters who elected him arent as good at entrepreneurship as foreigners? The best argument for a start-up visa is the same argument for giving foreign companies tax breaks to start or expand their U.S. operations: it shifts wealth and jobs from overseas to the United States. If venture capitalists fund a start-up in San Paolo, for example, most of the jobs created and taxes paid by the new company occur there. But if the investors fund the same new business in San Francisco, most of the jobs and taxes end up in the United States. Even if the entrepreneurs would create more jobs and wealth if they established their businesses in their home countries, the law would make sense for the United States. Creating 1000 American jobs is better for those who live here than creating 2000 foreign ones. Offering the entrepreneurs visas as a way to get them to start companies here is a cheap and effective way to attract companies. Unlike the case with big companies considering locating a plant elsewhere, U.S. tax breaks arent much of an attraction to foreign entrepreneurs. But American residency is. Framed as a program to get foreign businesses to move to America, a start-up visa is a political no brainer for Congress. Without spending a cent of taxpayers money, we get non-U.S. companies to set up shop here. If the businesses succeed, create jobs and pay taxes, then American voters win. The only losers in the deal are people in the entrepreneurs native lands who dont get the jobs and tax revenue from the successful businesses. However, those people dont vote in American elections, so their welfare matters little to those in Congress.","  ST PETERSBURG/MOSCOW Russia and Turkey took a big step towards normalising ties on Tuesday when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his visiting Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan, at a time when both countries have strained relations with the West. An official in Erdogan's office said there was a clear consensus about improving relations that were damaged when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian border late last year. ""The general mood has been very positive,"" the official said after the meeting in St. Petersburg. ""Your visit today, which you made despite the really complex domestic political situation in Turkey, shows we all want to restart our dialogue and restore our relations,"" said Putin, addressing Erdogan. Erdogan's visit is his first foreign trip since the abortive putsch, in which more than 240 people were killed. Turkey has been incensed by the concerns expressed by Washington and European capitals about Ankara's post-coup crackdown but what is sees as indifference to the attempted coup itself. Putin told Erdogan that he hoped Ankara could fully restore order after a failed military coup last month, saying Moscow always opposed unconstitutional actions. Erdogan's trip is being closely watched in the West where some fear his growing detente with Moscow could affect his links with NATO, of which Turkey is a member.  Putin welcomed Erdogan in a Tsarist-era palace just outside his home town and immediately signalled he was ready to improve relations with Turkey, which he said had gone from a historical high point to a very low level. SUPPORT The Russian president categorically condemned the failed military coup.  ""I want to again say that it's our principled position that we are always categorically against any attempts at unconstitutional actions,"" he said. ""I want to express the hope that under your leadership the Turkish people will cope with this problem (the coup's aftermath) and that order and constitutional legality will be restored."" Putin had said the two men would discuss how to restore trade and economic ties, and cooperation against terrorism. They were also expected to discuss Syria, a conflict where the two countries find themselves on opposing sides, with Moscow backing President Bashar al-Assad and Ankara wanting him out of power.  Russia imposed trade sanctions on Turkey in the wake of the shooting down of its warplane and the number of Russian tourists visiting the country fell 87 percent in the first half of 2016. Erdogan said Turkey was entering a ""very different period"" in its relations with Russia, and that solidarity between the two countries would help the resolution of regional problems. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the Bild daily that he was not worried about Russia and Turkey improving ties. ""It is good that after the shooting down of the Russian fighter jet by Turkey last year, there is a rapprochement,"" he said. ""At the same time I do not believe that relations between the two countries will become so close that Russia can offer Turkey an alternative to the NATO security partnership.""

Known for controversial topics and heated discussions among respected competitors, the fifth annual network panel filled the room. Rarely do managers get the opportunity to hear the brightest influencers in the affiliate marketingindustry address the industry, as a whole, both present and future. , Founder and Managing Director of Acceleration Partners, skillfully guided the panel to the hottest trends and discussions within the industry. Below are the representatives from the selected networks: The first question to the panel was to discuss the biggest changes in the industry since last years panel. Brain Littleton started the discussion addressing how the momentum of attribution continues from last year. More merchants and affiliates participate in deeper discussions with regard to attribution. Brands continue to require validation that the affiliate marketing channel provides incremental value. Networks and service providers need to provide the strategy and tools that relate to providing the evidence of these incremental sales. Michael Jones, of eBay Enterprises, says: Todd Crawford from Impact Radius encouraged managers to focus on the data. As brands continue to test their vendors (or in house managers) about incremental value, the manager requires the most accurate data. With this accurate data, the affiliate manager or service provider can provide an objective view or strategy. Heexplains that we are in the digestion point where we need to have discussions based on the data collected. Acceleration Partners divides their attribution into internal (looking within the affiliate program) as well as Intra attribution (collects data across all channels). Glazer explains: Desiree Toto of CJ Affiliate by Conversant explains the CJ approach is a more analytical approach that integrates with existing software such as Omniture. The focus is less about the transactional level but more about proper representation within the overall analytic platform. In regards to attribution resulting in fractionalized commissions, CJs approach looks first from a data prospective. After reviewing the clickstream, CJ noticed less than one percent of the affiliate clickstream had multiple affiliates in the clickstream. As such, CJ does not focus on attribution level commission structure but rather providing data from the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) prospective. Crawford explained the value of attribution modeling and crediting logic accordingly. Attribution models view all players who contributed to the conversion. With this view, a manager can determine if adjusting the payment/commission makes sense. A holistic view of all marketing channels is crucial. He says: Jones clarifies that affiliate marketing is so much more valuable than that last click sale. All networks were in agreement. Attribution and a focus on incremental value creates sustainability for the affiliate channel. While attribution may create a painful change in the long run, the benefits to the channel far outweigh the pain. Littleton warns to use common sense when evaluating attribution data and reviewing multichannels. Data can support any channel. Be wary of feeling overwhelmed by the data and making bad business decisions as a result. The panel chorused in agreement and stressed just because you can do something does not mean you should. Choots Humphries confirmed the importance of aligning attribution models with overall goals. Loop back to ensure goals were met. Humphries says: With attribution taking front stage, communication is more crucial than ever. Affiliates, managers and CMOs all need to be part of the communication and strategy. If a tiered commission structure is presented, affiliates need to be part of the discussion. In addition, overly complicated commissions generate distrust among the affiliates. The strategy should involve communication and implementation strategies. On the corporate side, account managers need to be part of the discussionsandmodeling. Is affiliate being considered in the modeling up front versus a retro vision and fix? Affiliate marketing has negative baggage that it has carried with it for years. It is hard to break that perception. Perception is reality, explains Jones. The attribution products, for multichannel need, prove their value. Affiliates are an easy way to justify the cost of the software. You can call back commissions but not any other marketing fees. Make sure they arent leveraging affiliates to prove their value. Instead use the attribution modeling to prove the affiliate channel value. In the end, attribution is a new friend of affiliate marketing. Compared to last years discussions, mobile sites are now tracking. However, the problem remains how do we get companies to get app tracking? Merchants arent even informing managers that an app has been launched. Crawford explains: However, Littleton and other panelists agreed that in-app tracking should not be a priority for network. Currently there is no clear strategy with regards to the apps resulting in a lot of disorganization. Data will not assist with this issue. Additionally, there are inherent tracking issues due to the cookie drop technology. On an app, there is only one pixel. The advertiser is going to track the life of the users. Not going to pick affiliate marketing. You cant add more. Pixel called an SDK. As such you need to create an SDK that LinkConnector spends resources to take advantage of this situation. There are technologies out there trying to resolve this gap. Toto explains CJ does have its own SDK but there is a lot of complexity in the tracking. The conclusion of this interactive and thought-provoking panel illustrates the need for a holistic view of all marketing channels to illustrate the inherent value of the affiliate channel. All panelists agree onthe importance of accurate data but, more importantly, on the strategic use of this data. As the industry and technology grows together, a mature and powerful affiliate channel will take the spotlight.","Its that time of year again. Its time to spring clean your small business.

(Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru)","Microsoft is cutting the price on its Surface 2 just a month after cuts to the prices of its Surface Pro 2 devices. The Surface 2 runs the much-maligned Windows 8 RT operating system. Microsoft will be taking $100 off the regular prices of the tablets. That means the 32GB Surface 2 will now cost $349. The 64GB version will run $449, and the 64GB version with 4G LTE connectivity will cost $579. The discounts will be available at Microsofts brick-and-mortar and online retail locations an on other eCommerce sellers like Amazon. Microsoft has indicated that this price reduction is only good until Sept. 27 and that customers are limited to a total of 5 discounted Surface tablets per purchase. ArsTechnica has the price cut could be because Microsoft is planning to discontinue the model. If so, Microsoft may be trying to clear out some overstock Surface 2 devices. But it could also mean that Microsoft is preparing to unveil a successor to the Surface 2. In early July Microsoft also devices in anticipation of the Surface Pro 3 which began shipping this month. Microsoft reduced the price of its 64 GB machine from $899 to $799 and the price of its 512 GB machine from $1,799 to $1,599. The Surface 2 thats being discounted was introduced last October. The only change to this device has been the addition of a 4G LTE version. But could that really mean Microsoft is getting ready to ditch the Surface 2 altogether and, at the same time, bid adieu to Windows RT once and for all? The report from ArsTechnica suggests that Microsoft likely wont do that right away. The same processors that run Windows RT are also used in Windows Phone. These processors do limit the number of apps that these devices can run, though. Or could it be because Microsoft is planning to introduce a new product? Recently details were leaked about the , a $99 laptop which might be an inexpensive answer to Chromebook while running a full version of Windows 8.1. So similar devices heavily reliant on the cloud but using the Windows operating system more familiar to small businesses, could be waiting in the wings.","Wouldnt it be great to have an entrepreneurs handbook?

Maki does a masterful job of getting to the point in each paragraph. Take the paragraph called Set goals for results and activities. Maki references the movie 21, where a team of brainy MIT students uses a card counting system to win. Instead of wishing each other good luck, they would instead say good fluctuations when they headed out to play.

At the same time, well look at some of the challenges small businesses continue to face and how to overcome them. .Rising national debt, a very slow economic recovery, and financial markets hesitant to lend needed capital have resulted in continued high unemployment.  The President, as well as many in Congress have advocated a major program on infrastructure improvements.  While the Chamber agrees with this idea to create jobs, they feel it is only a short term solution.  The chambers feel strongly that there needs to be a change in and consistency in long term policies that will result in the economic revitalization of America.  They believe these policies must have a strong small business emphasis since small businesses are the greatest job creators. . The number of self-employed people has decreased about ten percent since the middle of 2008.  One of the contributing factors has been the lack of demand for their products and services.

Butwho are these mythical people were supposed to be talking to all the time? What do they look like and where do they hang out? And why does no one ever tell us? Well, today we will!  As a small business owner, there are five types of influencers that you should be aware of and reaching out to on social media. Want to know who they are? Remember high school? Remember those people that seemed to know everyone regardless of which party you went to or what corner you were hanging out on? These people also exist on the Web.  The Social Butterflies are the names and avatars who live to connect people from inside their different networks. If you need a programmer, they know a guy. If you need 100 invitations made by yesterday, they have a friend who does that. Theyll make the introduction for you because they take pleasure in mixing up their networks. Social Butterflies are valuable to a small business owner because of how wide their net reaches. By forming a close relationship with the, you get access to everyone else who is in their network.  You also ensure that the Butterfly will mention YOUR name to her contacts when the time comes.  Where do Social Butterflies hang out? Everywhere!  To identify them, try creating contact groups (via Twitter Lists or Facebook/LinkedIn groups, for example) and then look for the names that seem to overlap. These are your Butterflies. Thought leaders are the voices that your customers trust and listen to most. Theyre usually the same people whose content youre constantly watching get retweeted and whose blogs get more comments in a day than you get in a month. It takes some effort to get these people to acknowledge you because theyre constantly being inundated with messages, but if you can prove yourself by sharing valuable information and being a good social media citizen, youll be handsomely rewarded when its your content theyre blasting out to their loyal networks. Thought leaders can help you build your own authority by lending you their platform. When they tweet out your material or offer to help you with a blog post, you get to take advantage of their contact and increase the eyes looking at your site.  If youre looking for Thought Leaders in social media, you wont have to look too far. Theyre speaking at conferences, getting quotes in the most high profile stories, and are always being referenced in other peoples tweets and post. To get the most return, dont go for the Superstar Thought Leaders, stick to who is most influential in your niche. Every industry has its own set of trendsetters. Theyre the early adopters and the people that others listen to. The Trendsetters were on Twitter and FourSquare before everyone else and now theyre trying out a new social networking site that you cant even spell.  Trendsetters are motivated greatly by ego and are always on the hunt for whats new so they can tell their friends they found it first.  They love getting the scool, so get their attention, and theyll be proud to share you with all 5,000 of their closest friends. Trendsetters are powerful forces in social media because of their need to constantly be trying and sharing new things. If youre looking for these people in social media, you can find them reading TechCrunch, commenting on Mashable and tweeting about sites and applications youve never even heard of. This includes the bloggers, reporters and news outlets that live and breathe your industry.  Theyre the bylines you constantly see and the people most immersed in your industry because they write about it every day.  This group is super important to connect with because they hold three coveted things  press, coverage and links.  SMB owners need to know how to get the attention of people who link. Obviously, as a small business owner, you want to create relationships with the Reporters that cover your niche to get your business in front of their audience. You want to form relationships with these folks as early as you can so that you can keep them alert to big things happening in your small business.  Once you identify these people, youll want to create a so that you know who you should reach out to when you need press. Your Everyday Customer has a much smaller circle of influence than The Reporters or The Social Butterflies, but its just as important. Your Everyday Customers are the people who live in your town and could potentially walk in and spend money with you today.  You want to use social media to create awareness with them. This group is often neglected in social media as brands attempt to go for the higher hanging fruit. However, reach one of these folks and youre almost guaranteed that theyll pass on their experience to their family and friends.  Theyre all about worth of mouth and sharing recommendations.  If youre looking for them on social media, they can most often be found asking questions on Twitter or participating in group discussions on Facebook and LinkedIn.  Theyre unassuming, but vocal when given the chance. Those are groups I concern myself with when talking about influencers. Are they any influencer groups you focus on not mentioned here?","Yahoo is set to expand its Stream Ads service to allow other Web publishers beyond a close knit group of publishing partners to include its sponsored posts on their sites as well. The Yahoo ads will appear as recommended content on participating websites. The recommended content will pull not only from sponsored posts but also a publishers own content. Currently, Yahoos Stream Ads appear only on sites such as SB Nation, GameSpot and TV Guide. But according to a from AdAge.com, Yahoo plans to open up its advertising platform to other publishers too in the near future. For other Web publishers this may mean additional monetization by placing Yahoo display ads on heir sites and alongside their content. For advertisers, it broadens the reach of ads that can be purchased through Yahoos app. If more publishers are placing these ads on their sites, it will allow businesses to reach more readers. The ads appear similar to those created by a service like , which also recently announced new opportunities for online publishers to use its advertising platform. At the bottom of a sites own unique content, four picture boxes with headlines below them appear on a content page. These posts appear under the heading Recommended. If a websites visitors click the sponsored posts beneath the content theyve just read, that sites publisher will share in the ad revenue. No exact terms for this share of revenue have been disclosed. Whats unique about Yahoos service is that it will include, initially of course, three posts from within the site thats publishing the Stream Ads. The fourth post among those Recommended will be a sponsored post. AdAge reports that nearly all those ads will come from Yahoos ad portal, Gemini. Gemini is a do-it-yourself app that allows companies to pay for and customize their advertising on the Yahoo network.","Most articles are great at listing all the things you can spend your limited startup funds on. But through experience, weve learned some lessons about wasting money and how to avoid the nonessential aspects of a startup. Here is my list of things NOT to spend on if you can avoid it in the first 6 months. By spending wisely you preserve your funds for the things that count. Also, in the first 6 months of your business you have certain priorities  this list will keep you on track. Im not saying to NEVER spend on these things  in fact depending on your business you may have to spend on some of them  just think carefully in the first six months. They can be expensive and distract you. In the first six months your head should not be on conferences unless you can calculate a specific dollar ROI from going (such as, youre being paid a speaking fee). Travel is not only expensive, but you are less productive during travel. When I travel, Im lucky to get one-third of my normal daily workload handled. Aside from a critical sales call that you simply MUST attend  use email and phone instead. Skype video conferences andGoogleHangouts are two free substitutes for in-person meetings. Real Estate is the leading cause of death for startups, Ross Mayfield, co-founder of SocialText . Obviously, if you run a local retail business, you need a shop. But today, many kinds of businesses can work virtually and need not saddle themselves with fixed lease costs in the first 6 months. As famed tech investor , The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people. This bites you twice: in addition to increasing your costs, it slows you down. Adding employees requires you take the time to bring people on board, communicate with them so they understand the vision, and allow time for them to get acclimated. In some businesses, such as a restaurant, you MUST hire if you expect the business to run. But many other kinds of businesses are better off focusing on product development, marketing and/or sales before hiring a lot of people. Plus, you want to give yourself the time to select the best talent for permanent hires; go with freelancers and contractors whenever possible in the first 6 months. Get a website up early. But unless your business IS a Web technology business, keep it small and modest at first. Invest in a good template design, and keep the number of pages down until your business has more of a track record. Newbie business owners lacking clients (and with excess time on their hands) often make the mistake of trying to become the next Huffington Post. Even if youre not spending money, youre spending something just as precious: time. Limit your writing time and put more effort into closing sales. I am not a fan of paid networking or referral groups such as BNI. But if youre considering one, at least hold off joining until you figure out whether you really can benefit from one. Try Meetups instead  they are either free or charge only a nominal fee. With all the free online software services, you should be spending little or nothing at first for these. As your business grows you can selectively upgrade to meet specific needs. Dont get me wrong, PR is valuable. But in the first 6 months youre still figuring out your startups story and how to frame it. Until youve gone through that process dont waste your money or the PR professionals time. Some startups will never get off the ground without investment  but thats not most startups. Unless you are part of the tiny minority with the kind of high-growth business likely to attract investors, or you are planning to buy into a franchise and need the franchise fee, focus on getting customers instead. Raising money is a full-time job in and of itself, and it distracts the founder from other things in the business. For brochures, sell sheets, mailers and other items: prepare and print in small quantities. Invariably you will refine your business and your marketing materials after the first 6 months. You may end up focusing on a narrower niche or revising your pricing. You want to be nimble, not locked in to a 3-year supply. Holding meetings and sales presentations remotely can be valuable. But ll those $24/month expenses for software services can quickly add up to hundreds of dollars monthly. Explore free options that may fit your situation: Google Hangouts, AnyMeeting or OoVoo are 3 possibilities. Try a service like FreeConference.com instead of paying for a conference bridge service. Couple it with Google Talk, and you dont even have to pay long distance charges (calls to phones in the US and Canada are currently free). Just the process of evaluating and choosing software packages can take hours, even days  why get distracted? If its a process improvement type of software and not core to your business, it can wait 6 months. Many vendors offer loyalty program discounts, or discounts provided by official partners of the vendor. Dont buy anything until youve first checked websites of your key vendors to see what offers and programs may be available. If you have an invention that you think could be valuable, run, dont walk, to a patent attorney  not to an invention promotion service. U.S. patent law recently . You could lose rights by not taking the correct steps promptly, and only an attorney can advise you. Filing for a trademark usually doesnt have the same urgency as with a patent. In fact, by consistently using your mark over time you establish stronger rights. In the first six months a trademark registration is not an essential expense. Advertising takes money. Besides, a lot of startups are still figuring out what they are doing in the first 6 months. Instead, ramp up your social media presence during this time. You can connect with your audience and develop more of a two-way dialogue during this time, gaining feedback from your target audience as well. If you must advertise, experiment with low cost alternatives such as Facebook Promoted Posts and Twitter Promoted Tweets. Finally, Id like to also point you to two additional resources: . .","Lots of businesses use Instagram as part of their social media promotions. But now you can actually use Instagram as an e-commerce platform. is a social commerce solution that allows people to buy and sell items directly on Instagram. Co-founders Spencer Costanzo and Braydon Batungbacal developed the service while working on another project. After spending months developing a marketplace app, we were exhausted and looking for ways to quickly scale with no money, Costanzo explained in an email interview with Small Business Trends. We realized that were tons of people selling on Instagram so we brainstormed on how we could leverage that audience, he added. After a few hours we came upon a method that would simplify Instagram commerce, and Spreesy was born. That night we dropped the project that wed spent so many months working on because we felt that we could have far more impact with Spreesy. To use the service, businesses and individuals can sign up with their Instagram account on Spreesys website. From there, they can simply post pictures of their products as they normally would on Instagram. Then anyone on the platform can buy products by commenting on the photos with their email address. Spreesy will send them a bill via PayPal. They pay. And the seller sends out the product. Unlike other online selling platforms, Spreesy charages a flat $15 per month regardless of the number of transactions, the companys website claims. Before Spreesy, businesses could use a similar method to sell on Instagram. But they would have to bill customers manually. And using a more traditional e-commerce method would require customers to actually click a link in the Instagram users profile or perform a Google search. Spreesy doesnt require users to leave Instagram to complete their purchase, which can be a huge benefit since consumers tend to have very short attention spans. Any steps you can take out of the buying process means more potential for sales. So aside from being easy to use, this type of platform could lead to increased sales overall. Batungbacal told Small Business Trends: Spreesy fully enables businesses and individuals using Instagram to sell directly to where their potential customers are the most engaged and receptive.","In this role, the Director of Marketing will be responsible for developing and executing online and print marketing plans.","For now, its probably only important to consumers and large retailers. But theres a faster way to get home delivery of online purchases than Amazon  at least in some cities. The service is called . For a $5 fee, Ebay will deliver merchandise ordered over its Web or mobile Ebay Now platform the same day  often within the hour. To accomplish this, Ebay is working with local retailers in the cities where the service is offered. Ebays local partners offer the merchandise for sale on Ebays platform. Then a courier delivers the merchandise from the local retailer to the customer. Its a new venture for a company up until now associated with online auctions. But it may end up being a real shot in the arm to brick and mortar businesses too. And that could even include small businesses someday. Ebay added Dallas to the list of communities it serves with its same day delivery program this month. The company is touting its service as giving customers an opportunity to shop locally. However, all the partners it is working with so far  Home Depot, Best Buy, Target, Office Depot and Macys to name a few  are national chains, The Dallas Morning News. But it may not be that way indefinitely. In a post on the official Ebay Inc. blog in July, the company : So this suggests local small businesses might also someday be able to offer their merchandise for sale and speedy same day delivery through Ebays new service. Recently Ebay CEO John Donahue called a long-term fantasy, Bloomberg TV . Ebays plans may be a bit far out too. Consider that Ebay has currently launched its new service in five communities  Manhattan and Brooklyn, NYC Queens, the San Francisco peninsula, Chicago and Dallas. Theres a goal of reaching 25 next year. However, the company had hoped to launch the service in Dallas and another city earlier this summer, so roll-out is clearly taking longer than expected. The same may be true of launching partnerships with more than a handful of really big chains. So it could be a while before Ebay works with your business  or even comes to your town.","As anyone doing business on the Web today knows, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is critical.Its the only way to make your online business presence stand out from the hundreds or even thousands of competitors in your niche. Worse yet, the parameters for making your Web presence stand out to the search engines is ever changing, as algorithms are tweaked and tweaked some more and as user habits change in the process. One huge change has been the adoption of mobile. Its a change your business cant afford to ignore. Guess what? It doesnt really matter whether you think mobile is important or not. Search engines have recognized mobile content as critical. They are already working on ways to search that content more effectively. By failing to create content that is optimized for mobile, your Web presence effectively falls behind others who are working to get their content recognized by search engines like Google. In a post on the official Google Webmaster Cental Blog, Webmaster Trends Analyst Pierre Far : So creating content that is optimized for mobile search provides one more way for Google to find your website. Is it an opportunity you can afford to pass up? Redirecting users to the version of your site best suited for their device, be it lap top or mobile, is an important part of optimizing these days.Its important both because it affects user experience and because it impacts how Google sees your site. On the customer side, a recent research study on the official Google Think Insights Blog : Now, lets look at how Google sees things. Redirects help Google understand how your various Web properties are interlinked together. The result is that redirects and user-agent detection are now a part of basic setup for mobile renditions and SEO. The official Google Developers section has these : The search engine supports both HTTP and JavaScript redirects. When it comes to your mobile SEO strategy and optimizing your website for mobile, one good solution is responsive design.Basically, a is one that responds to and resizes itself based on the device of the user. There are a few reasons why Google recommends this approach and why you should consider taking this route: Responsive design approach is the fastest way to go. Redirects can be slow and in the world where nanoseconds count for conversions you should consider avoiding redirects. Its not complicated to share a single URL in social media. One URL is good for SEO. An important aspect of mobile SEO is the experience visitors have when visiting your site via a mobile device. The official Google Developers site has this list of common : If you have separate Web and mobile versions of your site, dont keep it a secret thinking search engines might label it duplicate content and penalize you. Instead, in a guest post on Search Engine Media, Bryson Meunier, director of content solutions at Resolution Media : As with all other aspects of mobile SEO discussed here, consult your Web developer to see how these suggestions can best be put in place on your website. Bottom line: As mobile devices become more and more popular, failure to create a mobile SEO strategy and optimize your site for mobile will put you at a greater and greater disadvantage. Be sure your content is easy to access on every kind of device a visitor might be using. Youll help improve both traffic and customer conversion in the process by bringing more potential customers to you online.","With so many different brands using social media to reach out to customers, it can be difficult to stand out. Some businesses try to use contests, videos, and other special promotions to interact with customers. But those promotions alone cant make or break your social media presence. According to Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley, theres one very simple aspect of social media campaigns that are most likely to make customers take notice  authenticity. When brands interact with customers on social media, its really easy for customers to tell the difference between social media authenticityand companies that are just trying way too hard. Crowley to Inc: That doesnt mean that brands shouldnt be deliberate about the style and tone of their social media posts. In fact, Crowley said that Foursquare found a lot of early social media success by using a playful, flirty tone in its posts. But to make sure that tone comes across as authentic, social media managers need to be able to comfortably interact with customers in a variety of situations. Of course, running a business social media account doesnt just mean scheduling posts with links to products or blog posts. To use it effectively, you also need to respond to customer questions and get involved in conversations about your industry. So social media managers have to be able to easily represent your brand and the tone you want to convey without trying too hard and seeming inauthentic. So if youre trying to use humor in your social media campaigns, the person running your social media needs to be comfortable coming up with jokes and responding to customers in that tone. If that isnt the case, another style might be more suitable for your company. Theres no clear-cut way to ensure social media authenticityto every single customer. But to improve your odds, you should chose a tone that really matches with your brand image, stay consistent with your interactions, and actually talk to customers person-to-person. If you engage in conversations and do so in a comfortable way, theyre more likely to connect with your brand and maybe even do some promoting on your behalf.","Russias FAS anti-trust authority has blocked Google (NSDQ: GOOG) from gaining a foothold in the countrys booming online advertising business. Top-three portal Rambler in July agreed to sell its Begun contextual advertising firm to Google for $140 million. But the authorities on Thursday said Google did not provide all the necessary information to clarify financial aspects of the deal. A translation : (There was) no documented information about individuals that may influence the business group Google, nor a complete list of persons belonging to the group Google, including registered and/or outside Russia. The lack of complete information about the group Google does not fully reflect the effects of the transaction, but may also indicate a limitation of competition due to a decrease in the number of business entities. Its either a cock-up (Google got the paperwork wrong) or a conspiracy (might there be those who wish to keep Russias nascent market for domestic eyes only?). President Putin is reluctant to let the US company dominate Russia as it does elsewhere, a Rambler source told business daily Vedomosti . Either way, its a further regulatory blow to Google, which this month said it would delay its deal to supply ads to Yahoo (NSDQ: YHOO) after all, while DoJ negotiations continue. Thats currently drawing close attention from the department and is likely to get the same from the European Commission. Rambler was due to buy from investor Finam the 49.1 percent of Begun it didnt own, then flog it to Mountain View. Googles now studying the response and considering a re-submission.","Anyone can become an entrepreneur. But some have less access to the education, mentors and resources that can be a huge help in starting a business. Thats why aims to help the youth in low income areas of Oakland, California. Part of the network of co-working spaces around the country, Oaklands Youth Impact program is the first of its kind in the networks more than 60 locations. The program provides guidance and training regarding things like continuing education, job seeking and entrepreneurship. Part of this initiative is the HUBs year-long fellowship program, which teaches social entrepreneurship to youths between the ages of16and24 who face economic barriers. Last year, which was the the programs first, 16 young people were selected based on an application and interview process. They were then matched with business mentors from the community and challenged to create business plans, goals and objectives. At the end of the program, participants had the opportunity to pitch their ideas for the chance to receive seed funding to start their projects. Amanda Greene, co-director of Youth SEED, one of the local organizations that partners with Youth Impact HUB Oakland the Huffington Post: This type of program has the potential to make a huge impact on the Oakland community and its young people. Technology has made entrepreneurship more and more accessible to the young, even those who havent finished or attended college. But there are still a lot of resources that can make starting and running a business a lot easier. And those who live in low-income areas or face other economic barriers could be turned away from entrepreneurship because of those hardships. So programs like the HUB in Oakland can make the dream of starting a business more reachable for those young people. Good ideas arent exclusive to the people who have the resources to make them a reality. So by giving young people more of a chance to make their business ideas happen, a lot more business and social good is possible.","Communications companies like to their businesses.

It is an automated system that: LotusJump searches through thousands of online venues to identify opportunities where you can get a listing for your website; pick up editorially-earned backlinks; get blog and media coverage; network and/or share content on social media sites; and develop online PR and buzz for your brand. If youre thinking of cheap software that automatically submits your website to hundreds of useless, spam-filled directories  ditch that idea right now. This is not that kind of system. Rather, to use LotusJump effectively will require much more of your creativity and smarts. You WILL have to be hands on. But the results will be many times more useful than directory submission software. LotusJump identifies the places where you may be able to get listings or press/blog coverage, submit an article to be published, create an online profile page, etc. Its up to YOU to actually go visit those locales, understand the requirements, and follow through. Its for this reason that LotusJump creates the online to-do list  because youre going to do these activities. To get started, you choose the keywords that are important to your business. Then LotusJump presents a long list of visibility opportunities tailored for those keywords. This will save you many hours of time that you would otherwise have to spend searching for relevant places where you can develop online buzz, or publish an article, or create an online listing, or develop backlinks. The following three steps illustrate LotusJumps process: One of the best features about LotusJump is that its more than just a basic task list. Each task comes with detailed instructions that explain what that task is and how to do it. In these next two screenshots, youll see what I mean. First, in this screenshot (click it to open larger image) you see a partial list of the activities that have been returned for the keyword small business. The list page is easy to scan. You can click on the X to delete anything that looks like it doesnt fit or that you do not want to do. You can pin any items to your to-do list that you definitely decided to tackle (notice the orange push-pin). But what if youre not sure what the task involves? Then in that case you click on the item. It takes you to a detail page that explains more. From there you can make a better judgment as to whether this is a task you actually want to take on. LotusJump offers many benefits, but here are two major ones I want to highlight: With all of its great benefits, there are two small limitations: Again, these are small hurdles, and probably wont slow down your efforts to get found online. LotusJump is great for small business owners who lack: 1) time or expertise to do SEO research and link-building from scratch, or 2) resources to pay an outside SEO firm or individual expert on contract. This is a do-it-yourself service primarily aimed at the SEO beginner/intermediate (which probably includes most small business owners). Could you do some of this yourself without using a service like LotusJump? Absolutely. Would it be as easy, painless, and inexpensive? No. According to Andrew Pincock, CEO, there are some very accomplished search agencies and business owners doing their own SEO who have signed on to use LotusJump, and that speaks volumes about how useful and effective it is. Even if you have a technology person or team on your payroll, you could use this affordable service to organize all the link-building and buzz-building tasks and make that person or team more efficient. With LotusJump you get an affordable research assistant that is constantly searching and filtering online resources for you (and giving you instructions on how to complete them). In summary, LotusJump is for the business owner who wants to improve their online presence, but doesnt know where to start, and cant afford to outsource. If you have some time, initiative and a desire to improve your website rankings and your brands online visibility, then .","If youre a small business owner who prides themselves on keeping up with all the local search blogs, you may now be overwhelmed with all the news regarding Google+ Local pages and the effect it will have on how you market your business online. If youre big on reading blogs, than you may not even know that your business online landscape totally changed last week and you could be left out in the cold. Either way, fear not! Just keep reading to understand all the essentials regarding the new Google+ Local pages; well break it down together. In case you missed it, last week Google announced a new way to . The new way comes in the form of new Google Local+ pages. These are new business profile listings which will and integrate with Googles new social network, Google+. Users can access these pages through Search, Maps, or through the new Local tab within Google+. If you check out any of these new format pages, youll notice they areconsiderably more user-friendly, dynamic, and easier to interact with than pre-existing Google Place pages. Iveheard many experts describe Local+ pages as more attractive and easier-to-use Facebook brand pages and I wouldnt completely disagree. There are certainly similarities. Regardless of how you look at them, your Local+ page is your new Google business profile for your company, housing all important business information. They pages also make use of Googles acquisition of Zagat from last year, replacing star ratings with more complete to give users a better way to evaluate and select local businesses. Youre also able to see who in your Google+ Circles has been to the restaurant so that you can find reviews and ratings directly from them. When a user looks up your business on Google, this page is what they will find. The pages are designed to give business owners a much more social way to interact with consumers, in a way that Place pages simply did not allow. Yes. You should notice that your Google Place page has already been converted to a Local+ page. Google says that to date, 80 million Google Places pages worldwide have already been merged to this new platform. If your page has not been merged yet, its coming. So prepare yourself. Worth noting: According to Google, you will still continue to manage your information (basic information, make updates, respond to reviews, etc) in . That is still your main console. For the time being, you now have Google+ pages that youll need to manage and worry about. However, the time when youll be able to merge your Google+ Business page with your Google Local+ page is coming. In fact, to give you a sense of what it will look like, you can view the listings for select companies below. These are folks Google has worked with to upgrade their listings early so that we could all see what it would look like: Sort of. Google be moving over the reviews on your Place page to your Local+ page, however, unless the user who left the review goes through Googles verification process, all of your reviews will now show up as being from A Google User. Not the best true cue. However, if the user does go through the quick verification process (which Google will prompt them to do), than the reviews will be tied to their Google+ account. Going forward, in order for anyone to leave a review of your business, they must do so from their Google+ account. Okay, so you may not have been wondering about that, but you should. Because this change will impact your visibility on the Web. Unlike the older Google Place Pages, your Local+ business profile WILL be indexed and show up in the search results. That means you will have to think about how youre going to optimize your Local+ page for search to gain higher visibility. The merger of Google+ with Google Place Pages signifies a major change in the handling of local search and how small business owners will have to adjust their attention and marketing efforts. For other accounts of what these Local+ pages mean to your business, you may want to check out insight from these experts: And, as always, when things change again (which they will), well update you.

Microsoft recently changed its pay structure on its mobile Office app. The company had previously required an annual subscription to Office 365 from iPad users who wanted to do any editing or other work within Office using a special iPad Office app. But now, Microsoft is allowing Office users on iPads and most other mobile devices to edit and work in Word documents and other parts of the Office via mobile app for free. So iPad users who downloaded the iPad Office app and paid the annual subscription for Office 365 in order to work in Office from their tablets are in line for a partial, pro-rated refund, PC World . The refund is good news for iPad users who rely on Office for business but dont have a mobile Windows device with which to access it while on the go. Microsoft had been charging $70 a year for a Personal version of Office 365. The Professional version was priced at $100. There are more still only available to those who pay for an Office 365 subscription. The size of the refund will depend upon when an iPad user subscribed and is expected to cover the remainder of the subscription. Refunds can be claimed up until Jan 31, 2015. Venture Beat that the refund offer only applies to customers who purchased Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal subscriptions after March 27. Thats when Office for iPad was launched. The procedure for obtaining a refund depends upon where and how the subscription was purchased. For example, if Offices mobile app and Office 365 subscriptions were purchased through the Office for iPad app, customers will need to contact iTunes support for a refund. On the other hand, if the subscription was purchased through Microsoft or some other third-party provider, it will be necessary to contact Microsoft directly. Refund claims will be vetted and processed in up to eight weeks. The process may take more time if customers need to go through iTunes support. But for iPad users who spent money to access Office through their non-Windows mobile devices, its probably worth pursuing. Especially since now access is being offered for free.","Technology connects people all over the globe.

Many Americans are now turning to what they love to earn income, whether its enough to quit their day job or just a fun way to cover the costs. If you are passionate about a craft or other activity, your money-making opportunities are virtually endless these days. Here are some things to consider as you turn your hobby into cash. To turn an activity into a business, you dont need to reach a certain level of sales or income. To have a business, all you really need is a reasonable expectation that youll make a profit from the activity. As far as the IRS is concerned, you are supposed to report income from whatever source derived. This means that whether you consider something a hobby or a business, if you are making money, you need to report it on your tax return. So the hobby versus business question boils down to how you handle your expenses and what to do if your activity money. For example, lets say you sell hand-knitted goods in your spare time. If you actually lose money from this activity, when you factor in all the related expenses like yarn and marketing, the IRS will let you deduct this loss to offset your other income (i.e. your day job), if your knitting is considered a business. You cannot deduct a loss, if its a hobby. the IRS, an activity is a business if it has made a profit in three of the past five years. Until you have five years under your belt, the IRS will look to see if youre taking the activity seriously and treating it like a business with the primary goal of making a profit. For example, If you are interested in learning more about how the IRS determines a profit motive for a business, you can read the IRS article  ? When youre ready to move your activity beyond a fun pastime, you need to get serious about managing it. For example, youll need a bookkeeping system to log income and expenses. Youll need a business checking account, and possibly a credit card. In addition, you may want to create a separate legal entity, such as a corporation or LLC. Here are five key steps toward launching an official business: Your business name marks the beginning of your new brand. Youll want to choose something thats easy to remember and reflects what your hobby is all about. In addition to checking if the website address for your name is available, youll need to make sure that another business isnt already using the name. First, you should perform a free business name search to make sure your proposed name is available in your state. If it is available, you can take your search to the next level with a free trademark search to check if anyone has filed a trademark for your name. If you incorporate or form an LLC (Limited Liability Company) for your business, your personal assets are shielded from creditor claims against the business. In addition, formalizing your activity as a corporation or LLC helps show the IRS you are serious about the business. If you prefer not to form an LLC or corporation, you can register your business name with the state via a DBA (Doing Business As) filing, also known as a Fictitious Business Name. To distinguish your business as a separate legal entity, youll need a Federal Tax Identification Number (which is also called an Employer Identification Number). Depending on the specific nature of your business, you may be required to get one or more licenses or permits from the state or local government. The most common requirement is the Resale License (also called a Sellers Permit or Resale Permit). You might also need a general business operation license, health department permit, or zoning or home-based business permit. Once you have registered your business and obtained an EIN, you can open a business bank account and accept checks made out to your business name. In addition, a business bank account keeps your personal and business finances separate  a must for Corporations and LLCs. Its exhilarating when you realize that you can turn your favorite hobby into a commercial venture. A smart idea is to test the waters first by starting your new business on a part-time basis. Just remember that whether you are working on the venture part-time or full-time, you need to take the management and administrative tasks seriously if you want the IRS to consider it a business.","Go tell that long tongue liar, go and tell that midnight rider, tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter. Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down. Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down. ~ Johnny Cash inGods Gonna Cut You Down This is one of my favorite Johnny Cash songs, one that speaks to a punishment coming no matter where the bad guys go. Most social media users arent bad guys, but disagreement on behavior and expectations can make the Internet feel like the wild wild west, with inadvertent ramblers who tweet the wrong tweet or gamblers who ignore the legal consequences of a promotion. Moreover traditional legal perspectives are struggling to keep up with nascent social media behavior and technological advances. I can say for analytics the concerns of Do Not Track has forced many advertisers to consider actions to address current legislation that can easily misconstrue analysis intent. A legal expert has now captured the best of legal interpretations of social media. , by Robert McHale, ESQ ( ) with Eric Garulay, will keep you from becoming the social media gambler. The book examines how social media behavior is shaping the legal world, and what your business should do to protect itself. McHale, a founding partner of an IT and intellectual property law firm, brings expertise to full bear in clear language. I requested a review copy from the publisher Pearson when I saw a flier at a Barnes and Noble. The 12 chapters are worth the read for anyone seeking a grounded real-world perspective on social media. McHales approach in works because he operated outside of the advertising world, an environment that has been hyper-stimulated with new tools and applications at every turn. The book offers 12 chapters on varied business uses of social media (all with U.S. interpretation of the law). Each chapter can stand alone for a quick reference and contains easy language that avoids getting too specific while never talking down the reader The result is an actionable book. A good fit for the cautious small business owner willing to jump into social media waters but desiring to know what Internet seas contain potentially rough waves from a legal perspective. Youll learn the cases and interpretations surrounding policies such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Childrens Online Privacy Protect Act, with useful notes and insights abound in each chapter. The key chapters which small business owners will find particularly useful revolve around advertising and employee conduct: According to McHale, people use the words sweepstakes and contest interchangeably, but there is a difference. McHale explains that difference, and potential result from implying an ongoing promotion: Disclosure is the definitive word in this chapter, as FTC guidelines seek to establish a connection between those paid to endorse and the sponsor of the program. Companies need to ensure that background information is not collected in violation of the FCRA. McHale provides an example of a case of 6 mobile background screening apps that received a warning from the FTC. Most notable for those with Facebook concerns is how friending can be questionable: Theres not a deep examination of Do Not Track  the debates center on technical uses of browsers  but Chapter 7s coverage of Social Advertising reminds one of the range of the FTC. CAN-SPAM and the specter of personal identifiable information is explained. Youll have a better discussion with an analytics specialist when examining the impact of tags and analytic solutions. McHale does an excellent job to enlighten overlooked details without scaring you away from social media. The thoroughness is superb, including notes from cases and a thoughtful do/dont chart in the chapters. We learn so much from one another online, but sometimes forget to ask about real world safeguards when it comes to creating online activity such as sweepstakes and establishing internet communities. After reading , youll come away with a more pragmatic view of how to work with people on the Web. Itll be a terrific view, because youll be well equipped to form solid questions that need answers  answers that make a good idea a great one.","Kodaks newest product, the Kodak PixPro SP360, isnt the first action camera on the market but it could be the most unique. The cameras lens shoots a 360 degree perspective. Other devices like the GoPro and even, to an extent, the Polaroid Cube have already venture into super wide angle shooting of this kind. But at 360 degrees, the new Kodak camera may be the widest. Kodaks can go anywhere you go and even places where you cant. The iconic camera company is offering up this latest device for $350. The Pixpro SP360 is clearly an answer to the GoPro. Promotional videos released by Kodak showing off the range of the Pixpro certainly back that assertion. Heres one example: Cameras like the GoPro, and even the Polaroid Cube are marketed mostly as a solution for capturing action sports, especially from unique and first-person perspectives. But they could likely also be helpful tools for your small business. Obviously, the Kodak Pixpro SP360 would be a great way to make promotional videos for extreme or outdoor businesses like ski resorts, skydiving services, skateboard parks, or maybe even guided tour services. But wouldnt they also be interesting for online video tours of plants or other business locations or make real estate property videos a bit more interesting? The video the camera captures is a full 1080p HD, according to from Kodaks website. There are several modes or shooting angles in which video can be captured, including panoramic shots. But theKodak Pixpro SP360 camera shoots still photos, too. The camera has a 16-megapixel MO Sensor that produces 10-megapixel photos. The still photo feature can capture photos at 10 frames per second, making multiple shots from an action sequence possible. And the camera can also be used to capture time-lapse photos. Whether shooting videos or stills, the Pixpro SP360 has a corresponding Android and iOS app that allows users to control the camera from a smartphone or tablet. The camera is less than two inches tall, wide, and long with a camera lens that looks like an eye sitting atop a small box. Kodak says a single battery charge allows users to shoot about 350 still shots or about 160 minutes of video.","The ingenuity of inventors never ceases to amaze me. Whether its Post It notes, zippers or velcro, our lives have been greatly influenced by inventors and their inventions. But how does a modern inventor get their product to market? There are several ways. For the inventor who wants to keep as much of the profits as possible, selling direct is the way to go. However, selling on your own website can be hard. Here is a sample of all the things youll encounter: As you can see, this can be a bit overwhelming. However, there are ways to simplify the process. There are a lot of different platforms out there and they vary in how they work and the level of control you have. Craigslist and eBay are very simple ways to list a product and make sales. If you want more of a store you can go with a site like Etsy or Cafepress that gives you control over the layout and styling. Whichever platform you choose you can usually avoid the hassle of setting up your own website and they will usually have a built-in payment system. The downside to these options is that you still need to drive traffic to your listings or store. If youre not particularly marketing minded, this can still seem overwhelming. So whats even easier? The easiest way to get your invention to market is to license it to an existing company. Theyll handle production, sales and fulfillment and give you a percentage of each sale. While licensing deals can be structured many ways, the inventor usually keeps the patents and rights to the invention. So how does one get a licensing deal? There are a few methods:","As Jonathan Davids, founder of influencer marketing platform Influicity recently explained to Small Business Trends contributor Brent Leary, YouTube is becoming an important .

With the recent app store announcement from Google, combined with the phenomenal growth of iPad sales, its understandable. (To learn whats out there, see a great list of from Shara Karasic). Yet even after creating a working app, your work is not done. You must market the app along with your website, not to mention maintaining a social media presence. Doing it all can be a daunting task. Enter , a short guide in the Que Biz-Tech book series, written by Jeffery Hughes. Hughes is an application developer and Associate Professor at the University of Vermont. This guide offers some surprising ways to strategically offer an app for a growing business. A number of application development books have been brought to market, but is worth reading first. In its effort to provide marketing tips, it also provides valuable guidance on the steps to take starting app development. Example: it includes a graphic layout to explain and remain focused on the apps purpose. It offers specific to-dos that can showcase an app, all of them within reach for a small business. One great segment is about pricing. Hughes cautions business people not to expect their app to be successful simply because it is cheap: In another segment, Hughes compares the economic cost of creating an app in-house to paying a service to build it for you. A segment on app promotion with respect to budget is brilliantly explained, as are discussions on considering target audiences for app usage. Hughes presents plenty of tips and ideas that can be followed in sequence for a newbie or experienced developer. But even if you jump around when reading the book, you wont get the sense of missing a needed step. A few analytics tools are recommended, namely Flurry and Mobelix. I have not tried either, so I not sure of their effectiveness. Regardless, I am certain more solutions will come on the market. The book covers some noteworthy tactics. Most are eye-opening, although others may already be familiar to those with a lot of app marketing experience. A SWOT overview is used to determine how to position an app, but you may rethink the advice if the app is a part of a grander business strategy. Hughes ends with a segment on the potential benefits and pitfalls of releasing an app  a reminder that you need some solid reading (like this book) before marching off to build that dream app. Overall, is certainly a useful guide. As of this writing it is one of the few dedicated to app marketing. Even though some tips may be familiar to old webheads and seasoned marketers, business owners who barely understanding scripting language and online marketing will appreciate the tips regarding Web copy and online benchmarking. They serve as reminders of the importance of integrating each marketing step into the development and launch of your app. To pack an even greater punch, you may also want to pick up a sales book along with this one. Combine ideas for best results. The advice and tactics on pricing could easily complement ). If you are working to develop a website, combine this book with ), which discusses Web design in laymans terms. You may come up with ideas on website layout that will enhance marketing the app as well as your product or service. Further still, you may want to read Hughes book in conjunction with a social media guide, such as ) or ). That way you can expand your social media strategy to encompass promoting your app. It should be noted, Hughes also wrote an Android app version of this book. There are some similarities in suggestions and approach. But no matter which app for which device, you certainly will be well on your way to a great start to enhancing your online presence.","Do we need some kind of permission to be creative? To live and do business outside the box? I mean, its not that small business creativity has to be so wild and far outit just has to . I meet a lot of small business owners who deal with creativity as an afterthought. Well, just because our companies are small doesnt mean our ideas and our solutions have to be tiny, too. Of course, creativity and innovation dont have to be over the top, either. Fast Company just came out with their . Its a diverse list with dynamic stories that inspire me (and hopefully you, too). Whether you are designing a physical product, redefining a company, writing stories and jokes, or figuring out a new way to communicate your political or corporate message, its the creativity that makes a company, a brand, an idea stand out. And creativity works for small businesses too. In the beginning every business a small business, so why should we act like creativity is something for the big boys?From some of my favorites on the list, I learned a few things that we can use in our businesses. Musician Bruno Mars, No. 48 on the list, keeps a production team around him. When he gets song ideas, he gathers the trio and the three of them make music. Each small business has a rhythm of its own. Identify key creative team members and carve out some space for the ideas to bounce around the team. Thats how Tiny Prints (Laura Ching, No. 60 on the list), an online stationery company, took off. The team was already in place, meeting weekly and just looking for a great idea. We cannot do it by ourselves. It takes a (dynamic) team to build our small businesses and make them last. Educator , No. 7 on the list, created Khan Academy, a video library for students. According to its About page, the academys goal is to provide a free world-class education for anyone anywhere. While Khan Academy is a nonprofit and by nature mission-driven, its no different for for-profit businesses. We are all driven by a mission of some kind; our companies should be too. Define the core problem you solve, the people you solve it for, the process you use to get it done and how you could improve on it. Use your team to put it all together. Plan out your best ideasand then leave room for change. Comedian , No. 8 on the list, has a staff of writers, and he constantly reviews and rewrites what they provide. Even after they hash everything out, he may change it and add to it on the air. Preparation is powerful, but so is having the guts to make the right kinds of changes. Prepare ahead of time, but leave some space to read your audience (your customers) and adjust to the moment. Oprah Winfrey, No. 12 on the list, sits among 12 oak trees in her yard for inspiration, while Arianna Huffingtons (No. 10) ideas come from naps. Conans inspiration seems wild and overwhelming to me, but it works for him. Find your inspiration and let it work for you. Its creativity that solves the problems that others will not and/or cannot. Its the systematic way of protecting creativity that allows you to build a business around it. Speaking of systems, Conan debriefs after every show to see what works, and the Middle East media outlet Al Jazeera ( , No. 1 on the list), has an online system in place that allows citizens to submit content about whats happening in their country. Its good to make room for creativity and to set up systems that maximize all the voices and ideas around you.","Are VCs outdated? And is a bank loan really necessary for many businesses to start? Given the rise of Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and other online funding platforms, one begins to wonder what shifts await traditional sources of business financing. Kevin Lawton and Dan Morom, authors of the book, , have a few ideas. Lawton has founded multiple startups, while Morom is a finance PhD candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I sought a review copy through NetGalley; Its a second edition published through McGraw Hill, where the first was self published. The books publication history is not lost irony on the subject matter. Significant computing capability, widespread internet access, and digital media has rearranged value for publishers and media producers. A similar impact is happening in finance. Lawton and Morom believe we have reached a critical shift in how funding should work. They dont believe VCs are entirely pass, but do note that: That perspective means that traditional business resources such as a board of directors should be rethought to be effective for a more varied and global entrepreneurial audience. The book is peppered with a few terrific factoids  didnt know Vermont had revised its legislation to create a start up environment competitive with Delaware and Nevada. It also explains technological trends that can make or break platforms, such as APIs: Rightly noting that APIs are making applications go around, the authors highlight benefits that small business owners will appreciate. Readers will not learn a step by step process. Instead, they will learn what aspects of crowdsourcing platforms should be present when deciding where to invest participation. Creative trends are also highlighted, such as a finder economy that connects entrepreneurial efforts with funding sources. A wider discussion on the impact of such an economy is probably left best for a webinar  but the topics inclusion, along with an example in the platform FundHamony, reflects very advanced thinking compared to many social media books on the shelf (or with ebooks, on the server). The authors even note a crowdfunding due diligence company. Touches like that show Lawton and Morom researched the right potential questions readers would wonder about. Refreshingly pokes at venture capital thinking without relying on hackneyed commentary easily trolled and copied from any ole blog. Take this quote about video: When video is contrasted against powerpoints, the authors subtly position a recent successful platform, YouTube, against a typical presentation method, the roadshow. The book is a clear compliment to and although readers of The Mesh may want to read this as a follow up book ( still remains one of my favorites in providing start up examples). A good read during a company downtime or when researching a startup. The Crowdfunding Revolution offers fundraising inspiration for small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs.","Ever since the phrase viral video became part of the English lexicon, business owners have been excited about the idea of having one. After all, what business owner or marketing manager wouldnt kill for a video featuring his product thats seen and shared by millions of people? If youre one of those business owners, there are a couple of things you need to know before you get too excited about the idea of creating a viral video. Have you noticed that there arent many viral videos featuring products and services? Thats because there arent many. It doesnt mean they cant go viral, it just means they usually dont. Theres a good reason why most viral videos are about things like turtles crossing a highway at rush hour. Those videos happen because the right video device was in the hands of the right person at just the right moment in time. In a word  luck. One of the few viral videos that was about a product was created by a blender company called Blendtec. Blendtec makes very powerful professional blenders. So, to demonstrate that, they created a series of videos of all kinds of crazy things being blended  golf balls, iPhones, Barbie dolls, etc. Of course the crazier it was, the more views it got and it became a viral sensation. What people dont realize is that this successful viral campaign was never created with the intention of going viral. It was created with the sole intention of effectively and creatively demonstrating the product benefit and selling Blendtec blenders. The problem with the mentality of intentionally trying to create a viral video is that it places the emphasis on the wrong thing  being wacky or outrageous versus effectively selling the product. As a result those videos tend to be really bad. Often, embarrassingly bad. So, not only are they not seen and shared by tons of people, but the people who do see them often get turned off to the product being sold. That said, most Web videos are totally boring. The people behind them fail to realize that its not just about communicating the right information, its about doing it in a way that quickly gets attention, engages the viewer, and ultimately persuades them to take the desired action. The challenge is coming up with a big, smart, creative idea that does that.","Welcome to the series of pre-conference interviews with select speakers from the upcoming Affiliate Management Days San Francisco 2013 (Apr 16-17, 2013). In this interview, my guest is , CEO of , famous conversion optimization expert,entrepreneur, author and keynote speaker. At the #AMDays conference, Chris will cover conversion optimization techniques and tactics and how they may be used to help improve performance of affiliate programs. * * * * * Affiliate managers are still under-emphasizing conversion optimization. A recent study of online retailers revealed that, for every $92 spent driving traffic, still only $1 spent on conversion. With under-investment like this, theres no wonder why affiliate websites and landing pages are still under performing. But, many are coming to their senses. The same study showed that the top challenge for retailers this year is improving conversions. Theyre taking the first step; at least they admit they have a problem. The rationale for conversion optimization is well known. It is much easier to boost your profit by improving your web conversion rates than it is to drive more affiliate traffic. What if you could get 10%, 20% or 50% more conversions from the same traffic? Would that be worth your time? Social media is still in its growth stage but its activity will have to pay off directly this year, especially for affiliate managers. Affiliates are well positioned to take advantage of their action oriented approach to the web by looking for opportunities that arise from and the inevitable scramble that platforms are going to make to secure a place in social video. Content marketing is still growing, but business leaders are starting to hold it with a shorter leash. Theyre realizing that content without conversion is just free publishing. The effort has to pay off more directly. Your social campaigns need to be optimized for conversions. I take a very different approach than previous books. Im less concerned with showing technical details of how to use analytics tools or in promoting untested theories. I want to show how to get real results. And these are not the same old tips you can find in a Google blog search. The book takes a balanced approach with proven strategic frameworks for elevating the discussion above tips and tactics as well as hands-on advice and tested discoveries. It also includes 15 full case studies from real companies, showing exactly how they got results. I think Neil Patel, co-founder of KISSmetrics, and Crazy Egg, said it best when he said: I support his recommendation. The most important finding from the thousands of test results weve studied is this: principles and frameworks are more effective than tips and tactics. Marketers who are still looking for silver bullet ideas on the latest blog post are missing out on much bigger wins. If, instead, you start with a proven scientific process that includes strong conversion analysis frameworks, youll develop a consistent stream of ideas and improvements. Thats what weve been developing since 2007  reliable conversion optimization frameworks. A great place to start is the LIFT landing page analysis framework, which you can use to identify and categorize conversion problems. Our strategists still use it every day with WiderFunnels clients. Using a framework like the LIFT Model will focus your attention on meeting the prospects needs rather than just trying random tactics. Ill tell you exactly which words will work best. Theyre the words that: The specific words that meet those criteria will depend on each context, target audience, incoming media source and product. In my session at AM Days, I show specific case study examples. You see how companies with successful affiliate programs have boosted their conversion rates by finding the words, images, designs and value proposition that works best. * * * * * The takes place April 16-17, 2013.

It has plans to sign up one million (ten lakh) enterprises in three years, a target that came about purely because of the tenacity of Sridhar Vembu, Founder, Zoho Corp, and his team. Sridhar has a large fan-following in the industry, which seemed to have created a mythical narrative around the man for turning down venture capital money. One of the interesting stories is that the domain name Zoho originally belonged to a US-based hospitality startup that had raised $53 million in 1999 to scale up. Unfortunately, the fairy tale story of great valuations turned out to be a nightmare for this hotel , which went into liquidation in 2000-01. Sridhar and his team loved the domain name and picked it up from the court that was handling the liquidation process. The domain cost Sridhar an expensive $5000, in the year 2004, and it turned out the best decision his team had made. They used the domain to launch a suite of office products for the parent company, AdventNet Technologies. Sridhar rebranded the company as Zoho Corp by 2010. The rest was history. Sridhar Vembus company is now one of the fastest growing companies, which is prepared for a world where software will be the business driver for every organisation. Be it in networks, smart offices or smart factories Zoho believes software will change IT businesses forever with subscription-based business models uprooting licence fee-based business models of proprietary software. Currently, Zoho is experimenting with over 100 different ideas and has seeded four productivity tools  Zoho Writer, App-Creator, Notebook and Gamescope  each of which helps an enterprise deploy IT rapidly in the organisation. Readily deployable IT is the future, says Sridhar. But there is more to Zoho than just productivity tools for the office. Its Manage Engine software suite manages network nodes of enterprises, and its WebNMS is building Internet of Things (IoT) applications for industry. Being an IT veteran, Sridhar believes in the B2B business should focus on building businesses without any funding, and they should learn to make customers pay for the services they deliver. He also believes a bigger global financial meltdown is around the corner and that funding could dry up soon. Here are the excerpts of the interview: I am confident we can achieve it. Organisations are moving a lot of applications to the cloud. We are a company that is known for office applications and we see many small businesses that are going to use our products. A lot of medium-sized enterprises are moving to the cloud too, and they can use our applications with minimum support and implementation. The cost of IT is going to drop. Consumerisation of IT is the future and it will be about readily deployable apps and automation. The old world of IT, which is about large-scale implementation, is going to go through a rapid transformation. Most of our products are digitally marketed and word of mouth wins new customers for us. . Each time, in 2000 and in 2008, we had enough cash to work on new technology areas. In 2000, we served the telecom as our major clientele. When the industry collapsed we had to use our internal accruals to build new network management technologies for enterprises across verticals. Similarly, in 2008, a lot of businesses went into cost-saving mode and began to experiment with our products, because even at the low price we offered quality. It served the needs of enterprises because proprietary software remained inefficient to catch up with the world facing a financial crunch. In 2000, we self-funded our growth; the second time around  in 2008  we had the products that were accepted by the market. Now we are ready for the future, which is going to be about mobiles and changing IT architectures. I will never go to a VC. In fact, I was given a term sheet in 1999. But a clause put me off. The clause said that I must go for an IPO or generate liquidity in eight years. I did not know finance back then, but my mind kept saying that this clause is just not right. However, that is a standard clause for all VCs and everyone signs it. My point is that the whole construct is questionable and not glued to reality. The philosophy of taking somebodys money and promising them what they want looks like a gamble to me. So, like a good man, I said no to the money. But, at the time, I was termed arrogant by the VC and he left the office fuming. It was a good decision because today I can experiment with technology and invest 50 percent of my money in R&D without having someone telling me where I should put my money. That said, many VC company founders are my friends. I respect that theirs is a different philosophy and it is their view of building companies. Now, I have shown everyone that sometimes you do not need VC money. Deep down I think Google and Apple would know that after a certain scale you do not require to go public. I must advice startups that you need partners or investors who will stay invested with you for life and help build great technology. I have invested in four companies and the founders share a common vision of building long-lasting businesses. These startups are in the areas of core technology. I am open to ideas in my organisation, which is why we have every team working with an idea that can become a product. Failures are good and experimenting is a key to success. Thats how most of our products in Zoho were born. As a leader, I believe in being fluidic. Indian culture has been a fluidic culture and it teaches us to accept so many changes. For example I am Tamil, but I can also speak English. My company is global and yet I have not forgotten my cultural roots. I say English is important for economic growth, but one should also know everything about his or her culture. I relate this to dynamic leadership because it enables me to understand and accept people across borders. Just to illustrate this concept. Ten percent of my young engineers are from Bihar and this number is only increasing. Now, I am learning Hindi because I want to be able to communicate with my new hires. The mark of a leader is to learn constantly and understand different people without being troubled by their expectations. I think Indian philosophy and global history has enough examples of preparing leaders for running global companies. You have many Indian global CEOs; the same cannot be said about many other Asian countries. Manage Engine is still a large business by value. But the Zoho suite of products will grow faster. The Manage Engine business is for large telecom vendors who want software to manage switches, nodes, printers and other access points of an enterprise. It enables them to figure out the downtime and availability of nodes. The delivery of this product will also eventually move to the cloud as enterprises begin to share their APIs to deliver such service. The WebNMS business is about preparing firmware of the future, which can then be implemented with device manufacturers for an IoT play. IoT, as you know, has many applications in the connected world. This was one thing that no enterprise predicted. In 2007, when the first iPhone was out, I was invited to a conference and almost everyone in that room had the iPhone. That changed the entire ecosystem of services on the mobile. Today, this small device can control large machines. Software is the business today and business is defined by the power of software. Today, our mobile device management application for enterprises is a popular product. Our suite of office productivity apps and the CRM have all moved mobile. By the way, building a mobile app is not about replicating the web world to a mobile form. It is about an entire new platform that has its own dynamics of user interface and performance. The problem is over-leverage. The worlds debt is high. India is lucky because of the RBI managing the economy. Over-spending by consumers and high leverage on the enterprise side is the problem. Part of the larger problem is that the private funds bloat up valuations of everything in a short period and then when they leave markets, during a downturn, there are social ramifications. Loss of jobs and cultural identity is a reality that we have to get used to. Look at India, the growth is happening in four or five major cities. The opportunities are not trickling down. Although Indias domestic consumption economy is what everyone is betting on, the financial world is clearly global. The central banks have no control over foreign capital. The Indian central bank has done a wonderful job of reining in debt by not lowering rates. I think companies have to be frugal and conserve cash. But they seldom do because they embark on building swanky offices and spending on promotions. I can give you an example of a startup that spent $35 million on rentals per year. Now, for a 1,000-employee organisation this roughly can be estimated to about $25,000 per employee as rental cost. It is insane and worrisome.","    Taj Mansingh Hotel situated in Lutyens Delhi towards the southwest of India Gate is one of the rare examples of Mughal architecture in the city. Constructed entirely out of pink Dholpur sandstone and set amidst a garden, Taj Mansingh is an epitome of luxury and indulgence and while a lot of people dream of actually living in this five-star property, one man actually made that very wish come true- that too for 37 years.  Meet Dadi Balsara , the Parsi businessman who had lived in Taj Mansingh Hotel for a whopping 36 years- becoming Taj Mansingh Hotel's long-standing guest until he passed away in 2014 at the age of 71.  Balsara and his wife Christina Stone (who passed away in 2009) both made the Room no 901, one of Taj Mansingh's luxury suite their home and lived and loved the hotel as his own. The couple had no children.  According to hotel sources, Balsara never felt the need of buying a house in the city as he considered Taj Mansingh as his home and the hotel staff his extended family. He not only knew the hotel like the palm of his hand, but was also incredibly close to the staff. In the course of his 36-year-long stay, he had grown close to a valet who was considered more of Balsara's personal aide, rather than a hotel staffer.  He was also the first member of the Taj InnerCircle loyalty programme. The hotel staff also talked of how co-operative Balsara was.      ""Whenever we would have a VIP guest- such as the Prime Minister or President of some country staying with us, who wanted the floor to be cleared- we would inform of him of the same and he would promptly comply with their wishes and would return only when the guest had left the hotel.""  Infact, it was Balsara who had set up the largest natural mineral water plant in Dhaula Kaun in Himachal Pradesh in with an investment of $20 million and created the niche Himayalan mineral water brand. Manufactured by his Mount Everest Mineral Water Limited , he ensured that Himayalan stands out in the highly competitive bottled water segment in the country.  And, as luck would have it, taking his association with the hospitality brand one step closer, he sold off his priced asset, the Himalayan brand to none other than the Tata Group in 2007. This marked Tata Global Beverages foray into the Indian packaged water segment.  Contrary to popular belief, Balsara was not born a billionaire. He was born into a family of modest means and began his career as an LIC officer in Nagpur, earning a meager salary of Rs 600. He later went on to the US to study psychiatry on a scholarship and started his own practice after obtaining a doctorate.  Unfortunately, he was forced to look at other career options when his practice failed as hardly anyone turned up for a consultation. His big break came when a Japanese television channel decided to host his 'holistic lifestyle' programmes which as time passed became a roaring success and finally money started to roll in.  It was only uphill from there. Balsara later settle in Singapore where he earned the title of 'Perfumes king of Asia' by selling perfumes. In 1991 he decided to come back to India and settled in Delhi.  With a business empire spread across 63 countries, Balsara was one of the richest NRI at the time of his death. He reportedly had Rs 250 crore in his bank account.","Over a decade has passed since the series finale aired, but Friends continues to be one of the most relevant television shows, with teenagers binging episodes on Netflix and media-trained Disney stars of today naming it as their favorite show . So given its continued popularity, theres a decent chance that, even in 2016, you still have a stake in the most heartbreaking thing to happen on the show  when Phoebe ( Lisa Kudrow ) and David( Hank Azaria )didnt end up together. After David decided to go to the Belarus capital city Minsk for his career, Phoebe married Mike ( Paul Rudd )  a fine choice  but it was still a sad end for the science-loving, glasses-wearing character. Well, perhaps it comes as even more tragic news that it wasnt even supposed to be that way. In a recent interview with Azaria about his Emmy nomination for a role in Ray Donovan,The Huffington Post asked the actor what the Minsk happened. And apparently ... Responding to whether he knew it would be the end of Davids arc when he went to Minsk, Azaria told HuffPost, No, I didnt know that was the end of David. The plan always was kind of to bring him back. David does return in a small capacity on the show, but Azaria specifically meant that he was under the impression Phoebe and David would end up together. I think, honestly, what happened was Paul Rudd is so awesome that they sort of found a groove with him and [my character] became more of just the grist for that mill, said Azaria, who added, As opposed to the other way around. Was the actor as upset as his character to lose out to Paul Rudd? It actually did sting a little bit, said Azaria. Whatever part of me is David the science guy who went to Minsk, which admittedly is probably a small part of me [ laughs ],but that part of me wanted to end up with Phoebe. So I was sort of sad when I didnt. Conceding that Rudd was just too charismatic to keep off the show, the actor said with a laugh, He certainly has gone on to prove that he was comedically deserving of Phoebes love. Azaria did feel Rudd might be too good-looking, though. Hes a handsome devil.Hes actually annoyingly handsome.He shouldnt really be allowed to be that handsome. Hes like the Tom Brady of comedy.

Both the New York Times and Twitter were hacked yesterday. Or, at least, their domain names were hacked  i.e., hijacked for a time. The two companies essentially had their domain names rerouted to different servers. In the case of the New York Times, it was the entire NYTimes.com web URL that was affected. In the case of Twitter, it was only the domains for the images hosted on Twitter. A group claiming to be loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad claimed responsibility in a series of messages on Twitter. The group, calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), also claimed to have hacked the Huffington Post, but that site does not appear to have been affected. The SEA hacking attack was relatively low-tech (as such things go). It started with a phishing email. The email enticed an employee of a reseller of Melbourne IT in Australia to give up login credentials. Melbourne IT provides online DNS services for The New York Times website, Twitter and many other clients. Typically, a phishing email tries to get unsuspecting recipients to click on a link taking them to a fake page that may look exactly like a legitimate site. Upon logging in, the login credentials are captured. Once the SEA had the login credentials, they were able to gain access to the DNS records for the New York Times website. They then changed the records to point to a different server. When visitors went to the NYTimes.com site, they saw a screen with an SEA insignia. Thats because the DNS information was directing Internet traffic to go to the substituted server location for information, not to the New York Times Web servers. , DNS is akin to a phone book for the Internet and is responsible for taking you to the website that you want to visit. Although Melbourne IT changed the DNS information back promptly after the intrusion was discovered, the effects lingered. The reason: it can take up to 24 hours for your ISPs caches to be cleared of information. Almost a full day later, some people (including here at the Small Business Trends offices) were still not able to access the New York Times website. Up until nearly noon Eastern time today, New York Times Vice President of Communications, Eileen Murphy, was on Twitter from readers who said they could not access the site. The DNS tampering also affected Twitter to a lesser degree. The SEA managed to access the DNS records for where Twitter images are hosted (although not the main Twitter servers). Twitter issued an saying Viewing of images and photos was sporadically impacted. Be wary of unexpected emails that seem to come out of the blue prompting logins. Look closely at the URL for any page you are directed to. Sometimes the pages look perfect, and only the URL is a giveaway that its a phishing site. Make sure employees are trained to watch out. Small businesses typically have their domain name registrar manage their DNS. If someone gains access to your domain name account, they may be able to tamper with where your website traffic is pointed to. While domain registrars usually require multi-step security for transferring a domain name, that may not be the case for changing DNS settings. Protect login credentials carefully.","HP is taking the the big, bulk desktop computers and shrinking them. At CES 2015, the and the Stream Mini.

From showrooming worries to mcommerce trends, small retailers and e-tailers have a lot of issues to keep up with these days. A new study from Shopzilla that polled Internet users about their online shopping habits has some useful insights. Below is some of what they found. In terms of advertising and marketing outreach, store emails were the top driver of online sales (11 percent), beating out magazine ads (8 percent), blogs or online content sites (4 percent), and Facebook (2 percent) in this regard. However, impulse buys are a bigger factor than any type of advertising or marketing. Nearly one-third of customers say they ran across their most recent purchase while surfing the Web,25 percent say they found it after they went looking for a specific item, and 8 percent say they saw it while out and about shopping. One place employees arent shopping is at workjust 17 percent of purchases were made from the office, while 70 percent were made at home. In terms of device, the vast majority of online sales (85 percent) still take place on a desktop computer. iPads ranked second, with 11 percent of overall purchases taking place on an iPad (fewer than 1 percent of sales were made on any other type of tablet). For those with household incomes of $150K and above, 20 percent of purchases were made on an iPad. Despite lots of mcommerce hype, mobile phones are still just minimal contributors to online salesless than 5 percent of sales were made on any type of smartphone. (Ive seen other surveys that show much higher usage of mobile phones for shopping.) The good news for retailers is that more than 50 percent of consumers feel confident about spending. Overall, 28 percent feel free to spend, and 31 percent expect to spend more than they did in the previous month. That doesnt mean consumers are throwing money around, however. Price remains a huge factor, with 75 percent of shoppers saying price influenced their purchases, and 79 percent reporting they bought from the site offering the best price. Six in 10 bought items on sale, more than half (54 percent) ordered from sites that offer free shipping, and 33 percent used coupons. Showrooming (looking at a product in-store, then buying it from a competitor online) isnt an issue for most online shoppers since the majority (78 percent) never bother to look at the product in a store before buying. Only 12 percent see a product in a store, then buy from that store or its website. Just 10 percent look at the product in-store before if someplace else. Since shoppers are often influenced by something they see online while looking for something else, consider adding suggestions to your ecommerce site (such as displaying related or complementary items in the sidebar while customers are shopping), making suggestions for additional purchases during the checkout process, or serving ads related to shoppers past browsing history when they leave your site. Clearly, the iPad is a major contender when it comes to mobile shopping. Particularly if you target upscale consumers, its crucial to develop a tablet-optimized ecommerce site. If you have a retail store without an ecommerce component, look into ways to use tablets in your store, such as by providing additional information about your inventory to shoppers or enabling mobile payments to speed checkout. Among the marketing strategies you can use, email marketing matters the most. However, with shoppers rarely surfing shopping sites during work hours, timing your emails for evenings and weekends, or right before the lunch hour, is most likely to yield maximum results.","  If all goes well, Tesla would soon start rolling out its slick cars from the Indian lands.  As per an announcement by transport minister Nitin Gadkari , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended an invitation to Tesla to set up its manufacturing hub for South and South East Asia in the country.  Gadkari visited Tesla's factory in San Francisco, where he announced this step from Modi. As per Gadkari, the offer included allocating land to the carmaker near major Indian ports so that exports can be made easier.  On his trip, Gadkari also offered to promote JVs between Tesla and Indian automobile companies, which could result in pollution-free road transport in India if the makers focus on electric and battery-powered commercial and public vehicles.  It was last year that Modi had visited Tesla's factory in Fremont, CA when he had visited the US tour, guided by CEO Elon Musk himself.

I am going to tell you how I use the free, non-business version of Evernote to keep blog posts flowing and the blogs I write for active. As you are reading this, keep in mind that you can use the items you save in Evernote for research and ideas for upcoming articles. But you can also use the items you save directly in articles. I am going to explain how you can do this. Evernote is a free tool that allows you to save basically anything that you are interested in. You can save URLs for images, articles, videos, images, infographics and anything else that has a URL. Evernote essentially clips an excerpt of information from a web page and the items you clip are organized. You can login to Evernote from any computer. There are extensions for the browsers you use and there are apps for mobile devices. Basically, you can get to your saved information from anywhere. In Evernote you can create notebooks (basically categories) and you can tag whatever you save/clip with keywords so you can search your notebooks easily later. The best way to start using Evernote is to create notebooks/categories for the subjects you are interested in writing about. Some examples: By saving good articles, you always have a way to find great information when writing new articles. You also avoid that, Where did I read that? problem. It is important to tag articles in any way that can help you sift through articles or web pages later. Once you have 50 articles on blogging, for example, it might be easier if you could just find the articles related to services only. I also suggest tagging with the year of the article so you can determine if information is old or new. Sometimes recaps can be a great way to share information. Recaps can be on any topic and they are often a collection of educational information for the reader. Lets say you work in Excel all the time and you research ways to create things, like pivot tables. Perhaps you want to create a collection of how to articles for your readers. If you have saved the educational articles you have read in Evernote you can just go in and search for Excel and see a list of articles that might be good for your readers. It is easy to create a recap post this way. As you read, you can save articles you think are great for recap posts. You can even tag them with something like recap Google analytics.  When the time comes you can have all the articles you need in one place. I personally clip anything I find that is useful to me or could be for my clients or my readers. When I need a recap post, I have tons of articles to choose from. When you find something great, remember the possibility of recaps and tag accordingly. There are many items out there that you can use in your blog posts to supplement the information you already provide. To be totally honest, there are times that I have nothing to write about or I just dont have time to write a long blog post. So I dig into things I have saved in Evernote to help me out. I have categories for infographics, videos and . Most of the time, items like these just need an intro paragraph or two and I have a blog post. Evernote can be an amazing backup tool for writers that have no time or have writers block. Blogging is not easy and keeping a blog active is not easy. If you are responsible for keeping a blog going, I suggest you take advantage of the free version of Evernote. Create a library of information that you think is important and could be helpful to you. Find a way to collect items that will help you with blogging. Whether it be ideas or items to use. You cant remember everything so let Evernote remember for you. I use it daily and it has helped me with blog posts more than I could ever explain. I hope it can help you too.

PMKVY will impart fresh training to 60 lakh youths and certify skills of 40 lakh persons acquired non-formally under the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). The target allocation between fresh trainings and RPL will be flexible and interchangeable depending on functional and operational requirements, an official statement said. The scheme, completely aligned to the common norms as notified earlier, would move to a grant based model where the training and assessment cost would be directly reimbursed to training providers and assessment bodies in accordance with the Common Norms. Financial support to trainees will be given in the form of travel allowance, boarding and lodging costs. Post placement support would be given directly to the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). Disbursement of training cost to training partners will be linked to Aadhaar and biometrics for better transparency and targeting. Skill training would be done based on industry led standards aligned to the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF). In view of the recommendations of the sub group of chief ministers on skill development regarding the need to address the unique skill requirements of different states, state governments would be involved through a project based approach under the PMKVY 2016-20 with 25% of the total training targets, both financial and physical, being allocated under this stream of the scheme. The financial amount/budget for achieving 25% of the total training targets of next phase of PMKVY would be directly allocated to the States.","Freelancing has become a over the last few years. And it doesnt appear to be going away anytime soon. While more businesses are realizing the benefits of employing freelance workers, more individuals are finding contract work to either supplement or replace their traditional jobs. And although freelancers can usually work from anywhere, some places are definitely more freelancer friendly than others. , a provider of tax and insurance tools for freelance workers, recently of the top cities for freelance workers, based on several different factors. Despite this citys high housing cost and tax rate, it has the highest percentage of self-employed individuals of any major city in the country. That means freelancers there have access to collaboration with others through coworking spaces and other freelancers in the area. has the second highest percentage of self-employed workers. And with slightly lower income tax rates and housing costs than those in L.A., it makes for a great option for freelance workers too. This Texas city doesnt have quite as high of a self-employment rate. But doesnt collect income taxes from residents and boasts fairly low health insurance rates and housing costs. This citys low unemployment rate of 4.2 percent, paired with below average housing and health insurance costs, make a fine choice for independent workers. Like Houston, doesnt collect income taxes from residents. And it also has decent rates for insurance and housing, along with a respectable self-employed community, 7.2 percent of the population. The low cost of health insurance and income taxes top the list of reasons makes the list of best cities for freelancers. This Oregon city has a decent 7.5 percent self-employed workers. That, along with a below average health insurance cost, is enough to offset the tax rate and cost of living expenses in . The third Texas city to make the list, boasts a low unemployment rate of 4.2 percent. That rate, plus a decent self-employment percentage and no income tax make it a great city for freelancers. An 8.7 percent self-employment percentage makes one of the most popular locations for freelancers in the country. However, Oaklands high income tax rate and cost of living knock it a few notches down on the list. Low housing and health insurance costs make a friendly city for freelancers. In addition, it has only a 4.5 percent income tax rate and self-employed people make up 5.7 percent of the workforce. has the same income tax and health insurance rates as Tucson.

Low insurance costs top the list of reasons for making a great home for freelancers. In addition, Albuquerque has reasonable taxes and housing costs compared to other major cities.

The first truly northern city on the list, has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, along with reasonable health insurance prices. offers extremely low housing costs, along with reasonable taxes and insurance prices. doesnt exactly offer the best rates for housing, taxes and insurance.

But in other parts of the world, it can make a pretty big difference. In Nigeria, about 80percentof the population uses bar soap to hand-wash their dishes each day. But liquid soap offers both economic and hygienic advantages. Thats where Nigerian entrepreneur Cynthia Ndubuisi got the idea for her business, . The company created a biodegradable dish soapthat is non-toxic and derived from plants. Ndubuisi needed some help with the technical aspects of her business. So she turned to mentoring website for assistance. Through the site, she met former UPS executive Gary Mastro. With his help, Ndubuisi was able to launch EverGlow, hire a team, and exceed growth expectations. But the two werent done yet. Ndubuisi wanted to help her local economy even more. And since farming is such a huge industry there, thats where she felt like she could make a real impact. One of Nigerias main crops is the cassava plant. Its used to make fufu, which is a very common Nigerian food, as well as other products like baking flour. But processing the cassava plant is very time-consuming. So it can be difficult for farmers to turn a profit by growing it. Ndubuisi came up with another method, which she to MicroMentor: The result was the Kadosh Production Company helping farmers increase their profits and decrease the waste involved in cassava farming. Ndubuisi also came up with a green solution for disposing of the cassava peels, making them into feed for livestock. That, in addition to the potential economic impact on the agriculture industry, make this new product an exciting opportunity for both Ndubuisi and Mastro. He explained to MicroMentor:","Every few months I come across something for marketers that I had absolutely no idea existed. This time, its the Google Grants program, an AdWords program for nonprofit organizations that falls into this category. Whether you own a nonprofit or not, its interesting to see what Google has to offer and what others in your industry might be using in order to advertise. Knowing how it all works could also help you make your decision one way or the other if starting a nonprofit was ever something you considered. Understanding this program is just another way to create well-rounded knowledge about Google. The idea is that nonprofits can advertise with Google at no cost. If your organization qualifies for the program, you get $10,000 per month in AdWords to advertise on Google to help accomplish your goals. Sounds great, right? It is an excellent program, but qualifying is strict and takes some time. As expected there is an application process, but you also need to make sure youre following all of the program details to a tee or you could lose the grant money. In most cases if youre a nonprofit organization youre going to be eligible without having to do any extra work. But it helps to know all of the qualifications before you spend time getting started. Knowing the eligibility requirements, shown below, is also a good place to start if youre still in the planning stages: While you have to possess the above to get involved, there are also strict organizations who cannot get involved, which might help you determine where your organization fits into the equation. If youre working with a hospital, medical group, government organization, school and/or academic program, or childcare centers, you are NOT eligible for the grant. Once youve got the grant, step #2 is, of course, keeping it. There are quite a few things you need to do to make sure you dont lose the grant you worked so hard to get: I recommend checking out this WordStream that includes some extra restrictions and tips. The also has more details and eligibility information for those wanting to learn. Have you used the Google Grants program in the past?","Professional documents can be time consuming to prepare, not to mention expensive if you have to hire a lawyer to draft them. If youve incorporated your small business or are planning to do so, from time to time youll need to prepare corporate documents to adopt or amend bylaws, appoint directors, select an accounting period, appoint officers to your board, and more. Many official corporate actions require proper documentation. If you dont observe formalities, you can lose the liability protections of the corporate structure. One solution is to start with corporate document templates you can use for a do-it-yourself approach. CorpNet has launched its , a free resource with dozens of templates, with just this purpose in mind. You choose specific corporate documents you need to generate. You fill in the blanks online. Then you print the completed document. And you meet your obligations to follow corporate requirements. This latest resource is one more example of continuous innovation by a service company. For instance, in May, CorpNet resource. A cloud-based corporate compliance tool, it lets business owners set up alerts keeping track of important tax and corporate filing deadlines. After a period of time out of the marketplace under a noncompete, they reentered the industry with their new company. Since then, the husband-and-wife business owner team has continued to adapt and innovate. The company recently tripled its office space to accommodate a growing staff and has spent an estimated quarter of a million dollars on product development, Akalp says. She estimates the company has incorporated more than 6,000 small businesses (or helped them file LLCs) in the last year. Akalp suggests that even small businesses in service industries can innovate  and must if they want to stay ahead of competitors. You have to constantly innovate and come out with new tools and apps that make the end users job easier, she says. We came out as the new kids on the block in 2009, and because of our constant product development to date, we are back in the game and right up there with the rest of the leaders. Akalp says CorpNet uses SurveyMonkey for client surveys and to get feedback about the companys website. Both have provided valuable feedback on the companys products and services, she adds. She suggests small business owners regularly engage with clients, finding out what they need through customer inquiries, surveys, and Google searches. Then find ways to respond to those needs with an evolving offering of products and services. Just dont stand still.","UK-based , a company that offers management of social media mentions, recently raised $1 million in funding. The company currently has only 20+ employees, but the money will be used to take its service global and to expand its features. Co-founder and CEO Vit Horky explains in a recent post on the official Brand Embassy blog: Besides monitoring your companys social media mentions, Brand Embassy places a big emphasis on customer service. Managers can assign social media mentions to company employees (known as ambassadors) so they can respond. If the mention is a complaint and likely to gain traction online, it is given high priority. In the past few years, customers have increasingly abandoned toll-free telephone numbers, and instead taken to social media to praise a brand or complain. So businesses must focus more on monitoring social media everyday. It can become quite a chore to keep on top of all the social channels separately. So having a dashboard where it all comes together is a huge plus. Vit says his companys clients have handled over 7.5 million service issues via its service since 2012. Currently Brand Embassy primarily serves companies in the telecom and financial services sectors. The companys clients may include mainly larger brands at the moment like Vodafone, Telefonica O2, T-Mobile, General Motors and ING.com. But with professional packages starting at $70 per month, its conceivable Brand Embassy could become an option for small boutique social media marketing firms with multiple brands to manage. If you are curious about how Brand Embassy works, the company has released an 8 minute video, showing the main features: As brand management on social media becomes ever more important, Brand Embassy would appear to offer a higher end service than tools like HootSuite, for example. Other services, like Socialbakers, offer variations on . Socialbakers also recently announced it had raised additional funding to expand its services.","Coca-Cola is one of the most recognized brands in the world. Originating in 1886, Coca-Cola has since gone beyond defining American culture and is produced and bottled locally in almost every country. How did the company become so popular? Its true they produce a drink that people enjoy and have bought several other drink companies to expand their variety. But Coca-Cola has always been a king in the marketing world. What sets them apart from other companies is the memorable ad campaigns they create that seem to stick around for generations. From cute commercials with baby polar bears to ads that feature popular athletes like Mean Joe Greene, has always known how to effectively use television as a marketing tool. A recent Coca-Cola marketing gimmick that has elicited plenty of smiles is a viral video of a special vending machine. Coca-Colas Happiness Machine has made an appearance in many countries and is receiving incredible online recognition. The ad is sure to invoke laughter; or, at the very least, a smile. After all, the best memories are made of smiles and laughter: Most consumers will remember humorous ads: think Super Bowl commercials. How many people watch the Super Bowl just for the commercials? The answer:Plenty. Its great entertainment. Good commercials make us laugh, and smart marketers know laughter is memorable, making consumers more likely to remember a product and buy it. No company has been more successful at this approach than Coca-Cola. The creative genius used in their successful Coca-Cola marketing campaigns goes back as far as 1886 and they have been creating clever ads ever since. Coca-Cola learned early how to make itsproduct memorable. Using beautiful women to help sell a product is not a new marketing technique. Coca-Cola was founded in 1886 by a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia, named John Pemberton. He sold his new concoction at a nearby pharmacy, Jacobs Pharmacy,for just 5 cents a glass. At that time, a on a poster encouraged consumers to Drink Coca-Cola. The beautiful girls in Coca-Cola marketing campaigns became so popular they were eventually featured in the book, Coca-Cola Girls: An Advertising Art History by Chris H. Beyer. At the beginning of the twentieth century, consumers wanted ways to make lives easier and their families happier and healthier. In 1905, a Coca-Cola ad proclaimed, Coca-Cola Revives and Refreshes, and in 1924, an ad that encouraged customers to not only Refresh Yourself, but bring an easily carried six-pack home, was also a success. It brought coke to consumers homes and marketing fame to Coca-Cola. By the mid-1920s, convincing customers everyone knew how good Coca-Cola really is was easy with campaigns that proclaimed six million bottles were sold each day. Each marketing slogan Coca-Cola produced seemed to be a hit with consumersand Coke was becoming a household name through its many famous marketing slogans. In 1931, even Santa Claus was known to enjoy a coke from time to time. In one ad, Santa Claus removes his stocking cap and announces, My hats off to the pause that refreshes. To this day, Santa Claus and Coca-Cola continue to be popular around Christmas time, his busiest time of year. Its no wonder after delivering all those toys Santa Claus wants to relax and enjoy a refreshing drink like Coke. Another early and successful Coca-Cola marketing marketing campaign was one that led consumers to believe Coca-Cola was for people just like them. Coca-Cola wanted to be Friends for Life, according to one slogan. The idea behind the ad was the hope that consumers would want to be associated with a company who considered them a friend. Once again, the strategy worked. The Coca-Cola company in 1948 expanded on that ideawhen the company came up with a new slogan: Where Theres Coke Theres Hospitality. Throughout the years, the company strived to evoke the image of friendship and fellowship through its many marketing campaigns, and they largely succeeded. Frequently, companies have chosen to use animals to help sell their product and the results have often been successful. Budweiser, a company that touts themselves as the King of Beer, uses horses as their animal of choice. The Budweiser Clydesdales and the spotted Dalmatian who proudly rides in the wagon behind them are singularly recognizable to television viewers. These commercials are some of the most memorable on television and the Internet, especially during the Super Bowl. Some Budweiser commercials make us smile and some can make us shed a tear, but that is what makes them memorable. With Coca-Cola, the animal of choice was the polar bear. Ads featuring polar bears were earmarked for worldwide audiences and it worked. Polar bears and Coke enjoyed immense popularity due to this genius campaign. Along with Santa Claus, polar bears are popular around the holiday season and reappear nearly every year in new commercials during the holidays. In 1971, Coca-Cola launched the famous ad slogan, Id Like to Buy the World a Coke. This campaign featured people from a variety of cultures around the world singing in unity. The commercial and overall campaign were so successful, several requests were made to record the jingle as a hit single: When the song was finally produced, the company donated all proceeds from the recording to UNICEF, which only added to the companys positive profile. With the early success of using beautiful women, fictional characters, and animals in their ad campaigns, Coca-Cola began to use famous spokespeople in their ads. Coca-Cola first used a popular musician, Hilda Clark, in 1904. Since then, Coca-Cola has used many their product, including sports stars, musicians, actors, and actresses. If youre looking for a simple way to advertise, how about with a vending machine like Coca-Colas most recent clever advertising with thefictitious happiness vending machine? In thevideo, the company took a common, everyday machine and used it to make millions of people happy. The ad has been so popular in the U.S. that there is now a similar version going viral in . When watching the ad online, its hard not to have a smile on your face. It is this marketing genius that makes consumers remember your product. The best commercials and slogans make us happy  and they are utterly unforgettable. Coca-Cola does appear to be the king of soft drinks and successful marketing, but there are worth mentioning, too. Dove is a company that sells beauty products for women. One of their most recent and successful ads, Doves Real Beauty, features real-life women. Unlike traditional beauty product ads that feature flawless, thin, beautiful models, the women in these groundbreaking ads have bodies in all shapes and sizes. When real women are featured in beauty ads, real women believe they are beautiful too and are more likely to identify with the advertising campaign. A cute little mandarin orange, known as the clementine, is no different from any other orange in taste and texture. The difference is how the company advertises the orange. Cuties, the name under which they are sold, are specifically marketed to children with its campaign that Kids love Cuties because Cuties are made for kids. While parents are paying the grocery bill, kids are choosing items at the store that appeal to them. The ad appears to be successful, because despite the fact Cuties are more expensive than other oranges, sales are skyrocketing. Companies will always find interesting ways to market their product, but they could learn a lesson or two from Coca-Cola: successful ads make a person smile and are memorable. Advertisers have to think about exactly who they want to reach and must find a way to relate to them. One way to do this is through humor. Make them laugh. Create a jingle they cant get out of their heads. Make them feel like a special friend. These are tactics Coca-Cola used to successfully market their soft drinks. For over 120 years, Coke has managed to be a recognizable product worldwide due to strategic and clever marketing. The only two countries where Coke is not officially bought or sold, , may soon find themselves enjoying a Coke and a smile. Eventually the drinks popularity may find a way in. Every companys product is unique, but they have to find a way to market that uniqueness. Brainstorm with your team of advertising professionals, find an animal that no other company has used before, feature children, or do something anthropomorphic. Above all, make it unforgettable! Follow the Coca-Cola marketing lead and find clever advertising methods or promotions that make your business stick out in customers minds. Embrace the spirit of fun. When fun is embraced, smiles and laughter are sure to follow.","If youve seen something that looks like this on Twitter  #awordorphrase  and arent sure what its all about, its a hashtag, and its meant to organize the stream of billions of Tweets into categories. Lets say you see and you click the link. Youll find all the most recent tweets using this hashtag. These are likely people interested in small business. Hashtags can be anything. and (Follow Friday) are examples of widely used hashtags, but there are plenty of lesser-known ones that Twitter junkies or businesses create themselves. Here youve got 10 ways you can start using hashtags to your benefit: Theres no rule saying you cant create your own hashtag for a promotion or event. Lets say you sell recycled paper products. You could create #HowIRecycle to encourage your followers to share their own recycling tips. The more people use it, the more others will latch onto it. Holding a contest online?You can tie a hashtag to it. Simply require entrants to send a tweet with the hashtag to enter. For example: Those that are using a hashtag youre interested in may be good people for you to follow. Find hashtags that relate to your industry or your target audiences interests. For example, if you sell dog supplies, find dog lovers to follow by searching . (also known as Twitter chats)are a great way to build a following around both your hashtag and your brand on Twitter. A Twitter chat is simply a designated time for people who share an interest to tweet about a topic. Sometimes youll have an expert or panel sharing tips, with others asking questions and chiming in. Choose a hashtag for the chat, or simply use the one youve already established. Choose a topic for your event (using the recycling example, you could host a Tweetchat about ways offices can recycle and reduce their carbon footprint) and publicize it. Dont forget to let participants know the time (accounting for time zones) of the event, as well as the hashtag they should follow to participate. Anyone who includes your hashtag will be included in the Twitter chat stream. You can learn a lot from other peoples Twitter chats, not only about the subject they cover, but also how to host a Twitter chat in general. Youll also meet other likeminded people to follow on Twitter. If you dont have time to read a dozen blogs, check the hashtags you follow to see whats happening in your industry. Youll often find links to news blurbs and blog posts, and can be selective about what you read. People are already talking about topics youre interested in. By following the corresponding hashtags, you can jump in with your own expertise. If youre already a lot, adding hashtags to the words you talk about frequently can help others who follow these hashtags find you. For instance, if you tweet about small business often, simply replace the words with #SMB in your tweets and all the small biz folks who follow that hashtag will now see your tweets. If you use Hootsuite or similar tool to organize and filter the tweets you view, having columns set up for certain hashtags can help you easily access the tweets you want. Hashtags are great, but dont go overboard! People have started making up their own hashtags, but Twitter may consider these spam, so its not a practice Id recomend. Use them when appropriate, and keep them simple and short if youre making them up.","Amazon recently announced acquiring , a Holland-based company, from Samsung.

The technique has applications not only for e-readers but for other devices like smartphones and laptops. Its true that Amazon already has a color Kindle, but it is really a tablet computer rather than an e-reader ( ). But this new technology would offer certain advantages over the black and white versions of the e-reader without certain disadvantages of the current color Kindle. : NateHoffelder at Digital Reader and suggested the color e-reader connection. The development, if it comes to pass, could be important to both readers of e-books and e-book publishers. When you consider that , it seems like the e-reader market needs some shaking up. A color screen would give people who already own a black-and-white Kindle reader a reason to upgrade, and get them excited to buy more Kindle books. And it could make Kindle content itself more compelling to owners of e-readers, especially for books with images in them. Who wouldnt rather see images in color?

And too many small businesses spend more money on AdWords than they need to, while not always getting good results. A small business spends on average $1,200 per month in Google AdWords, Kim says. And when youre as busy as most staff are in a small business, its hard to figure out and use all the best practices for AdWords, he adds. For instance, only 1% of small business advertisers log into their AdWords account at least once a week. As a result, small businesses using Google AdWords to advertise can waste a lot of money without knowing any better, and without knowing what to do to change the status quo. It doesnt need to be that way, though, Kim says  if people just had the right tools and information. For instance, benchmarking information is important.  Have you ever wondered how your business does, compared with other small businesses your size and in your industry, when it comes to Google AdWords? Are you spending more or less money? Are you getting more sales conversions, or less? For most of us who know just a little bit about Google AdWords, and dont have the time to sift through hours of information, we may never improve. Its too time consuming  and too baffling. And thats where comes in. A version of the AdWords benchmark tool has been offered for a couple of years now.  Today, WordStream launched an enhanced version of the Grader tool, to give small businesses access to even more business data and guidance. The enhancements focus on intelligence around mobile ad spending, which is growing at a fast pace, including assessing your mobile PPC readiness, as shown below: There are also improved AdWords benchmarking statistics and performance indicators. The tool actually grades your performance. A grade is expressed in a percentage (see image at top of article) so you can tell how youre doing. And now youll have access to even more data to compare how youre doing in specific areas. And perhaps best of all, the enhanced tool features a performance tracker (image below) that compares how your AdWords account is doing over time, and can send you a monthly report showing progress or lack thereof. That way, you can monitor and manage your AdWords activity intelligently. Kim, like many a bootstrapped startup founder, started WordStream in his basement several years ago. He has built it up to the multimillion dollar business it is today, and says his company has now sifted through $3 billion in AdWords spending data. WordStream has been able to take that data and distill it down into insights and best practices advice for small businesses. Think of the AdWords Grader tool as big data meets Google AdWords, for small businesses. Robert Brady, a pay-per-click guru and founder of , echoes Kims sentiments about wasted advertising budgets and emphasizes the need for information and hands-on involvement. We reached out to Brady for his reaction to todays news. (Brady is one of our top contributors here at Small Business Trends.) He told us in an interview, GoogleAdWords has become more and more complex over the years, making it harder for SMBs. Many default settings in AdWords seem to benefit Googles bottom line more than advertiser performance. He advocates using tools so that they give you an advantage and help you perform better while spending less. The key is that you have to regularly tend yourAdWords advertising, if you want to be effective and spend money wisely. Use whatever system works for you (software, sticky notes, apps) but attention and activity are necessary for success, Brady emphasizes. .","Yelp is one of the top ways for local businesses to get noticed and found by consumers, especially on mobile devices. It is an easy and affordable way to market your company and it is not just for restaurants. If you run a company that uses or could leverage its local presence, Yelp is worth testing out. Brick and mortar businesses often are the most logical companies using Yelp. My business does not have a local presence in the way that matters to mobile consumers (or any consumers since I serve business owners directly), so I tested Yelp with my TechBizTalk brand knowing it would not be found. As you can see in the screenshot above, my business was not found. Right below that, you see a blue link Add Your Business to Yelp and thats where you should start. Go directly to the . Yelp knows they have to make it super easy and super fast to attract a business owner who is wearing many hats. The business page immediately lets you know the value proposition. On that page, youll see: Then a button to Create a free account now. After you locate your business, youll hit that simple and fast process I alluded to, as you can see in this screenshot, there isnt much to do and you can be up and running in minutes. Unlike some other review services, that add lots of layers and steps, Yelp wants you to verify and get active in the community. Thats it. You hit the Add button and your listing is live. Yelp will review your listing to make sure youre not a spammer or someone who doesnt really own or manage the company. So, if youre serious about putting up a new listing, fill in all the blanks including your Web address and phone number because the listing goes up right away. You cannot change it until they finish the verification process. It isnt instant, thats all I can say at this point. So you dont want to play around with incomplete information. Having an account gives you a lot more control and opportunity to engage.Once you have your listing complete, you can add special offers, upload photos, and interact with your customers. You also get access to the statistics on who visits your Yelp profile, which can be huge to creating smarter offers and coupons. Creating offers, via Yelp advertising, has mostly pros in my view, but some people have complained that Yelp blackmails small business owners into paying for advertising. if you have a free listing on the service, competitor ads may show up on the same page next to or below your profile. Before you freak out, many, many services do exactly this and no one blinks an eye. Look at Google, Facebook, and now Twitter, just to name a few. Your organic listing in Google very likely shows competitive pay-per-click ads at the top of the page. The positive with Yelp is if you are an advertiser, they give you the option (and who wouldnt take it) to block competitor ads when your profile comes up. You dont get that option with the others I mentioned. Far from it. So, I see it as a huge opportunity, not blackmail. Business is competitive. Yelp is not doing anything wrong. They are helping the retailer and other service-oriented business. If you have been around as a retailer or local business for a while, then it is very probable you are already on Yelp and have reviews. All the more reason to claim and verify your listing. As Lisa Barone points out in several posts, Yelp can be a small business owners best friend,   and  . You can also learn more . How are you using Yelp?","Were all hearing a lot of talk right now about . Weve already told you why you shouldnt fear it and even offered up some to help get you started. However, you still may be asking yourself, whats the ? What does content marketing mean and why is it so important to your business? The goal of content marketing is to create informative content that is designed to, over time, convert customers and to keep previous customers loyal to your brand. Its an attention marketing strategy where you use content to attract people to your brand and then keep them there. As you can imagine, there can be a pretty big time investment associated with content marketing. Soas a small business owner, why should you be doing it? Whats the payoff? Below are five reasons content marketing matters to your business. The biggest benefit content marketing has to offer to a small business is awareness. After all, a customer cant make a purchase from your brand if they dont know about you. And content is a great way to make that initial introduction. Whether its a blog you consistently update, an eBook you distribute, a webinar series you participate in, a newsletter you write, a tool you create, etc, by regularly creating content stuffs it gives you something to promote, to be found for, and to use as an awareness tool when courting a prospective or repeat customer. Each piece of content you write and publish is a trail you leave for the search engines and your users to find and associate you with. When you create something of great value and then give it away to your customers simply because they deserve it you create trust. You help them to trust that you have their best interest in mind, you help them trust that youre a valuable resource, and you help them to trust that your business is one that honors its customers. And thats what content marketing is based on. Its hand delivering content to your customers today for free in an effort to build a relationship you can cash in on later. You trust theyll be around when you need them, and they trust the same thing right back. Of course, building awareness and trust are only your first obstacles in business. Once that initial hello has been uttered, you need to start the lead generation process to convert those eyes. That means using content marketing to do more than just build awareness about your company  but to provide authoritative and resourceful information about it. This is where you use content to share information about your products, your services, the industry that youre a part of, your unique company story, what youre passionate about, etc. This stage of the content marketing stage is all about setting your company up as an authority and showing customers, through your content, that youre capable of handling their needs. Its where you begin telling your story to pique that interest, while also demonstrating your unique abilities as a service provider. Content marketing aids in the upsell process by helping customers to see the relationship between certain products and services. Lets face it  many of us arent good at upselling customers. We know that even if its sometimes in a customers best interest to purchase services or goods in bundles, were not always the best at presenting it to them. Or at least not verbally. However, content marketing makes this a little easier. You can use the content on your Web site to show the relationships between two different products and how theyre used together, and how they help make a process easier. You can paint the picture for your customers and help them see a new reality. Dont make your content another commercial for your products, but do highlight how seamlessly two products go together for better results. Or show data that lets your customers see that people who purchase X and Y together actually see a greater ROI. Content marketing allows you to tell a more compelling story. If youre doing content marketing right, you can be sure that LOTS of people are stumbling across it. Your current customers are reading it, past customers, competitors, people who find you via keyword searches, your vendors or partners, etc. But do you know who is reading what youre putting out? Its arguably one of the most important groups of all. customers. Were talking about those people in the in between stage. They have a problem/need and theyre still researching what company they want to seek out to help them fix it. Theyre doing their research  reading your blog, checking you out on social media, reading articles youve written, etc. They want to know what your process looks like, what types of services you offer, and if you have experience with their exact need. Smart content marketers will understand these prospective customer types and then craft content around their needs, giving them something to find during the homework process that goes into selecting a vendor. Its strategic content marketing at its best. Those are just a few ways that a content marketing investment may make sense for your business. How are you using content marketing for your business or how would you LIKE to be using it?","Ryan Welsh/Flickr Wells Fargo is set to release their second quarter earnings at 8:00 a.m. ET Friday. Analysts are expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 on revenue of $22.21 billion, according to Bloomberg. In the same quarter last year , Wells beat expectations, reporting earnings per share of $1.04 ($1.03 expected) on revenue of $24.3 billion. In the first quarter , Wells beat on the top and bottom lines, reporting earnings of $0.99 per share ($0.97 expected) on revenue of $22.2 billion, beating estimates of $21.61 billion. "" Wells Fargo's first quarter results reflected the benefit of our diversified business model as we managed challenges presented by a volatile operating environment for our industry ,"" CEO John Stumpf said after the earnings. The big story during the second quarter was the UK's decision in June to leave the European Union, which sent shockwaves through markets. Brexit is less of a big deal for Wells than it is for other major US banks, as Wells has less exposure to the UK. However, Wells has a larger portfolio of home mortgages, and tumbling bond rates due to the Brexit have lead to near all-time lows in mortgage rates which could suppress the bank's net interest margins. JPMorgan reported Q2 earnings on Thursday, beating expectations. Citi is also expected to report Friday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch will report Monday, Goldman Sachs Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley Wednesday.

They may soon turn to the site to generate sales as well.A new feature from Yelp, Yelp Platform, will allow small business owners to make sales directly from the customer review site. The company announced roll out of its Yelp Platform recently. In a post on the official Yelp Web Log, Founder : Yelp users were once limited to posting reviews, photos, and other information about a restaurant or some other type of service-based business. Now theyll be able to take that a step further and actually place orders. Yelp is currently working with select restaurants across the country beginning with food delivery and pickup services. Check out pages for two restaurants already using the new Yelp delivery and pickup pages: in New York City and in San Francisco. The company is also working with and on the roll out of the new ordering and delivery features. To use Yelps new pages simply select Enter your deliver address and then do so. Or select Pickup if you plan to visit the restaurant yourself to fetch your food. Then hit Start Order and use the simple order page to make your selection The new Yelp feature offers the perfect combination of word of mouth and e-commerce. Browse reviews of each business by fellow customers then order from the business of your choice all on the same page. Eventually Stoppelman says customers will be able to order delivery from thousands of restaurants in the U.S. The company next plans to introduce other categories of business like dentist offices, yoga studios, spas and salons, he added.","Curved is all the rage when it comes to smartphones these days. In fact,2014 may be shaping up as the year of curved smartphones. First at an eye-popping price of about $1,000. Then Apple announced it would be releasing sometime in 2014. And now in November, says its phone (pictured) will soon be arriving on U.S. shores. The G Flex will be available inthe United States in the first quarter 2014, through AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile. So why does a phone need to be curved, and what are the advantages of curved smartphones over flat / straight smartphones? According to the LG press release, there are : Heres a review of the device from TechSmartt: The phone also features a 13 megapixel camera on the back and a two megapixel camera on the front. Reviewers say the battery (which is also curved, of course) will stand up to days of heavy use. The phones curved design supposedly allows it to be more resilient. If weight is applied flattening the phone (say by someone sitting on it or sitting down with it in his or her back pocket), no worries, reviewers say.The phone will simply bend back to its proper shape undamaged. Theres also the much discussed self-healing back of the device on which minor scuff marks from your keys, for example, when the phone is in your pocket, seem to disappear over time. (Just dont take a knife to it or anything more extreme.) So, with all these pros, what kind of negatives could possibly discourage you from buying this phone for your business? Well, the cost might be one thing. Android Authority that, based on the phones current price in its native Korea, it might cost more than $900 here in the states. That might be more than $200 out of pocket even after signing a two year contract and receiving carrier subsidies.","Heres a bit of bad news for entrepreneurs seeking to finance high potential startups. Venture capitalists are doing fewer deals and investing less money than they did before the financial crisis and the Great Recession. According to data from Price Waterhouse Coopers and the National Venture Capital Association, the number of venture capital deals shrank from 4,211 in 2007 to 3,698 in 2012. The amount that venture capitalists put into companies is also down substantially. Measured in inflation-adjusted terms, in 2012 venture capitalists only invested 75 percent of the amount they did in 2007. Deals are also smaller than they were before the Great Recession. In real dollar terms, the average deal size declined from $8.4 million in 2007 to $7.2 million in 2012. For entrepreneurs looking for a first time investment, the numbers are also discouraging. In 2012, VCs made 1,163 first sequence deals, down from 1,418 in 2007, a decline of 18 percent. The amount invested dropped even more. In inflation-adjusted terms, VCs put a whopping 52 percent less into first time deals in 2012 than in 2007. The average deal also has been shrinking since the Great Recession, as the figure above shows. In inflation-adjusted terms, the average 2012 first investment was only 59 percent the size of the average 2007 initial investment. The shrinkage in first sequence deals has occurred across all investment stages, with the decline in the inflation-adjusted amount invested heaviest in the seed and expansion stages. For number of deals, the decline was present for all stages, except for the early stage. First sequence deals have become more focused at the early stage. In 2012, early stage deals accounting for 51 percent of all first sequence venture capital funding, up from 38 percent in 2007. The number of early stage deals increased from 42 to 65 percent of the total. However, the shift in the investment stage wasnt towards younger companies. Both in terms of the amount invested and the number of deals, the growth in early stage financing came at the expense of declines in both seed stage deals and expansion stage deals (the stages before and after the early stage.)","Sometimes it just makes sense to hire remote workers, since they can bring invaluable knowledge about diverse demographics to the table. Remote workers have increased flexibility. They can be hired at the pay rates common in their home country, and they can bring localized expertise to the table. Virtual assistants, foreign staff members, telecommuting workers, and freelancers are some of the most common virtual office relationships small businesses are cultivating. Below are ways to boost productivity, streamline workflows and protect your companys data while employing remote workers. Dont get too comfortable with your marketing and sales tactics just yet. Just because one strategy is successful in your home location, it doesnt mean that you should use the same strategy in a remote location. Project managers, leadership, and marketing teams must collaborate with remote workers to identify an areas needs and develop multilingual content. (The European Lung Foundations website is an excellent example of localization efforts. This non-profit is able to disseminate useful health information in different languages, increasing their impact dramatically.) Youll need to vet your remote workers carefully. Language fluency and cultural awareness are some of the most obvious boons that local hires can provide for a company. Avoid using cookie-cutter strategies when it comes to branding, marketing and customer relations  cultural awareness in remote offices can lead to healthier operations. Remote and telecommuting workers present unique risks and challenges for data security. Since these individuals are working from home, cafes or community office spaces, it can be difficult to control their access and data traffic. If a virtual workers mobile device or computer is lost or stolen, then your companys sensitive information could be compromised. IT departments can combat some of these risks by using secure software as a solution (SaaS). Remote workers who have access to CRMs (content management systems), databases should be required to sign in with strong passwords, which need to be changed every few months. Your SaaS sessions should time out after a specific period of time, so that unauthorized people cannot view sensitive data. Streamlining your software can make collaboration and data security easier to manage. When you ask customer or remote worker to contact your company, you can use a single 1-800-number to manage all of your phone calls. This front-facing phone number can forward all calls to your call operator, provided youre using the number . A streamlined phone system can cut your communications costs immensely. Remote workers can get in touch with your main office easily, using a single number. Additionally, a toll-free-number can simplify customer relations, since they have a single point of contact to reach your representatives. Another popular method of remote worker communication is video conferencing. This technology is breaking down distance barriers between remote office locations. Just take a look at , a startup app company that has designed a video portal for employees separated across great distances. Freelancers on the road can mount an iPad onto a wall of their home office. The camera recognizes when someone is making eye contact with the screen, and will automatically switch a microphone on. Two workers can turn to an iPad screen and converse naturally with video conferencing. It is important to revisit software, localization, and communication concerns as your company hires remote workers around the world. Part of the thrill of expansion is that your company can get familiar with new demographics and offer products to international audiences. Localization efforts and streamlined communications, such as affordable 1-800-numbers, ensure that you are connecting with prospective customers on a global stage.","We hear this all the time  perception is reality.

Coincidentally, Anita Campbell was part of a great webinar yesterday afternoon put on by the that focused on how to use coupons and social media to build customer loyalty. I decided to take some of my own advice and sit in on it. And Im really glad that I did.  During the webinar Anita shared a lot of valuable information that I thought readers of SmallBizTrends may find useful and that may be worth sharing here. Heres a bit of what was discussed yesterday in case you missed it. Forty percent of the vendors polled during the webinar said they offered coupons and discounts to their audience. While that number may have been curved a bit due to a slightly savvier audience , its still pretty impressive. Also impressive is that according to coupons.com, the growth of digital or online coupons is outpacing printed newspaper coupons 10 to 1, with coupons/rewards serving as the fifth largest growing Internet category in 2009 (up 36 percent YOY). That tells me one thing  coupons are a hot way for SMB owners to retain customers. While mobile coupons wont come up and remove print coupons overnight, you can expect to see an increased shift towards mobile year after year, so you should be following suit. Another thing discussed was WHY mobile coupons are gaining steam, even if its as people would like.  Their success comes from the fact that email and text coupons are opt-in, which helps make them more relevant to peoples interest. By opting in your customers have already told you that, yes, they want to receive that message from you. It provides a high correlation between that coupon and a customer actually doing something with it.  While mobile coupons are gaining market share, theyre still being used most by the young, affluent and female. Obviously, the questions of where and how are vital when talking about using coupons to encourage customer loyalty. Once you create a coupon program, where should you distribute them? Anita highlighted several options: And when it comes to the how for spreading awareness, the answer seems simple: social media. During the webinar, Anita highlighted several key social media sites that SMB owners should use to get word about coupons and promotions. :  Twitter continues to grow as a vehicle for SMB owners to spread what theyre doing. There are two ways to use Twitter to promote coupons: Anita mentioned some other Twitter tips like putting your Twitter handle on documents, door signs, email; making sure your offers are short enough to be retweeted; and to use words like coupon or discount so that those looking for deals via Twitter Search can find you. :  Anita also advised that SMB owners set up a Facebook fan page to give customers another place to engage. Use your page to hold Facebook-only specials, alert customers to events youre involved in, highlight promotions youre running, etc. You can also purchase advertisements on Facebook to help you promote your page and expand your reach. If you can include lots of photos and videos on your page this is a good way to draw people in. I recently wrote about that may be worth a read. : Many business owners may not know that  Yelp allows SMBs to include a short announcement message on their page. This is a great place to mention any current coupons or promotions youre offering. On a side note, if you havent read the , you should. Theres a lot of important info to be had. :  Sites like FourSquare, Gowalla and Booyah allow consumers to see what others like them have said about a business while theyre visiting. You can partner with vendors you work with to leverage networks. Another great tactic is to team up with other blogs and bloggers to help get your message in front of audiences.  Anita encouraged targeting blogs that you know your audience is reading. Doing so helps you to ensure that theyve seen your promotion and that it stays top of mind. I thought yesterdays webinar provided some great tips for SMB owners looking to increase customer loyalty through coupons. What are some methods youve employed in your own business?","Phil Simons newest book, , is the kind of book to read if you want to better understand the Internet and how your company can fit into it and create a business model to profit from it. The subtitle How Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google Have Redefined Business gives further clues of what this book is about. Simon refers to these four companies as the Gang of Four. Its a term first used by Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google, to describe four tech companies that are growing at unprecedented rates. The premise of the book is that these four companies have created not just companies, not just technology. Theyve createdplatforms  and platforms are something that YOU can leverage with a small business. Or you can create your own smaller platform. Whats a platform? Its a valuable and powerful technology ecosystem. It scales and grows quickly. It serves customers, yes. But it also serves vendors and partners, who use it for their own business purposes. A platform embraces third-party collaboration. The platform, he says, is becoming one of the most important business models of the new millennium and new companies are hitching their wagons on the platform. Platforms have benefits and they have their downsides. Benefits for you include a place to sell and distribute your content (Amazon or Apples iTunes) or promote your business (Google or Facebook). To understand the benefits of a platform, you have to understand consumer behavior. Simon says that consumers want one-stop shopping, even at the expense of missing out on the best app or service. They like platforms; they dont want to manage 100 different devices, sites, and services. Of course, the downsides include the fact that a platform may end up becoming your competitor. Or it may just go out of fashion (think MySpace), leaving you to have to re-establish a foothold on another platform. Therefore, you must be fluid and nimble, and able to change as circumstances change. The author ( on Twitter) is a and former tech consultant. We had Simon on my radio show to discuss this concept of platform ( if youd like to hear more in the authors own voice). I was intrigued and he offered to send me a review copy so I could share more with you. If you love to read about Google and Amazon  or are amazed at the growth of Facebook or how Apple can keep churning out new products that continue to delight  then you will love this book for that reason alone. These are history-making companies. We are seeing in real time how they change consumers lives. And, as the book points out, we are seeing how they are changing the Internet since roughly 2005. I know I can hardly resist reading a good article about these companies and how they are changing the Web. Im fascinated. But reading an article here and there gives you a fragmented view. Reading a book gives you a broader view of the landscape, and puts more in context. You capture more of the nuances. You get a better understanding when you read a book. Another thing to like about this book is the way it gets you thinking about how to use the platforms of the Gang of Four (and other smaller platforms) to benefit your own business. Its a book that raises more questions to think about, than perhaps it answers. Thats actually a good thing. After all, to build our businesses using the Internet we have to first open our minds and understand enough to know the possibilities. This is a book for anyone with a business that is using the Internet to generate revenues  or wants to. If you produce content and want to promote or sell it online, read this book. If you create apps and need to get those apps to the populace, read this book. If you have developed technology or a product and need to market it, read this book. If you are struggling with your online business model, or finding that your business model has to evolve due to circumstances outside your control, read this book. It is NOT a how-to book in the true sense of the term. You will not be presented with chapter after chapter of detailed steps to take to create your own platform or learn to use the platforms of other companies. Yes, there is a chapter of about 30 pages called The How: Tips for Building a Platform. But you will have to do the thinking and heavy lifting to build your platform and learn to leverage others. Still, not every book needs to be a how-to. Its an important book in the sense of understanding the big picture and how your business can fit in. We liked it so much that our Book Editors added it to our list of . If you want to learn more you can read the foreword and listen to the Introduction in audio, . I recommend you read to start sparking ideas for where to take your business in the future.","We are entering our 11th year running a blog that long since has evolved into a news site and content resource.

Starting today Monday March 30, small businesses in select markets nationwide will be able to offer services to customers through the eCommerce site up until now known mostly for selling products. A from TechCrunch notes that Amazon will re-launch its Amazon Local Services as Amazon Home Services. The new service will allow businesses like plumbers, house painters, vehicle mechanics, and other service-based operations to sell their skills on Amazon. The new can be viewed as direct competition to a site like Angies List, which also connects local service businesses with potential customers in need of their skills. TechCrunch notes that Home Services predecessor Amazon Home Services, launched back in 2014 was originally dedicated primarily to services related to products Amazon sold. For example, Amazon might sell a customer a flat screen TV and then in some markets also offer the services of a handy man who would mount that TV to your wall. But with the new service, the list of service providers is expected to expand. And companies offering services not related to Amazon products will be able to use Home Services as another platform to market their businesses and generate sales. But indications are that Amazon will not add just any business to its service offerings on Home Services. The company will do screenings on companies before they allow them to sell their services through the e-retail site. The of services purportedly will include things like auto repair, tech support help, interior decorating, and lawn care services offered. This is according to a list of services posted on an Amazon site believed to be tied to the new launch. Here are the cities where Amazon is rolling out Home Services first: Miami, San Francisco, New York, Houston, Seattle, Chicago, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Atlanta, Phoenix, San Diego, San Jose, Portland, Minneapolis, Detroit, Denver, Riverside, Tampa, Orlando, Austin, Sacramento, Pittsburgh, Nashville, Cincinnati, Charlotte, and St. Louis. And offering services through Amazon comes with another little hitch. Businesses signing up to become part of the Home Services program should be aware that the eCommerce giant will be taking its cut, as always. For every standard service provided via an online sale, Amazon will take 20 percent of the sale price. For customized services, Amazon takes 15 percent. Amazon takes a 10 percent cut on any recurring services purchases, according to the companys site.","HP eight new tablets Jan. 20, 2015.

If youre not using social media to its full potential, youre missing out on a world of promotional possibilities. Incorporate social media into your next trade show and youll find that it can boost trade show success in many ways. Giveaways are standard at , but you dont have to stick with boring swag. Include a few big-ticket items that will draw more interest to your booth. To snag these top prizes, visitors must interact with your social media sites. There are lots of creative options. Tweet that the first person to come to the booth and share your code word will get the prize. Allow prize entries for a brief period for each item. Post the schedule on Facebook. Encourage trade show visitors to follow your social media sites by letting them know that youll run a whole week of special promotions after the trade show. Each day offer a new deal such as 25% off certain services, free upgrades, BOGO offers, and more. This strategy will keep your potential customers involved long after your booths dismantled. If your trade show booth spacegets swamped with visitors, passers-by may not want to stop and wait for personal attention or push through the crowd to peruse your giveaway pens and notepads (after all, the next table has similar stuff.) Include a large QR code on your booth that makes it easy for visitors to snap and move on. Make sure the page you direct them to has easy links for following all your social media sites. In the days and weeks after the event, direct your posts to your new and hopefully curious followers who want to get to know who you are. Include lots of features that will help them find out what youre about. Set up an event page on Facebook thats focused on the event alone. This is a great way to get attendees excited and promote the many activities that will be going on. Interacting with customers before the show will give you a better idea of what they want to see. Dont waste time lugging all your multimedia equipment along if a survey shows that theyre most interested in one-on-one conversations with sales reps.Use the funds to take more people along with you instead. Trade show attendees want to hit a lot of stops in a limited amount of time. You can send them home with a pile of literature, but its likely to get lost in the cavernous swag bag. Instead, blog about common questions before and after the event and direct your leads to this resource as an informative way of getting to know you better. Integrate your social media marketing strategy and your trade show event for a seamless promotion that will . Never underestimate the power of a well-managed social site. Did you create a social media campaign for your recent trade show event that brought the attendees to your booth? Or have you seen some great uses of social media at recent conference or convention? Would love to read it.","As most people know, unless you participate in social networks, you wont get much out of them.The same is true with LinkedIn. One way to engage with others is by posting several Status Updates a day.But sometimes its hard to create strong Status Updates. The good news? A feature that LinkedIn began rolling out in April, 2013, is extremely helpful in creating powerful LinkedIn status updates. Still not widely used at this point, its the LinkedIn Mentions or option. It allows you to call out someone, similar to Twitter or Facebook. They get notified that youve mentioned them. This feature is only available, at this time, for personal LinkedIn status updates. As of this writing, it is not yet available for company page status updates or group discussions. 1. Go to the home page of LinkedIn. Make sure you are logged in. You will see your status updates there. When you want to mention a LinkedIn connection or company, begin by using the sign and then typing the name of a company or connection in the status update box. Example: @BizSugar. 2. A drop down box will appear with your connections. Select your desired LinkedIn connection or company from the list of connections that appear in the drop-down box (you must be a first-level LinkedIn connection to show up in the drop-down box; you dont need to follow a company to include a company name, however). Complete your status update and share it. 3. The mentioned connection or company will receive an instant notification informing them they have been mentioned on LinkedIn. See the image below indicating how simple it is to use LinkedIn @Mentions. Recommend a product or service, or both, and include the @mention of the person who created it or is selling it. Thank someone for sharing useful information. Instead of just sharing great content, include a comment that mentions a person or company. Congratulate a person or business for winning an award or accomplishing an achievement or special milestone of some sort. As Dale Carnegie said: The person or company you mention is immediately notified of the mention, so you get on their radar screen in a positive way. This encourages the mentioned person or company to reciprocate in some way, as people naturally feel compelled to return the favor. This could be by posting something nice about you, sending you a referral, giving you business, etc. By saying something nice about someone else, you look great to others. You are providing excellent word-of-mouth for the mentioned product, service, person or organization, which in turn helps them get more connections and business. Start creating more powerful LinkedIn Status updates by using the option today. Youll develop stronger connections and create more business opportunities.","Its the end of another week.

The big story in small business lending continues to be the activity of alternative lenders  credit unions, as well as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI), micro lenders, and others. They approved 62.2% of the funding requests , a rise from 62% in November. Within the alternative lender category, credit unions became increasingly active in small business lending in 2011. Credit unions granted 57.4% of small business funding requests up from 57% in November. December loan approvals by small banks increased to 47.1%, their highest rate of the year, up from 47% in November. Optimism is on the rise as the year begins. We have seen a 30% increase in the volume of new loan applications, which is a good sign. Big banks were the only category of lender that dipped at the end of 2011. Approvals by banks with assets between $10- $50 billion fell in December to 9.7%, thereby reversing a three-month upward trend. Large banks are coming back in the market, albeit cautiously. However, the big banks wanted to shore up their capital base at end of 2011 and thus reduced their outstanding loan portfolio in December. They are continuing to monitor the European financial crisis, as well as the debt battle in Congress. National and international issues impact big banks more than smaller lenders. 2011 Big Bank ($10B+ assets): Approval %, Small Bank Approval %, Credit Union Approval %, Alternative Lenders Approval %: January: 12.8% 43.5% 48.9% 49.3% February: 11.9% 43.9% 49.1%  51.6% March: 11.6% 44.2%  48.8%  51.9% April: 10.4%  44.6%  50.1%  53.6% May: 9.8% 45.0%  51.2% 53.8% June: 8.9% 42.5%  52.3%  54.9% July: 9.8% 44.9%  53.4%  52.2% August: 9.4% 43.8%  54.2%  58.0% September: 9.2% 45.1%  55.5%  61.5% October: 9.3% 46.3%  56.6%  61.8% November: 10.0% 47.0%  57.0%  62.0% December: 9.7%  47.1%  57.4%  62.2% * Banks with more than $10 billion in assets are classified as big banks. * Credit Unions are considered alternative lenders. * The alternative lenders category includes credit unions, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI), micro lenders, accounts receivable financers, and others. The top story in small business lending is the aggressiveness of alternative lenders and continued flip flops on part of big banks in their lending policies to small businesses. Further, we have noticed an increase in startups looking for funding. Startups have an easier time securing capital from smaller banks and alternative lenders. Bigger banks are more stringent and usually seek to fund only businesses that can produce documentation that they have been operating for more than two years. Obviously, a startup cannot do that. So entrepreneurs are going elsewhere for money. Based on what I am seeing, if you are a small business seeking funding from a bank, my advice is to think small  not big.","Big data is big news in todays digitized world. With the explosion of Internet usage and social media networks, theres a massive cloud of data being generated about people all over the world, and its growing at an exponential rate. Until recently, big data has been a mining center for big business to learn more about customer behaviors, desires, trends and browsing or buying patterns. It takes a sophisticated system and considerable computing power to sort through all that information and pull something useful out of it. However, technology has advanced in powerand come down in price. Now, even small businesses can tap into the power of big data to improve the customer experience and boost bottom lines. The term big data covers a lot of ground. Data is collected from every action thats performed on an Internet-connected networksending an email or tweet, posting to Facebook or a blog, commenting or rating, updating a profile, shopping online, using a cell phone or tablet, even swiping a credit card at a physical store. Every action generates a digital footprint thats stored somewhere in the ether. Thats a lot of data. To obtain useful information from this vast ocean, youll need some serious analytical power that can find the relevant bits and display them in a format you can understand. Fortunately, that power is both affordable and accessible through various platforms from free programs like Google Analytics to inexpensive business tools like customer relationship management (CRM) software. If youre looking to tap into the vast, rich landscape of big data, there are a number of avenues to explore. Youre already connected to many of your customers through your business social media networks,arent you? Well, the data collection doesnt have to stop there. Tools like , , and Kurrently let you set up alerts and notifications whenever a subject is mentioned online like your business itself, the products or services you offer or any relevant keyword. Once you start tracking these mentions, you can tailor your responses and conversations to build buzz, generate more interest and improve customer satisfaction and engagement. There are many inexpensive (even free) CRM systems that offer fully featured platforms to track interactions with customers and prospects. Programs such as , , and not only provide an inside line to big data, but also help you sort through it and pinpoint the most helpful information. These platforms also include social media functionality, so you can streamline your big data collection from multiple sources. Whether youre working with a few office lines, a VoIP system with mobile capabilities, or a third-party call center, customer service calls can be an important source of data. Be sure youre collecting your call logs and analyzing the information. Customer call data can help you: Many include analytics and automated call logs, and theyre also an inexpensive solution for business voice needs. How can your small business take advantage of big data?","Despite (PDF) by some small business advocates that intellectual property (IP) is the backbone of Americas innovative small businesses, small companies are less likely than large ones to believe that legal forms of intellectual property (IP) protection are important to their operations, a National Science Foundation (NSF) reveals. The 2011 Business R&D and Innovation Survey, a massive effort to tap the views of 45,000 public and private for profit enterprises about their innovative activity, queried businesses about the importance to them of six forms of IP protection: For companies that undertake research and development (R&D) activities, a higher fraction of businesses with five hundred or more employees than businesses with fewer than five hundred workers rated all six forms of IP protection as very important or somewhat important to them. As the figure aboveshows, for most of the forms of IP protection, the differences between big and small businesses are not trivial. While 57.5 percent of large R&D-performing companies reported that utility patents are important to them, only 32.6 percent of small R&D-performing companies said so. Similarly, 80.6 percent of large R&D-performing companies said that trademarks are important, while only 56.3 percent of small R&D-performing companies reported the value of that form of IP protection. For small companies, trade secrets were the most important form of intellectual property protection, identified by 64.1 percent of companies, followed by trademarks at 56.3 percent of companies, and copyrights at 47.3 percent. Both utility and design patents were less important than these other three forms of IP protection, coming in at 32.6 and 30.5 percent of small businesses, respectively. Mask works were important to the smallest fraction of small companies (7.9 percent), probably owing to their very specialized nature. Over time, intellectual property has become more useful to companies competing in high tech industries  the ones in which a high fraction of companies invest in R&D. This trend makes the pattern shown by the NSF data troubling. As IP becomes more important to the competitive strategies of businesses, its lesser importance to small companies makes one wonder if small business owners are missing out on an increasingly valuable source of competitive advantage.","Subscribe to the Bloomberg Odd Lots podcast (Pocket Casts)  Subscribe to the Bloomberg Odd Lots podcast (iTunes) Every week, hosts Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway take you on a not-so-random walk through hot topics in markets, finance, and economics.

As Twitter continues to tinker with potential new layouts and designs, the company has reportedly introduced Fave People to some users. Essentially, Fave People is a way of following your favorite Twitter users in a separate list. Of course, Twitters Lists feature already allows you to do this. But that feature isnt the most user-friendly. TechCrunchs Sarah Perez : TechCrunch reports the new Fave People feature can be reached in a side-scrolling menu at the top of Twitters mobile alpha app, which is used by its testers. Adding profiles to your Fave People list involves clicking a star icon. When you click the star associated with a profile, its added to your Fave People list. You can configure Fave People to send you notifications when Tweets are sent from the accounts youve selected, too. The future of Fave People will likely depend on how its received by testers. If testers find the new service engaging, Fave People could find its way to everyones profile after the testing period ends.This would become another way of customizing your Twitter account and perhaps cutting down on the noise. Twitter has been toying with other potential changes to its layout and user experience. For example, may be in the offing at Twitter. The company even tested out the new profile look on some users accounts recently. ,","This sponsored post is produced in association with Ytel. Consumers have thoroughly embraced the brave new world of modern communication and always-on connectivity  and theyve also come to expect that. And if youre a smart marketer, youre going to follow them into that increasingly well-settled frontier to keep your competitive edge with an omnichannel approach supported by cloud communications. But youre not alone. A study by Neustar found that 40 percent of companies believe that omnichannel marketing is important  and 30 percent believe these strategies are critical. 35 percent are already out there with their message broadcasting throughout a customers digital life, with 27 percent making plans to get there soon. The VentureBeat Insight report, Omnichannel Trends: Data, platforms, mobile, and commerce , found that 34 percent of marketers are upping their game by appealing to two to three channels, while 7 percent juggle an extraordinary 1020 platforms in their effort to corner of their targets attention. Its a hell of a crowd, and you need to earn your place in it. If you dont offer incredibly relevant messages that really mean something to your customer, theyre going to dismiss your company as irrelevant, too. But theres a major drawback when marketers take the leap without a strategy  the VentureBeat report also found that 39 percent of marketers feel pressured to use more engagement platforms than they can comfortably manage, and thats when focused, relevant communication starts to break down. And your customer will always notice. The problem? Your customers do not think, live, or shop in channels. No matter the touchpoint, the channel, or the device they use, a customer is still just one person, and you need to learn how to treat them that way. The answer isnt adding more channels  its understanding and managing the channels your customers are in, in extraordinary ways. Its understanding the power of communication on a granular level, and recognizing that the foundation of your business, from initial sale to eternal loyalty, boils down to basic human interaction. Offer the products and services your customers want, but also know what they need. This comes from a deep, intrinsic knowledge of the industry you operate in, so you understand your customers pain points, and know exactly how to soothe them. While on its surface omnichannel communication benefits the marketer  all those ways to get your message across, theres no way your customer can miss them!its really about giving customers a choice about where and when and how they want to communicate with you. Your customers notice when theyre getting the information they need, in the place where they want to be. More importantly, they notice when you dont  and thats the kind of service that sends previously loyal customers fleeing. So that means actively listening and engaging with your customers, prospects, and leads, which directly impacts your bottom line  because according to a report from Walker , by 2020, customer experience will overtake price and product as the key brand differentiator. How do you connect, listen and learn? Here are some of the channels where you need to be hanging on to your customers every word. 60 percent of marketers are still using social channels as a marketing tool , rather than a driver of customer experience, and thats why theyre leaving money on the table. The numbers dont lie: A study from Bain found that when companies engage and respond to customer service requests over social media, those customers spend 20 percent to 40 percent more with the company  and theyre almost three times more likely to recommend a brand, says HBR . And if you arent responsive on social media, youre going to see your churn rate increase by up to 15 percent . So change your focus from broadcasting to listening, and engage with your customers on the issues and interests that matter to them. Dashboards like Hootsuite can help you monitor mentions of your brand across all your social media profiles and stay on top of conversations and comments. Dimensional Research found that 88 percent of customers are influenced by online customer service reviews when making buying decisions, so you need to stay on top of your online mentions. Set up Google Alerts with your company and product names to keep track, and keep tabs on the places where your customers are most likely to talkfrom consumer review sites like Yelp, Insider Pages, and Angies list to directory services like Yahoo Local, Google Places, and Citysearch. Responding to reviews helps make customers feel heardand offering assistance to resolve any issues develops tremendous goodwill. Being open to direct customer contact, where and how they want to reach you, is one of the most important ways to establish authentic engagement and productive two-way conversations. Make contact links prominent across your site and on all of your social media profiles, as well as add a way for customers to contact you from an email or push notification. You can also consider soliciting opinions via customer surveys and polls. Request feedback directly in notifications, and even use the Facebooks Questions feature to pick your users brains. Customers choose communication channels based on what they need to accomplish, so all avenues of contact need to be easy for consumers to find, be reliable, and be easy to use. More traditional communications channels, which include phone, email, and chat, offer a level of comfort for the customer and simpler access to your company. eDigitals Customer Service Benchmark found that live chat is a particularly popular avenue for customers, because it provides near-instant response times, clear answers, and an easy way to ask further questions or for clarification. But the phone is both the most traditional communication platform of them all, and the most neglected. Nonverbal cues such as tone variations and pauses offer essential conversational clues to enrich the experience. And there really isnt much that can beat that feeling of direct, one-to-one focused connection that makes a customer feel truly heard. Active listening packs a huge punch for your business. Youre taking all the noise of marketing and sales and turning it into a real connection with your customers  the fundamental building block of sales and long-term loyalty. Its omnichannel done right.

The very next day (Friday) you have the sudden urge to shop. You continue to shop until you eat the Christmas turkey or ham. The urge to shop is then terminated. Where does the conspiracy come into play? Theres a secret chemical in the Thanksgiving turkey that creates an urge to shop. Theres another offsetting chemical in the Christmas turkey or ham that cancels the urge. My retrodicted (see definition below) logic says it is not a coincidence that Butter Ball and Shopping Mall just happen to rhyme. Ok, now to get serious. Seventy percent of all family discretionary dollars are spent during the five weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Every big box and major retailer knows that. They plan all year for that critical time. Whether the grand total of yearly sales are up or down depends on only five of the 52 weeks. The stock market holds its breath waiting for the final annual sales numbers before predicting what the future will bring. Heres the sad part. Few small, independent retailers leverage those five weeks. If they did the entire U.S. retail sales numbers would increase dramatically. In years past those retail businesses not directly involved in selling traditional Christmas gift items appear to have believed they were not involved in this intense and compressed shopping fever. Instead they proceeded by considering it to be business as usual. In years past, specialty retailers, those who dealt in enthusiast products or hobby items, did not cater to other members of their customers families. Today family shopping is the norm. What that means is many of the sales people will be dealing with customers who know little or nothing about the products the store sells. It will mean the sales person is going to need know the level of knowledge these uninformed customers and carefully guide them without appearing to be talking down to them. How is that accomplished? By asking questions early on and holding off making suggestions until the sales person has a clear picture of what the customer knows and doesnt know. The reality of todays retailing is that all segments of the retail market are seasonal. Snow-blowers are not sold in May. Lawn mowers are not sold in November. Coats sell as cold weather approaches and bathing suits as the days get longer. Heres what should, in my experience and opinion, be considered. First, there should be a meeting of all the stores personnel a week or so before Thanksgiving. That meeting must contain the following thoughts: 1. Everyone who enters the store will be greeted immediately. 2. Christmas decorations will festoon the interior of the store. 3. Christmas music will be played  ad nauseam. 4. Everyone will be instructed that the customer is the ONLY focus. 5. Creative thinking will be for the benefit of the customers choices. 6. The coffee pot will be filled regularly. 7. Candy will be next to every cash register. 8. Gift-wrapping will be encouraged. 9. Gift certificate purchases will be encouraged. 10. Three weeks before Christmas staff will wear Christmas hats. 11. There will be no days off. 12. The hours will be longer. 13. Smiles are mandated. 14. Customers will be short-tempered and stressed. 15. Those on the sales floor will act like Santas elves. 16. Staff will celebrate Christmas after the first of the year. These are the harsh realities of retail sales during this five-week period of time. No other country has this tradition, or at least not observed as intensely.

The dollar was firm against some global currencies after the US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen indicated that the interest rates could rise in coming months. Forex dealers said month-end demand for the US currency from importers and a lower opening in the domestic equity market put pressure on the rupee. On Friday, the rupee had closed almost flat at 67.06 against the US currency in restricted activity. Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell by 60.39 points or 0.21 per cent to 27,721.86 in opening trade today.","Not so fast Amazon! Earlier this week, the ecommerce giant claimed it is at some point in the future. While some may still consider the idea silly and impractical, one of Amazons biggest delivery partners apparently does not. The buzz on the Web suggests UPS, which handles much of Amazons current delivery along with FedEx, has also been testing flying drones. A spokesman for UPS The Verge recently: The UPS vision for flying drones in the package delivery process seems quite different, however.One expert suggests the company is much more likely to use these vehicles to make deliveries from airport to distribution hubs, media sources report. Earlier this week, Chris Ciaccia of The Street, UPS and FedEx would not sit still and watch a major customer cut them out. FedEx has apparently also looked at unmanned aerial delivery. Still others maintain the idea is simply impractical and wont save money or improve efficiency at all. Marcus Wohlsen of Wired drone delivery doesnt make sense for Amazon because: Instead, Wohlsen insists Amazons announcement had more to do with an effort to dominate the news cycle. The announcement broke in time for Cyber Monday, one of the most important shopping days of the year. And suggested additional ulterior motives. Whatever the outcome, small businesses are probably better off with shippers like UPS and FedEx also looking at cutting costs. Lower costs and higher efficiency for these companies means small businesses that need to ship to customers wont be left out in the cold.","Trying to ignore FourSquare in 2010 feels a bit like trying to ignore Twitter in 2009  its impossible. And trying to do so should be considered at your own risk. FourSquare and geolocation marketing is everywhere and its all any of the bit tech sites can talk about. The problem is, trying to FourSquare as a SMB owner in 2010 is a bit like trying to understand Twitter when it first came out  its all a little confusing and overwhelming.  As a SMB owner you want to know if this is all just hype or if there are practical ways to leverage this new platform to connect with customers. The answer its NOT just hype. And yes, you can! Here are some practical, low budget ways to take advantage of the FourSquare action. Because staying with the times shouldnt mean you have to drop everything you were already doing. Even if you dont plan to really use FourSquare, you should take the time to make sure your business is listed correctly.  Having a FourSquare business listing today is similar to having one in Google or Yahoo Local.  Being there simply allows you to be found.  Youll also get some added search engine visibility as Google Local is now indexing FourSquare business profiles and the pages tend to rank pretty well.  Were also seeing FourSquare shouts count as citations for local businesses.  The combination of these will deliver a great SEO boost. In order to add your business (if its not already listed), youll need to create a personal account on the site.  When you do so, make sure to fill everything out as completely as possible and add a picture (of yourself, not a business logo).  Without a picture, FourSquare limits your ability to earn badges or become the Mayor of a location.  Once youve created a profile youll be able to to the site. Besides just adding your address information, youll also be prompted to include a Twitter handle and relevant tags that will help people to find you.  People will often search for these tags in order to find relevant businesses so make sure youre adding things people would actually search for.  Once youre finished, save your listing and congratulate yourself for getting set up on FourSquare.  The most common way to use FourSquare as a SMB owner is to look at it as a new school loyalty program.  By registering offers and specials with the site, you can entice users to keep coming back to your establishment in order to earn new rewards or free items.  Whether its a free coffee for every 10th visit or a discount on their purchase,  customers like being rewarded for their continued patronage. Coupons . To add a FourSquare special to your business, simply click on the link on the right hand side of the page.   By making it official on FourSquare, your offer will appear in the Specials Nearby box that pops up when someone checks into a business near yours. This, obviously, can become very powerful.  Someone is far more likely to stop into your store for a free coffee when theyre in the area than when theyre sitting in their office or at home.   FourSquare gives you a way to easily target the people who are hanging out in your neighborhood (and perhaps near a competitor!). My favorite component of FourSquare is the ability to leave tips for people when they come in. My partner recently wrote about this on the Outspoken Media blog. She wrote about how in a recent trip to the Orlando airport she became a simply because she was able to use tips that other visitors had left. These tips helped her to not only get through security faster, but it created a better overall airport experience because she was in the know and could feel like a regular. Business owners can provide the same type of experience for their customers.  Leave a tip about the best times to come in for a quick coffee, highlight the groups that gather on certain days, reveal where to find all the best electrical outlets if someones coming with a laptop, etc.  Anything that betters someones experience with your business is good for your business.   I recommend that you disclose somewhere that you are leaving the tip as someone associated with the business, as not to come off as deceptive. However, if you make it an Official Tip or a Behind The Scenes Tip, it could become part of the game and increase the fun. Even if youre not going to use FourSquare to retain and attract customers, you should be monitoring your page to see the activity going on. If youre listening to people complain that folks are hogging the Wifi during lunch, maybe you need to put a coworking policy in place during certain hours of the day. If people are wishing that you offered pizza slices and not just whole pies, maybe you want to consider a special lunch menu to focus on that.  Looking at the comments left for others gives you a pretty unfiltered look into what people like/dislike about your business. Use it. Last month FourSquare to help SMB owners gain insight into how customers were interacting with their businesses and to make it easier to engage back.  By tying users to specific actions it helps business owners get to know them better and gives them a stronger way to market toward them. I think the four tips above should give most SMB owners an easy way to interact with and leverage FourSquare in a way that is useful to them.  Just because its new doesnt mean it has to be confusing.","Were used to thinking about Google as a search engine. And of course, we also think of Google for products such as Google Apps for Work, and the AdWords advertising platform. But when was the last time you thought of Google as a source of shopper insights and behaviors? And as a resource to help you sell more? These insights from Google are the subject of an interview I conducted recently withSebastien Missoffe, Director of SMB Sales at Google. He says theres a wealth of information you can learn from Google tools (free ones, at that). Beyond the tools, there are some key trends about how shopping behavior has changed in recent years. Understanding and leveraging these trends is one key to more successful selling in a small business. According to Missoffe, its important to think about the Web as a place where shopping never sleeps. Missoffe, whos been with Google nine years and was with LOreal before that, says that shoppers aresavvier and more informed today. They are also more connected online than ever before. Shopping just doesnt stop once the shops are closed, Missoffe said. One thing we are seeing is that one third of all the searches related to shopping happen between 10 pm and 4 am, said Missoffe. And night owls arenot just window shopping. People are buying in the middle of the night, too. Roughly one in seven orders happens between 10 pm and 4 am, headded. People are also shopping well past Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The image above (from a ) shows which days were peak shopping days last year. The days in red saw the most shopping online. The days in green saw the most shopping in store premises. Google Trends is a free service and hidden gem forsmall business sellers, says Missoffe. Whenever we bring it to the attention of small businesssellers, the first question is are you sure its free?, he added. What you can do with Google Trends is, first, search for your brand name and product names to see when and where people are searching. Evenif your brand is not yet well-knownenough to show up in Google Trends, Missoffe suggests looking for the search terms relevant to your business. You can see which terms, including related terms, shoppers are searching for, what country or region they are from, what days they search, and other insights. Learning thatcan tell you what kinds of search terms to use in your website copy, in your AdWords ads, in email messages, and other selling activities. If youre not familiar withad extensions, these are references to popular sections of your site that shoppers do searches for. They appear right in Google AdWords. See the example for immediately above, with four ad extensions within an AdWords ad, circled in red. There are several advantages to ad extensions. They take up more real estate on the page, giving more visibility to your business. Beyond that, they let shoppers click directly to what they might be interested in. Peloton Cycle, which sells stationery bicycles and streams livecycling classes into customers homes, also uses a technique called broad match modifier keywords. These allow an ad to show up in searches that include a keyword and certain variations such as +buy and +holiday when shopping for fitness solutions this holiday. One thing that small businesses may not realize is how much AdWords has improved on the back end, said Missoffe. We sometimes hear from small businesses that we love AdWordsbut it takes a long time, and Id just like them to know that we have solutions. Missoffe added that newtechnology has been built into the back end of meaning that you no longer have to do certain tasks. The technology within AdWords cando it for you. The amount of technology within AdWords has reducedsignificantly the time investment that small businesses now need to make, Missoffe said. For example, he noted, You dont have to decide by yourself what bid to make at what time of day  you can let AdWords handle that on your behalf.

I am demotivated because of my unpaid bills, the outstanding rent of my flat which I have been avoiding paying for more than a week giving the landlord some excuse or the other; my cell phones outgoing calls are barred; my team has already abandoned me; most people think, I am a fool. I wonder if theyre right; and Im actually crazy. When I can get a good job and a decent salary why am I continuing with entrepreneurship? I can easily have a comfortable life, yet here I am, hungry and dejected and with hardly any money to buy food. The precious Rs 50 in my pocket cant be spent on food since I have to go to Rajpura to meet a school coordinator the next morning. I have conducted a free introductory workshop there and I know that they normally make payments for school registration after a week.I am trying to think up reasons I can give the coordinator, asking for an early payment. : I set my alarm for 6 am and try to sleep. The next morning I get upwith feeling that everything is alright, I recite the asking the gods for support and strength and after getting ready, start walking towards the bus stop which is approximately two kilometers away. Yes, in a bid to save some money. I have no energy left but in my heart there is hope that things will turn for the better. I need to focus on my meeting. I board the bus and buy a ticket to Rajpura for Rs 35; which leaves me with Rs 15 in my pocket. The school is on the outskirts of the city and Im expecting the bus to drop me at the gate. Suddenly, I am alarmed to find that the bus has taken a different route. When I ask the conductor if that is so, he stops the bus and advises me to get down right there. So here I am, around three kilometers away from the school, stranded on the highway, wondering what to do. I start walking when a friend (who is aware of my financial status)calls up and when I tell her how things are, she asks me with great sadness how I will manage. I tell her that if the school coordinator accedes to my request for an early payment then it will be fine otherwise I will have to walk all the way back to Chandigarh and see what I can do next. She starts crying on the phone and I tell her not to worry. After walking a kilometer, I run into a man on a scooter who is kind enough to give me a lift. He drops me in front of the school building. Praying to Lord Shiva to handle things, I walk in.  I am inside the school, planning strategies. If the school coordinator says he will pay me after a week, I will tell him Ive forgotten my wallet at home and request him for Rs 500. Or maybe, Ill tell him that since there is no ATM near the school, I have not been able to withdraw money so would he at least give me the fare to go home. All these things are running in my head while I wait in his cabin when he enters; and the first thing he says changes everything. He says, Kshitij, it is so wonderful that youve come. Please collect the Rs 25,000 we have collected so far. Believe me, I am in tears.","Not that this is a surprise, since analysts have been saying since this weekend that the no is not the final no. Yahoo (NSDQ: YHOO) CEO Jerry Yang now says that it was Microsoft who left the negotiating table, and that his team was still open to discussing a deal. In an interview to Reuters , he said: If they have anything new to say, we would be open  I am more than willing to listen. Yang said he had spoken to many Yahoo shareholders since Saturday, and their reaction been all over the map. Yang said he is taking Ballmers withdrawal letter at face value and doesnt know if this is a negotiating tactic. My view is we are moving on and they said theyre moving on, he added. Meanwhile, the shareholder lawsuits have started, as expected: the first one out of the gate are two public pension funds represented by law firms Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP and Bouchard Margules & Friedlander, P.A. The two pension funds are Police & Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit and the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit. Details here . Then, the big institutional shareholders of Yahoo seem to be angry, this WSJ story says : Im extremely disappointed in Jerry Yang, said Gordon Crawford, a portfolio manager at Capital Research Global Investors, which owns over 6 percent of Yahoos shares. I think he overplayed a weak hand. Then Yang, also in an interview to WSJ, did the dialback: We as a company and I personally have always been open to a deal with Microsoft and I hope that the last few days it was clear that we have shown were willing to do a deal with Microsoft but that we couldnt get to an agreement on price. Update : The Yang tour continues: NYT reports on Yangs version of a Ballmer rejection: They chose to walk away after we put a price on the table, and they didnt want to negotiate.  From my perspective, we were open all along to selling to Microsoft (NSDQ: MSFT). We just feel Yahoo, either stand-alone or with Microsoft, is worth more than what they put on the table. Of course, it was Microsoft that raised its bid and Yahoo that dug in on the much higher price. And more from Crawford, challenging the Yahoo account of shareholder react: I would love to know who these shareholders are.  it","Gary Vaynerchuk, the entrepreneur who launched his career from his familys liquor store, has started a $25 million seed investment fund along with RSE Ventures. that the fund will focus on operating and incubating startups in what he is calling the Vayner/RSE joint fund.

Those who still use the system for log-in will have a little time to adjust. Drebes said the service will not officially be shut down until February 1, 2014. In the end, MyOpenID did not fail to gain traction because of lack of acceptance for Open IDs. The company was founded in 2006 to help make sign-in easier for Internet users. But since then sites like Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn and Yahoo have all embraced Open ID standards, Drebes said. By 2009 it had become obvious that the vast majority of consumers would prefer to utilize an existing identity from a recognized provider rather than create their own myOpenID account, he wrote. He says the company later switched to a business model based on social media log-in. Drebes said the company is delaying shut down of MyOpenID out of consideration for existing users.

If you are in favor of the Internet Sales Tax bill, be prepared to have your patience tested. Earlier this week, the .But the House of Representatives, which would also have to pass the bill before it could become law, may just throw a monkey wrench into the legislation. that Speaker of the House John Boehner (R- OH) will send the Senate version of the legislation to the House Judiciary Committee, likely stalling the bill. Boehner, who opposes the bill like many other Republicans in the House, may wish to delay any vote on the measure. There is no timetable for a potential vote in the House of Representatives. The Internet Sales Tax bill would allow individual states to require e-commerce merchants to collect and pay state sales taxes even if merchants dont possess a physical presence in the state. Current legal doctrine mostly requires a physical presence. The proposed bill exempts small businesses with less than $1 million in sales in states that collect sales tax. The official title of the bill is the Marketplace Fairness Act. But fairness is in the eye of the beholder. The eCommerce giant initially fought the concept of an Internet sales tax, but more recently came out in favor of the measure. Some speculate the reason is that Amazon is planning to build warehouses in every state in order to enable same day delivery and thus would have to collect sales taxes anyway. The bill would give Amazon a competitive edge, due to its huge resources and technology, over smaller retailers not as easily able to handle the burdens. Retailing giants WalMart and Best Buy are also in favor of the measure becuase they already collect sales taxes due to stores in every states. Its said that brick and mortar small businesses also favor the bill. However, since there is no single voice for small retailers its hard to say how strongly or . The affiliate marketing industry also supports the bill, because 76,000 affiliate sellers have been cut off from advertising revenue due to states that already have attempted to pass laws imposing sales taxes. Rather than pay sales taxes, large merchants simply discontinue their affiliate programs with small web publishers in the affected states that individually passed laws. include online sellers, and sites like eBay,where millions go to sell merchandise today and mostly do it free of sales tax. They would have the burden of having to figure thousands of tax options (for 9600 state and local taxing jurisdictions), remitting taxes, and being subject to audit, paperwork and regulatory enforcement by them. Theysee it as a tax grab by state governments looking for more tax revenue. Former Vice President candidate against the Internet Sales Tax on her Facebook page this week, where her post already has generated over 1,400 comment. She said, This new internet tax is not only another barrier to entry for smaller online start-ups, its a disincentive to grow a company. This will hit these smaller companies right where their margin of profit is, which means that this will cost jobs because when businesses lose profitability, they lay off workers or shut down. I would add, as a former co-owner of a retail shop in a small town: while 80% of our sales were local, 20% were online. And that was a decade ago  it likely would be a much higher percentage of sales online today. So its not just about online entrepreneurs. And while the $1 million sales exemption may sound high, remember, this is retail. That might translate into $150,000 net to a retailer  maybe less. The retailer may employ only a handful of employees. Thats hardly a huge business.","Corporate brandingits all the rage these days.  Social media blogs wax on about the companies doing it right, the companies doing it wrong, and the companies that have yet to get involved at all. As a small business owner, it can be a little intimidating.  How do you go about building a brand while building a business at the same time?   Well, there a few places you should start. Below youll find five ways to begin building your brand online.  Youll actually find its pretty painless. You cant build a brand if you dont know what youre trying to build. Social media is about amplifying your voice in a way that connects with customers. So what do you want your voice to sound like? Who are you in your space and what do you want people to associate with you?  Everything you do on the Web and off of should work to strengthen that.  Your actions now have a purpose  to create the identity youre after. Once you know this, you have a road map for everything else. The power of listening is twofold.  First, listening allows you to understand your community. By being quiet and eavesdropping on the conversations theyre already having, you can find out whats important to them, what they value, what they think about your competitors, how they view you in the market, what theyre struggling with and what their problems are.  The intel they reveal is often far more trustworthy than what theyre telling you to your face.  What people say and what they do is often quite different. This allows you to listen in and gain information without having your presence alter their natural behavior. Second, listening can help you find problems in your own system.  You can identify areas where customers struggle and things that constantly trip them up, and then fix the problems.   Monitoring what people are saying about you is a great way to learn and make your company better. Listen to their words and watch behaviors to find opportunities for growth and interaction. Where are your customers online? Where are they talking about you and discussing problems theyre having? These are the sites you want to find. They might be on Twitter, on LinkedIn or on their own blogs. Wherever your customers are talking about you is where you need to be and where you should get involved. Once you find out where your audience is, become part of that community. Get in the conversation and build those important relationships that breed loyalty. By becoming part of your customers online communities you set your company up as one that is human, accessible and trustworthy. Thats the basis upon which everything else will be built. When youre participating in online communities, keep an eye out for your brand evangelistscurrent customers who love you and enjoy spreading the word about you to their friends.  Once you find these people, befriend them. Thank them for what they do for your company and find ways to help them do it better. That may mean making them part of your process or giving them special access to parts of your brand.  The best way to build your brand is to make it easy for others to do it for you. Whether its an idea, a video, a quirk, a corporate value, whatever, you need to give your tribe of people something they can pass along.  Doing so will unite them around your company and strengthen your brand identity. People align themselves with companies that make them something.  Once you figure out the feeling you want to inspire (see #1 above), think about how you can make that feeling part of your customers daily interactions with you. If youre new to this corporate or personal brand thing, the five tips above can help you get started on creating a brand image that will resonate with users.","Youve probably encountered this problem. You are searching for a software tool. Lets say youre looking for project management software. You go to Google or Bing. After an hour of jumping back and forth between the search engine and a handful of websites, youre confused. Some sites talk about time tracking. Others talk about milestones. Still others talk about collaboration suites. You dont have a way to see a snapshot at a glance and compare apples to apples. Whats worse is that you have no idea what else is on the market that you might be missing. Enter . Chekkt was just launched last week. Its designed to be a marketplace for business owners and managers to search for, discover and compare online software to manage a business. According to Ori Manor, Chekkts founder and CEO, the company is solving an all-too-common pain point, and one he experienced. While working in another company, he and his team discovered how difficult the process is to findbusiness software. That, he said in an interview, is when he came up with the idea of Chekkt. He and his team were having trouble finding business management software that they needed. For startups and businesses today its hard to discover business software services that are available on the market. Its even harder to find out if they are relevant to your business, he said. Manor decided to do something about it and pulled together a group of investors, including , a company he is a partner in, along with Israel Tech Trust and a few others. They raised a seed investment round of $1.25 million in June of 2013. Thats when work began in earnest to design the B2B marketplace platform. The Tel Aviv based company started out by attracting vendors to the site. Today the site has information from 1200 vendors, like this one ofHeatSync. Chekkt is designed for buyers from small and midsize businesses, startups, agencies and freelancers. Chekkt wants to consumerize the search for business software. We want to make buying B2B software as easy as buying a consumer product, said Manor. Chekkt sees itself evolving into more than just information and reviews, but a place thatmakes the process of subscribing easier and faster, too. Other software directories and marketplaces are on the market, but Manor thinks they are designed to serve other purposes. Extension marketplaces may be run by one large software service or platform, and list those with integrations or APIs to their software  think IntuitApps.com. Other marketplaces, such as GetApp, are review sites. Manor insists that Chekkt will be different. Today it has information on thesoftware services, including what the software does and pricing. Chekkt also has special offers for some software (see pictured below). In the future, Chekkt has plans to allow buyersto subscribe to and pay without leaving the site, and it will even open up the usersaccount with the vendor automatically. Eventually, Chekkt plans tocharge a transaction fee if the purchase of an online software subscription is made through the site. Right now, a priority for the company isto growthe number of vendors in the site. Thats essential, Manor says, to serving buyers. Buyers want to go to the biggest marketplace where they find the most choices, Manoradded. Manor says its hard to determine how many business process software products there are on the market today. Our best estimate is 30,000 to 50,000 vendors, Manor told us. Its a huge market. According to a Gartner report, its a $129 billion industry annually, just for business process software services. But the market is fragmented. Theres no single place to find and buy every software. Vendors can submit their software service via this form. Chekkt does not a charge a fee to be listed as a vendor and, according to Manor, he does not foresee that changing. Vendors will have opportunities to purchase premium services and enhanced visibility. Were coming from a sincere place, Manor told us here at Small Business Trends. We know that running a business means juggling many balls at once, and if you move one ball everything can collapse. Were trying to make it easier for startups and small businesses to find softwarethey can leverage to run better and faster, and grow.","Were back with another 1-on-1 interview. This weeks guest is Tom Byun, Vice President of Yahoo! Small Business. He joined me in a live Hangout, and yes, we have video! According to Tom, Yahoo! Small Business serves over 1 million small business customers, primarily from the U.S. Yahoo! helps them with their online presence, Web hosting, and eCommerce solutions. Yahoo! also assists small businesses in driving more sales, he told us. Yahoo! serves small businesses of all sizes  from solo entrepreneurs to ones with many employees  from local businesses to online businesses. Many of them fall in the 10-employee-or-under size range, however. Below are a few highlights of that discussion, paraphrased in places. We have a large group of merchants that [we serve] and year over year, were seeing double digit growth, but it is slowing down. Another trend were observing is  we all know with the Internet that theres been a fair amount of fragmentation in terms of services that small businesses use to get customers. Back in the old days, you just put up your listing on the Yellow Pages or the White Pages and thats how people called you. But now with the proliferation of Internet services, you have everything from search and SEO and now with social and mobile, the acceleration of mobile, there just continues to be more and more outlets for small businesses to access customers. Whats top of mind is  they want to know [what it takes] to get that next sale. Its all about getting that next customer. They want to be able to cut through the clutter and just find one or two tools that can help them. And often the advice I start with is, focus on the fundamentals. Youve got a business to run . And you only have so much time in the day. So just focus on some very basic things to attract that next business that you need. Social media is clearly important and its clearly playing a more critical role. Putting links on social media  is becoming a vehicle for driving traffic to their business.  Thats how a lot of small businesses are being found. But when you think about social, think about which customers you are going after.  I was meeting with a merchant  theyre in the  wholesale lighting business. Facebook is not necessarily a place where theyre going to try to do online sales.   So really understand your audience.  Start out with which audience youre going after, and which medium youre going to use. Small businesses are still struggling  with marketing  [having only so many dollars to spend]. Focus on the fundamentals. Things like directories. Youd be amazed if you  look at stats  a lot of consumers are still finding [businesses] through directories. A lot of these directories are being accessed not only through desktop, but  through mobile access points.","Were entering the home stretch of 2012. The next two months are hectic for everyone, but particularly for small business owners. While its easy to become overwhelmed with end of the year sales (not to mention holiday planning and parties), business owners should take some time to make sure their business is legally fit for 2013. After all, what better gift could you give your business than a fresh start for the New Year? Heres a checklist of legal aspects for small businesses to consider before the calendar hits 2013: Many small businesses start out as sole proprietorships or partnerships, but then eventually transition to another entity. For example, if your business is not incorporated, you may want to (either as a C Corp, , or to shelter you from some financial risk and possibly give you more flexibility when it comes to taxes. Discuss the different legal entities with your CPA, so you can determine the right entity for your situation and the right time to make the change. You can look into a delayed filing option with a document-filing company. This means that you can get all of your paperwork submitted now and it will be held and filed on the first business day of 2013, allowing you to start fresh next year. This will simplify your paperwork and tax filings, as your business will have the same business structure for the whole year. Did you start a business a few years ago, but its no longer operating? Even if youre not actively promoting the business and it has no revenue, you still need to file a formal termination of that LLC or Corporation. Otherwise, you will be charged fees associated with the business, youll still be expected to file an annual report, and youll still need to submit tax returns to the IRS and state. If you have an inactive business, you should file an Articles of Dissolution or Certificate of Termination document with the Secretary of State where your Inc. or LLC was formed. In most cases, youll need to settle any owed taxes before you can do this. You should also cancel any kind of permit or licenses you hold with the state or county. Again, make sure to take care of these matters while its still 2012. Theres simply no reason to pay an extra cent in fees toward a business youve essentially retired  theres a lot more you can do with that money! If youve gone through the work to incorporate your business, make sure you keep it in good standing. Keeping good corporate books is a frequently overlooked corporate activity. The end of the year is a good time to hold your annual meeting for your Corporation or LLC. Along with the meeting, youll need to generate written minutes/resolutions to be signed by the shareholders (Corporation) or members (LLC). If you made any changes to your Corporation or LLC ? for example, you changed your business address, authorized more shares, or a board member left ? youll need to file an official notification with your state of incorporation. In most states, this paperwork is known as Articles of Amendment. While this type of paperwork may seem pretty trivial, its critical to keeping your LLC or Corporation in good standing (and thus protecting your personal assets). Now that were nearing the end point for 2012, review what your business has made year to date and assess your to avoid underpayments or overpayments. Youll want to adjust your final 2012 payment (due Jan 15 ) as needed. The next two months are a perfect opportunity to tie up any loose ends youve been putting off throughout the year. For example, does your business need a (or )? Did you get a Tax ID number (Employer ID Number)? Are all your necessary licenses and permits in order? The next few months will be busy, but set aside some time to take care of your business legal and administrative activities. By addressing certain issues in 2012, you might be able to save money in fees, taxes, and penalties moving forward. And in other cases, youll be preparing your business for a fresh start in 2013!","Small businesses can use social media to boost sales and gain attention from potential customers. Unfortunately, a lot of small businesses make mistakes when trying to harness the power of social media. Some of those are rookie mistakes that are easy to avoid, if you just are conscious of them and work to handle them differently. Below are 5 of the biggest small business social media mistakes to avoid. Using social media well takes a lot of time. Thats a resource that small businesses rarely have. Its usually best to focus on doing one or two things well instead of using every social media platform available to you. Instead of doing a bad job on five social media platforms, focus on one that you already know how to use. If you have time later, you can always decide to branch out. To use social media properly, you need to know what works and what doesnt. That means you have to measure the success of your strategies. If you find that your Twitter posts dont inspire customers, then stop wasting time on them. If you see that your website gets a lot of attention after you post a video on Facebook, then you should spend more time and money doing that, instead. Your company needs a coherent branding term that takes advantage of social media. When you set up profiles, make sure you fill out every piece of information. Most social media sites will give you the chance to include your logo, images, website links and business description. Taking advantage of these opportunities will help customers identify your business. Filling out your companys profile can also help people find you online. If you skip any aspect of this, then youll lose at least one sale. Thats one too many. Social media isnt about you constantly sending messages to your customers. Its about starting a conversation. That means you have to pay attention to what people post on your profile. You should thank people for their kind words and address comments from disgruntled customers. It doesnt look good for bad comments to sit on your page. If you address those comments with positive, affirmative messages, you caneducate your target audience and placate unhappy customers. This is also a great opportunity for you to learn more about what your customers want. If you dont pay attention to them, youll never learn from their suggestions. Social media is a commitment that requires a little time every day. If you dont have time to submit a post or send a tweet, then you shouldnt even bother getting involved. Yes, people expect businesses to have profiles on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms, but its better to disappoint them than to ignore them. When customers see an inactive profile, they could assume that youve gone out of business. When they find out that you dont have a profile, they think, Why doesnt so-and-so have a Facebook profile?It might bewilder them momentarily, but it doesnt keep them away permanently.","Apple Inc. plans to introduce two curved phones possibly making them among the first such devices available in the U.S.Thats according to murmurs in the industry saying the tech giant is in the planning stages on the two new iPhones.

And now the company is admitting it. The Keurig 2.0 with its inability to accept third-party coffee, older K-cups, or reusable pods. Keurig is finally making an effort to fix at least one of these problems by bringing back the refillable My K-Cup. A of Keurigs fiscal second quarter this yearshows the company took a 23 percent hitin brewer and accessory net sales compared to last year. According to the report, 22percentof this loss was due to a decline in brewer sales volume. It seems this sharp fall off was a startling realization for Keurig. The problem with Keurig 2.0 iswith the machines DRM (Digital Rights Management) system. DRM makes it so Keurig 2.0 machines only accept official, and more expensive, Keurig K-Cups that are one-time use only. The consumer backlash to this decision was more than the company anticipated. President and CEO, Brian Kelly in an earnings call: In an effort to bring sales back, the company plans to reintroduce My K-Cup for Keurig 2.0 later this year. However, consumers will still have to buy the new My K-Cup to work in their machine. Older K-Cups and third party pods will also continue to be unusable. But consumers who are determined to use any pod they chose can try a popular hack that works around the DRM system. Basically by cutting the top off of an official K-Cup and securing it to the top of another pod, you can trick the machine into accepting it.

Keurig is attempting to correct itsmistake but it could be too little too late for some consumers. The company took away features many consumers loved about Keurig.

This week, Ohio Gov. John Kasich introduced his budget plan for the state for the next two years. In that budget was a call to eliminate income taxes for nearly all small businesses in the state. According to a from Cleveland.com, Kasichs plan would eliminate income taxes for small businesses with less than $2 million in annual gross receipts. The exemption includes pass through entities like sole proprietors, Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs), and Subchapter S corporations (S-corp.). These businesses would still have to pay Ohios commercial activities tax, so its not a completely tax-free environment. In a statement addressing his budget proposal for Ohio, Kasich said that his call for the elimination of the income tax on small businesses is meant to spur job growth. In the Blueprint for a New Ohio, an overview of Kasichs new budget proposal, the governors office (PDF): If the plan is passed as its currently written, Ohio expects to lose out on $696 million in tax revenue over the next two years with the elimination of this single tax. Besides additional hiring, the governors office is hoping the savings will free up additional capital for small business owners to reinvest to further grow their companies in the state. Kasich also wants his proposal to be a message to other would-be small business owners: that Ohio is kind to small businesses. He told Cleveland.com: Ohio could stand to be kinder to small businesses. According to a of the small business climate in all 50 states, Ohio received a C letter grade from Business Insider last year.","The phrase smarter, faster, cheaper sounds exactly like what any small business owner or entrepreneur (or manager or executive) wants in their business. We all want efficiency, speed and low cost, dont we? is also the name of the new book by (book website ). The subtitle Non-Boring, Fluff-Free Strategies for Marketing and Promoting Your Business is a description of whats inside this book. The author uses the phrase smarter, faster, cheaper often compared in the same sentence with the phrase dumber, slower and expensive to highlight the difference between todays marketing and traditional forms of marketing. Regular readers of will no doubt recognize the author. He is an expert contributor here. David Siteman Garland caught my attention with his exuberant upbeat attitude  an attitude that permeates this book. So I couldnt wait to dive in when he sent me an advance copy of his book. This is a marketing book. But marketing is a wide topic, so let me narrow it down for you. This book is heavily oriented toward marketing via creating online communities and online content. Although in a few places it covers offline marketing such as networking at events, the majority is geared toward the online world. John Battelle, Founder of Wired magazine, once made a crucial observation when he said that everybody is in the media business today.  If you expect to have your business found online and spur online word of mouth through social media, you have to be creating and sharing content. Its content that gets indexed in the search engines that your prospects and customers will search. Its content that customers consume online. And its content that people share and discuss online. Theres a huge, never-ending, 24/7/365 conversation going on; your business needs to be part of that conversation online. Let me put it to you this way. Today, without content you might as well be armed with a crossbow but no arrows in your quiver. You may aim, but youre going to find it hard to hit your target. And content is really where this book shines: when it discusses strategies and techniques for creating and promoting online content to market your business. But Davids book is different from, say, a how-to-blog or how-to-use-social-media book. Yes, you will get some tips for how to write successful blog posts online, how to create effective video, and how to use Twitter or YouTube. But this is primarily a book about marketing, so the emphasis is on strategies and tactics for promoting content and using content to build a community of loyal followers for your brand. This is a book thats always bringing you back to the big picture. At regular intervals, David forces you to step back and think about your overall business goals. For instance, in a chapter about online video, he says forget viral, focus on function. Sure, we might dream of a video that goes viral and gets a million views. But as David points out, the real value of video is providing content for a targeted market. That sounds deceptively simple  you might even think simplistic. But I think its a profound point that more businesses should pay attention to. I see this come up all the time with small businesses that get sidetracked by attempts to create viral videos or link bait articles. While funny or outrageous, they may not get you any more customers. Worse, they may even be a turn-off for serious prospects. And theyre certainly a misuse of your precious company resources of time and money if they are off base message-wise. I mentioned Davids exuberance  well, that comes through in the book like a cheerleader with a megaphone. Part of the reason his personality comes through so well is the informal writing style. It makes the book very readable, with its me-to-you style in sentences like this: Another thing I liked about this book is the down-to-earth advice. For instance, in a section on how much time you should spend content, such as blog posts and videos, versus it, David writes: Content is fundamental to any online marketing strategy today. You have to become good at creating content. But creating alone is not enough. You must be adept at spreading your content widely, and starting and engaging your market in conversations. In short, your business must develop a competency in marketing your content. And thats .","LG is trying its hand again at a curved smartphone. It may be one of the few times when the sequel bests the original.The company is following the unimpressive debut of the LG G Flex with the LG G Flex 2. The in Las Vegas. The latest smartphone  actually a with its 5.5-inch display  seeks to upgrade the experience many got from . That experience was lackluster, but the sequel is a real improvement, Engadget, In a company release announcing the new device, LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company president and CEO Juno Cho : For the G Flex 2, LG has improved every aspect of the original. That includes actually shrinking the display, from a full 6 inches to 5.5. Where the original had a poor resolution by todays standards, the new Flex 2 has a full HD 1080p display. Of course, the Flex 2 is a curved device. So that puts the microphone closer to a users mouth and curved displays are designed to reduce distortion.Engadgets Chris Velazco adds that the Flex 2 is actually comfortable to hold against the face.As part of his review, he also notes that the back of the case is rather flexible and LG states that the 3,000 mAh battery is also flexible. The back of the G Flex 2also has a so-called self-healing feature. If the Flex 2 sustains any scratches on its back, the material from which its made has the ability to heal itself. This was a feature on the original Flex phone but on the new device, this has been improved. Where it used to take about 3 minutes for scratches on the back of the phone to heal, it now takes just roughly 10 seconds. And despite its ability to bend, the phone offers an apparent improve upon Cornings trademark Gorilla Glass. A chemical treatment process on the Gorilla Glass has worked enough for LG to claim that its display glass is 20 percent more durable than the original. LG also improved the quality of the camera on the G Flex 2 when compared to the original. The new phone will have a 13-megapixel rear-mounted camera that has LED flash and laser auto-focus. This helps getting images from objects in motion or in low light. The phone will be sold with either 32- or 64GB of storage and will be one of the first devices to be using the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor. The G Flex 2will be stocked with an almost original version of Android 5.0 Lollipop. There have been no prices announced. Nor is there any indication when the G Flex 2will be available. AT&T will likely be one of the to offer the device to its customers. AT&T announced a partnership to carry the phone on its service when its eventually available.","  LONDON Euro zone business activity expanded a touch faster than expected last month as the region appeared, so far, to have largely shrugged off Britain's vote to leave the European Union, a survey found. The latest increase, which came alongside some of the fastest hiring growth in the euro zone since before the financial crisis in 2008, was led by a surge in Germany, masking stagnation in France and a slower pace in Spain and Italy. Euro zone business growth is now in stark contrast to Britain, where a survey suggested its economy is shrinking at the fastest rate since the financial crisis after a sharp hit to activity following the EU referendum in June. [GB/PMIS] Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone, released on Wednesday, was 53.2 in July, above a flash estimate of 52.9 and June's 53.1. It has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013. ""The composite PMIs have held up a little better than people expected after the UK's Brexit vote but that doesn't change the fact that growth is still weak and not doing enough to pick up core inflation,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics. ""Even though the composite PMIs and surveys have done a bit better than expected that doesn't change the fact that there is still pressure on the ECB to take more action."" Last month, the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged but said more stimulus could be on the way. A July Reuters poll suggested it would soon be forced to extend and expand the scope of its asset purchase programme.  Despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy, inflation is nowhere near the central bank's 2 percent target ceiling and is not expected to get there until at least the end of 2017. Of some relief to policymakers though, a sub-index measuring output prices jumped to a 10-month high of 49.8 from June's 49.1, an indication firms barely cut prices. Economic growth in the euro zone halved in the second quarter to 0.3 percent and Markit said if sustained the latest PMI reading pointed to a similar pace in the current quarter. Last month's Reuters poll predicted the same.  GERMAN LEAD According to the PMIs, growth is being led by Germany, where a stronger expansion in services boosted private sector activity last month to its highest this year, although some companies were less optimistic following Britain's vote to leave the EU. But France's composite PMI barely tipped over the break-even mark while the Italian and Spanish ones both fell.  Across the euro zone, activity in the dominant service industry ticked up from June. Its PMI edged up to 52.9 from 52.8, higher than the flash 52.7 reading. In a sign service firms expect a further improvement this month, they increased headcount at the fastest rate since early 2008. The employment index rose to 53.7 from 53.1. ""The improved hiring trend suggests firms have gained sufficient confidence in the durability and sustainability of the upturn to expand capacity in increasing numbers,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist. But the euro zone has a long way to go to get unemployment down. It is at 10.1 percent, which masks great variety across member states. Unemployment is just above 6 percent in Germany but one in five people in Spain are out of work. Echoing the slow and steady picture painted by the PMIs, an official report from Eurostat showed retail sales - a proxy for household spending - were stable in June across the currency bloc. (Editing by Janet Lawrence)","The buzz in the world of WiFi at the moment isthis: Alarge number of cities across the globe are already offering free Internet connections through free city WiFi technology. Evenmore are expected to soon follow suit. The picture that comes tomind is that people will be roaming around with mobile devices that connect to the Internet through free city WiFi and, of course, unlimited browsing  everywhere. While traveling, almost everyone has the urge and necessity to check mails and share documents with others. Gone are the days when you could do this only while sitting at the desktop computer in your home. This is an age of mobile devices and people usually have many of these with them, such as the laptops, smartphones and others. Almost all of these are WiFi friendly. So, all they need to do is connect to an Internet service provider through the WiFi. With cities offering these services, Internet can now be available anywhere you wish. So, on-road WiFi is also becoming a reality with every passing day. Not everybody in a city can afford the Internet. Hence, there are many kids and adults who are not able to access it. However, with every passing day, steps are being undertaken to help make the Internet affordable for all. A large number of municipalities in different cities offer free WiFi for the inhabitants there. Do you really believe that theres something forfree? Theres no such thing as a free lunch or even a free WiFi. The government will have to spend a lot to set up infrastructures across entire cities. It is expected that the sum mayadd up to millions, if not billions. WiFi is offered through unlicensed broadcast spectrum or even sometimes through airwaves. A series of antennas need to be installed, which ensure that you will have access to high-speed Internet. These antennas are usually put on top of telephonepoles and similarother places. The location of the antennas need to be selected prudently. Depending on the position where it has been installed, an antenna can offer Internet across a coverage area of about 1,000 feet in radius. Doug Schremp: So, it clearly indicates that the government has to spend a lot of money to ensure that all the inhabitants of the city are able to access free Internet anywhere they wish inside the boundaries of the city. You cant expect the government to spend all that money without any expectation of getting something in return. There will surely be a steep rise in different types of taxes. Sointhe end, it really wont be free. One of the major disadvantages of public WiFi lies in its inability to offer proper security to the users. The people who are in charge of offering free WiFi to the inhabitants of acity are able to see each and every website that you surf or each and every click that you make on the Internet. So, the privacy of the users is usually not there withfree WiFi offered by the municipalities of different cities. With every passing day, different governments are trying hard to provide citizens with free WiFi, which has nearly become a basic necessity these days. And the advantages offered by these services seem to outweigh the cons.",", is the new book written by Anita Campbell, Publisher and CEO here at , along with award winning communications strategist David Langton. , Anita talked about the process of writing the book. Here in part 2, Anita and David answer questions on specific design examples covered in the book. David also shares some advice for small businesses about designing logos and marketing campaigns. Nothing.org is a regional bank food and a small nonprofit. Nothing refers to having nothing to eat. The marketing campaign depicting a can of nothing (i.e., a food can with the label Nothing on it) has meaning on several levels. First, theres an obvious play on words with a can of nothing. You expect a can to hold something. This one held  nothing. Then you also have the wit involved with how do you visually convey nothing? I mean, how do you draw nothing? Its hard. You need more than words to make an impact  you need an image. So there needed to be a way to make nothing seem tangible, to get people to donate. And since it is a food bank where people donate cans of food, the food can of nothing had double meaning. is a recording studio. For a marketing campaign they created a mailer made of cardboard that you assembled into a 45 record player. They included a vinyl 45-rpm record showcasing their recording capabilities. Whats a 45-rpm record, you ask? Its how people used to listen to music before iPods.Really technology. The takeaway from GGRPs strategy is not that it uses out-of-date technology. It was intentionally retro to get attention. And the retro technology related specifically to the business GGRP is in, so it was relevant. No, the real learning is that when doing direct mail, send out interactive lumpy mail. You may quickly forget a letter or postcard, no matter how well written. But arent you likely to remember a 45-rpm record player that you had to take a few minutes to assemble, and the message you heard using it? Creativity like that never goes out of date. Speaking of creativity, we wanted to get David Langtons advice on using visuals in marketing. I always tell businesspeople, Get professional help! And I dont mean therapy. Yet, creating a brand for your company is a lot like therapy. You must get in touch with the core reasons your business exists and create a brand that encompasses the core values and services you offer in ways that are attractive and distinctive to your primary audience is an image consultant  but just because she is an expert in establishing style and presentation for her clients does not mean she is a marketing or communication designer. She turned to professional designer Katrina Hase of Mix Creative to produce a new brand that has the right balance between casual and professional for Ditto & Co. Her brand provides a communication positioning that has increased her status as a speaker and a consultant. The biggest pitfall I see is that small businesses try to be everything to everybody. Focus on what you do best. Your business is defined by what you do  and by what you choose not to do. Success comes when you define what you do best and then deliver that service to a specific audience. Paula Bodnar Schmitt of the designed an abstract sign featuring the musical symbol for quarter note for the Quarternotes Loft apartments. This targeted music students and professionals who would certainly be aware of the meaning of the quarter note symbol as well as the clever wordplay on living quarters. By using the musical symbols, they targeted their message to the audience they wanted to reach, and the apartments were fully rented. The core design elements for creating a successful campaign are: All three elements must support each other. Your style should have meaning that supports the functions or goals and objectives of your campaign. The Renaissance Capital identity is a good example of how all three elements work together in a successful identity and marketing campaign. is a research firm that specializes in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). They believe that the founders and innovators of new companies like eBay, Google and Facebook are the Renaissance people of today. The new logo designed by my firm ( ) takes the letters I-P-O and evokes the style of a Greek Revivalist ionic column. By combining the heritage of Renaissance design with a modern style, the brand positions this research firm as the go-to source for IPO content. The new design, which also includes a streamlined and reorganized website, caught the attention of the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE), which has become a partner in offering services to a new market in Europe. The biggest mistake is to think that you are your best client. Designing a visual marketing campaign or identity should not be based on what you personally like. It should be about how your company and services are positioned for your target audience. Your visual marketing should be created to attract and persuade . Time and time again, clients think that they can design it themselves. Its important to step back and try to think like your own clients. Present your objectives and goals to your designers and marketing experts and let them present creative visual solutions back to you. Let the creatives be creative  and perhaps you will be surprised by fresh and innovative ideas that you never would have come up with on your own. is an idea trigger book. It gives you ideas for how to spice up your marketing, using images and design. If you walk away with just one or two new ideas, those ideas could result in tens of thousands of dollars  or more  in new business and profit. In that case, Anita and I have done our jobs, and thumbing through will be well worth it.

The new tool is called Google Web Designer. Neal Mohan, Googles Vice President of Display Advertising, pre-announced it : Google Web Designer is not exactly what the names implies  and that has created some confusion on the Web. Several sites reported it was a tool to design websites. However, its main purpose appears not to be about creating websites. Google already offers . Rather, Google Web Designer was pitched by Mohan as a tool to create rich media advertisements at last weeks Think DoubleClick industry event. This new product appears created to address the growth of mobile devices. Currently the DoubleClick Studio contains Flash tools for building rich media ads. According to Mohan in a video address to the audience , rich media ads are hot. There has been a 50% increase in engagement rating for rich media ads over the course of the past several months, he says. However, Flash-based creative has some limitations. Its not viewable on many mobile devices such as tablets (including Googles own Android platform), without users going through complicated work-arounds or installing special plugins.  HTML5 is important to enable rich media such as video-based creative to be readily viewable on mobile devices. Google Web Designer will allow agencies and advertisers to build advertising creative that can run across all modern devices and modern browsers in HTML5 format. It will be available within DoubleClick and as a stand alone tool. This new product is one more step in the growing range of advertising-related product offerings Google is building out under the DoubleClick brand. They were previewed last week at the Think DoubleClick event, after a brief review of the online advertising industry. As Mohan points out, people have been predicting  wrongly  the demise of display advertising almost since the beginning. Weve seen how all thats turned out, he notes humorously, adding that display advertising is a $200 billion industry opportunity. Mohan walked through the online-advertising history, starting with DoubleClick for Publishers, an application that started 15 years ago and three years after the first display ad debuted on the Web. Google acquired DoubleClick in 2008. Google AdSense, the Google ads that publishers place on their websites and the product many think of when they think about Google advertising, is 10 years old. If youre not familiar with DoubleClick for Publishers, it is an ad serving program that intelligently delivers ads on a website, tracks performance metrics such as click-through rates, provides reports, and more. AdSense ads can be delivered through DoubleClick for Publishers, or publishers can deliver their own direct-sold ads or house ads. Theres a main version of DoubleClick for Publishers. And theres also a free version called DFP for Small Business (Small Business Trends uses DFP for Small Business to serve ads on this site). In other news last week, Mohan announced Campaign Manager, which is the renamed and upgraded advertiser tool platform. Recognizing the importance of social, Google also has integrated Wildfire into DoubleClick, to get a better sense of how your social presence feeds into your advertising efforts. He says this is just the first step of the integration between Wildfire and DoubleClick  more to come. Also announced was better integration between advertising using YouTube video and DoubleClick.","Lets start with defining cloud computing. Cloud computing can simply be defined as a computing model in which services (e.g. web based email) and storage (e.g. web hosting) are provided over the Internet. When most small business owners or new software companies talk about cloud computing, they usually mean an application that runs from the web and not directly from your not-connected-to-the-Internet desktop (software as a service or SaaS). Cloud computing software solutions, for our purposes here, mean software that has a low monthly fee rather than a one-time capital expenditure. Just about any business function you can think of has a cloud based solution, from phone services to marketing to operations to finance. You may already be relying on cloud computing without even realizing it. Think about your email provider: Are they offering some sort of anti-spam protection? Or what about your anti-virus program? Are they constantly updating and securing your desktop application? They are delivering service from the cloud, without on-premise hardware and software. This is a great example of how SaaS has infiltrated our work and software installations without us thinking about it. In this guide, we suggest 16 things you should consider before deciding whether cloud computing is a good match for your business. Read more about how . Finally, beware of the hype. Cloud computing seems to be a flashy car on a used car lot. As with any new technological initiative that aims to sweep you away, its best to take that sweet car on a test drive first. It is estimated that the worldwide cloud computing market is $8 billion with the U.S. market accounting for approximately 40% of that: $3.2 billion. According to Gartners 2011 predictions, number one on their list of Top Strategic Technologies is . Gartner also predicts that the SaaS market will hit $14 billion in 2013. A recent of small businesses (1-99 employees) within US, UK, Germany, Italy and Brazil shows that only 37 percent of small businesses have heard about cloud computing. Among those who have heard about cloud computing, 13 percent said that they did not know what it meant. 44 percent of the respondents think that cloud computing means subscribing to services such as servers or storage hosted by a third party and 29 percent think that it means access to applications over the web. Even among the 29 percent of small business that use SaaS, not all of them have heard of cloud computing. According to , Even though this survey was based on 150 IT and networking professionals, it gives you some idea of how your small business staff might respond to SaaS offerings. The study revealed that 54% of respondents use two or more SaaS applications or other cloud-based services and only one third (34%) currently do not use any SaaS applications or cloud-based services. It would suggest that if an experienced technology professional at a larger enterprise would choose SaaS, then it could work for a smaller company as well. According to a , which has been covering the SaaS marketplace, SaaS usage or adoption in 2007 was 32% among their respondents and in 2008 had jumped to 62%. The most common reason why small businesses choose cloud computing solutions over desktop applications is this: It is less expensive because you pay a small monthly amount instead of a one-time fee as it works now with traditional desktop software. On a cash-flow basis, it is less costly because your cloud based apps are often slightly less costly than an annual purchase or upgrade for common programs. However, you have to look closely at the pricing plans and details for each application. Another common reason is that the SaaS application is often a simpler version of something that is installed on your machine and youre currently using. There are fewer bells and whistles, so to speak, and the developers of many cloud computing apps have created just the basics that customers need to get the specific job done. Salesforce.com, one of the market leaders in the cloud computing industry, had over 52,000 customers in 2009. Rackspace, a hosting provider, has over 1,000 SaaS apps in its new AppMatcher.com service. For some business users that operate virtual offices or operate remotely on different machines depending on location and they need the application to be accessible from a web browser. That is one of the biggest advantages of cloud computing it is available wherever you have access to a computer and browser. If you are not connected and operating your laptop offline, does the program offer a way to run it offline and synchronize when you are connected again? Many apps have either a mobile app or a widget you can download and run a lighter version of the software. For example, some Google Apps offer a desktop version called Google Gears, which will sync your data when you are back online. Google Apps, by the way, has over two (2) million businesses and 25 million users in its cloud computing marketplace; including companies like and , just to name a couple. Do you use all the features of your desktop app? If not, a cloud computing application might offer a forever free plan that allows you to do the same work as a desktop application, but limited in some way. For example, a billing solution might let you run an unlimited number of invoices, but for only 2 separate clients. You can find a range of great applications at . It offers a terrific directory of cloud based applications from accounting to versioning. This isnt to say that all apps that live in the cloud are more basic than their desktop equivalents. But that they often offer a slimmed down basic package that can help you get the job done when you dont need a more feature-rich version. For example, Outright offers a simple bookkeeping app thats free. But you can also integrate it with other financial SaaS apps to do more with it. Read the . . Many organizations are worried about the associated privacy and security risks that a cloud computing system brings when vital information is made accessible to a third party. Generally, if you operate in an industry that requires greater privacy or security standards and you find a cloud computing app vendor working with your industry, then theyve likely developed for that standard requirement. However, check the details to fulfill any legal, financial, or ethical concerns. Remember: Youre still responsible for making sure data is where it needs to be, whether thats onsite or in a cloud. Your cloud computing vendor is not responsible for your data, your security, your data privacy. They may promise certain aspects of security, but if you are a financial institution, for example, the buck stops with you when the regulators come calling. Make sure youre not violating any compliance concerns and that your datas safe. Google Apps Marketplace has a useful and how to evaluate a vendor or application. They point out areas to look at, such as: A vendor shouldnt ask for sensitive information via email, the app requires SSL (secure socket layer) technology by encrypting your data, robust customer reviews, and a clearly stated privacy policy and terms of service. One more perspective and advantage of operating in the cloud comes via a May 2010 that shared about how one small business owner had his store burglarized and eight desktops were stolen. He simply purchased eight new computers and was up and running in minutes, thanks to the cloud services he used, which included Salesforce.com, FinancialForce.com, and Quickbooks Online. Are you sure you want to invest your cash in this particular cloud computing software vendor? How long have they been in business? How many customers do they have? Can you talk to users directly? You can sometimes read the testimonials and get good information and if the testimonials are real, they will often link to the person who made the comment. While those individuals do not expect to be contacted by every interested prospect of a cloud computing app vendor, you may be able to talk to some of them. Do a search on Twitter or Facebook or Yelp. Twitter is probably the best, though. Many customer support departments are on Twitter to catch complaints or problems and try to solve them quickly. You can observe that comment stream by using . Tom Fisher, in a guest blog post at Sandhill.com, suggests you ask questions like: Can I see the resumes of the executives running your operations? or Can you brief me on the engineering team that will be delivering the critical application that Im betting my career on? This might be going a bit too far, however, you can be sure if youre using a mission-critical application that youll want to ask some tough questions and receive great answers. Uptime is the time a hosted applications performance record essentially. Most are in the range of 98-99.9%, which acknowledges that servers go down for maintenance or unexpected problems. How quickly do they fix the problem? This can be an issue for mission critical applications and youll often see the highest uptimes for apps that are in this category. They know how important their service is to customers. These are often covered in whats known as Service Level Agreements, or SLAs, so read those carefully and discuss changes with the vendor, if needed. In 2009, a small business survey conducted by , a leading provider of on-demand file server solutions, revealed that Inability to access data due to Internet outages (55%) and data security (55%) were the top two concerns cited among small businesses utilizing cloud computing software solutions. Is there an extra charge for support and maintenance or is that included in your monthly subscription fee? It is usually included, but like any purchase, read the fine print. Check if you have access to a customer support team via phone, email, or social media. You can add and subtract users, as needed (some call this scaling where you can increase your software license seats incrementally). Your monthly fees are dependent (usually) on how many users you have. Often, your capital outlay to purchase cloud based apps is lower than traditional on-premise or desktop apps. In terms of scaling with your needs, cloud computing is one elegant way to do that. Read more about . Cloud computing applications get updated and improved regularly and you benefit from every improvement without additional direct cost and without the effort of downloading and configuring upgrades. Enhancements tend to happen more quickly and in shorter development cycles and often occur based on customer requests. However, a downside for some companies is they fear they would lose the flexibility that the on-premise software model provides. With cloud computing apps, the development of upgrades or new features it is often up to the vendor. You may lose some deeper functional tools you get with a desktop app. In some cases, such as online retailing, you want a cloud computing application because it changes with the marketplace. If your need involves some sort of integration, then cloud computing might be for you. Many of todays cloud based apps offer an API (application programming interface) that other synergistic apps will leverage. For example, you might find an accounting package that ties into a CRM package. If you wanted to do this with you current desktop application, you would have to pay someone to customize both apps for you. A web-based app might have already done it for you and it would save you both time and money. If integration is a concern, you can look at an offering like CastIron (recently acquired by IBM) that pre-configures a number of apps so that you can connect to the solutions you are already using. When it comes to cloud computing and particularly app integration, the highlighted that 26 percent of small businesses have heard about cloud computing from their channels, while only 13 percent have heard about it from an IT company. So, as you contemplate customization with your existing apps, youll want to make sure your IT provider knows the ins and outs of cloud computing integration. GetApp.com matches business buyers with cloud computing software providers. They currently have over 2,200 applications across over 300 categories in their business app store and you can drill down by different needs and functions to help you find the right app or set of apps. GetApp.com offers free services to small businesses for finding and comparing business applications delivered as on-premises Software, SaaS, Virtual Appliance and Cloud Computing. How quickly do you need a solution? Do you need something right now? If rapid deployment is integral to your project, cloud computing offers a definite advantage. Many cloud computing products are up in running in hours, if not minutes. You may not get every feature set configured to your need, but you can often start working right out of the gate. If the provider you evaluate has an API (application programming interface) connected to another application you need, then it may offer solid advantages over a desktop application youll need to pay more to customize later. For example, many small business owners will use a web-based ecommerce solution like BigCommerce (one of the market leaders with over 8,000 customers) or one of the 48 other shopping carts we listed in this post: . Traditional and larger software purchases usually start with a request for proposal (RFPs), design, development, testing and negotiations. All that can take months. With most cloud computing systems, the customer can generally see the application working during the trial period, and return on investment (ROI) happens more quickly. If cash-flow is an issue, cloud computing applications may be a perfect option. On-premise software purchases often involve high upfront licensing costs. With cloud computing apps, there are usually no large up-front licensing fees requiring departmental or board approval. Most of the time, there are no annual maintenance fees, either. SaaS pricing is often transparent and clear on a website pricing page. Generally, if a cloud computing app vendor does not reveal its pricing or requires a demo, it means it is a more complicated solution that demands some installation process or customization that will cost you more upfront. Again, that is a generalization, but what we often see when do product reviews. Cloud computing applications are not always cheaper than on-premise desktop software. it can be true that cloud computing solutions are less expensive during the first two years, but may not be for a five-year total cost of ownership (TCO). With no initial large investment into cloud based applications, that makes sense. They suggest that you should expect to see your TCO rising in the third year and beyond. So, again, as we mentioned above, it is going to depend on the exact pricing of the cloud based apps youre considering, how many users, and so forth and then compared to a similar number of licenses for desktop software. When an application package requires an upgrade, users are often faced with two options: Upgrade at a high cost and experience delays as the new features are evaluated and plans for adoption are formulated. Hire or enlists local IT talent to develop, test, debug, deploy and train personnel on the new application. Continue using the older version of the software and avoid any advantages that an upgraded version might bring. We want to be careful not to paint a picture of cloud computing applications being completely superior to a desktop application as that isnt the case. It just offers another way to solve your software challenges. In both cases, you are waiting for software changes to be made by the software company, but in the cloud computing model you typically see those upgrades faster than with a desktop application. The vendor applies upgrades at the data center. The upgrades are made available to users immediately via online connection and there are only minor delays. The upgrades also come at no cost to the user. This is important to emphasize: Your monthly fee covers the upgrades, so when you compare pricing you need to consider this. If you upgrade every year, then the monthly outlay may be lower from a total cost perspective over time. With a desktop application, you are waiting until the next release, which often only occurs annually. Cloud based applications can be less robust by nature of their focus on a particular area or business niche. For example, Shoebox doesbookkeeping only. Some pundits argue that you have to operate your business, from a software perspective, using the Pareto Principle (80 per cent of the effects come from 20 per cent of the solution), however, this is not entirely accurate. Most desktop users routinely state that they do not use all of the features of a desktop application. This is part of how many cloud based applications get developed; taking aim at the core problems that users face instead of offering an overwhelming feature set that most users will never even try. Even if the cloud computing application does not have every feature you need, you often can add it via customization or premium levels of vendor service. Most well-designed cloud computing systems offer extensive interface capability, usually via Web services that integrate both internal and hosted systems. Each application provider is different, of course, and your specialized functions may not be available even with integration and configuration. It is a myth that cloud computing software doesnt play well with legacy applications/data sources. There are two primary methods of integrating cloud computing apps. The first method is batch synchronization, which initially involves exporting/importing your data into a cloud based application. Once this initial data load has been made, data can be incrementally synchronized on a scheduled basis. The second method is real-time integration via Web services, which is like a neutral middle layer where your application talks to the cloud computing company. Now that weve debunked the myth that cloud computing software model is only okay for simple implementations, lets point out that you have to evaluate the implications and limitations of cloud computing software for your needs. Some gaps remain for complex, end-to-end processes that require complicated workflows or business processes. All of this section on goals leads us to scalability: Will your cloud computing vendor allow for future organizational evolution and code customizations? For many reasons, you should keep your lead technical people in the loop for security and integration issues. If youre a business user, and not sure about what information youre sharing, you could be sending information out the door that onsite applications need or you could be putting corporate information at risk. One of the challenges with cloud computing is that applications and services are now easily accessible to business end-users, who can acquire these Software-as-a-Service capabilities without input from their IT or data management teams. Cloud integrations can be complicated by other, related problems, such as data replication, outages and the hassles of outsourced data storage. If youre tech team doesnt know you are running certain cloud based apps, you could create a challenge in more than one functional area. Good cloud computing companies have built their apps on a Web-services based architecture. Its less proprietary, and as such its easier for these apps to share data with one another. Sometimes these standards could inadvertently create security problems. While these standards make it easier for companies to integrate services, it also could give the keys to the kingdom away to hackers if the proper security is not in place. Cloud computing applications are often easier to use and require less user training. Most SaaS vendors provide online video tutorials as well as robust user communities and forums where you can get answers to your challenges. Users often get direct access to these teams and it can reduce the burden on your own internal teams. Cloud computing is one of the important trends shaping technology for the small business market today and likely for decades to come. Overall, if youre trying to grow your company and are limited by finances, cloud computing brings down-to-earth benefits for most. Add mobile computing to the mix via Smartphones and other mobile technologies like the iPad and you see where installed, on-premise applications have a shrinking audience. Consider the story about how the theft of a 8 computers only stopped one small company for a matter of hours while they hooked up new computers and then connected to the web. In this guide, we suggested 16 things you need to consider before choosing cloud computing solutions. Youll find most cloud computing apps give you a new perspective on how you get work done, how you solve problems. Cloud computing gives you and your team flexibility in location, at a cash-flow level, and in how and what we call software. The term cloud computing might still be buzz-worthy and talked about like that flashy sports car on a used car lot, but the reality is theres a super-powered engine under the hood most of the time and youll be sold from that test drive all the way to ownership. Cloud Computing Cost Estimator Cloud Computing The Evolution of SaaS","If youre putting all your focus on the holiday sales season, youre neglecting a huge opportunity  the chance to boost your retail sales after the new year, which is typically a slower time of the year for many. Plenty of peoplewill be heading into stores in January to exchange unwanted items, cash in gift cards or spend giftedmoney. With the right approach and some advance planning, you can continue to capture their attention, and their dollars, well into the new year. Personally, Im a sucker for Kohls cash. The national chain periodically rewards shoppers with $10 to spend for every $50 in purchases. The catch: Kohls cash can only be spent during a certain window of time. Since it feels like free money, I almost always end up checking out the store before my Kohls cash expires and spending a lot more than I received in free money. You can reward customers with store cash, gift cards or percentage/dollar-off deals. Whatever you choose, the key is to focus on getting your customers back into your store in January, a frequently slow sales month. Gift cards were the number one most popular gift last year. So if your store sells them, you have built-in sales in January (and even later). Even if customers never redeem their cards, youve gotten paid for the face value. But if you can get them to come into your store in January, all the better, since theyll usually spend more than the amount of the card. Make sure you capture email addresses from people who shop at your store over the next four weeks. If you do that, you can then reach out again in January with an email marketing message. You can do a soft sell with a digital Happy New Year eCard and a gentle reminder to come in and take advantage ofyear-end clearance items, or sweeten the pot with a discount offer. Januaryis the perfect time to get rid of slow-moving items that didnt sell well. Discount them to rock-bottom prices to get people into your store. And then entice those customers with well-merchandised displays for full-priced items. Consumers are likely to feel a letdown as they head back to work and open their credit card statements that reflecthigh balances from all of their recentspending. Put them back in a goodmood with fun contests, giveaways or challenges. Give away a free gift with purchases. Hold a drawing in the store for a prize such as a $100 gift card or a desirable product. Or have customers bring in the biggest white elephant gift they got this yearto receivea $10 gift card in exchange. The new year is a time when people are ready for change. Try marketing that emphasizes how your business can help them usher in the new. Whether its by purchasing snazzy new workout wear from your boutique to motivate a fitness regimen, overhauling the home entertainment center with surround sound speakers from your electronics store, or redecorating the living room for spring, there are plenty of ways to get customers energized about new projects  and into your store to get those projects going. What ideas will you use to boost your retail sales in January?","The Director, Interactive Marketing, is responsible for developing and placing non-paid promotional and editorial content in support of New Lines theatrical releases, in order to ensure the broadest possible exposure within a films target audience.","If your business depends upon online traffic, you should know. More than half of digital traffic online now comes from mobile devices and through mobile apps. A says smartphones and tablets combined now account for 6o percent of all online traffic up from 50 percent a year ago. And 51 percent of that traffic is driven by mobile apps (like those for digital radio such as Pandora or Spotify, digital messaging like WhatsApp or Viber and social apps like Facebook and Twitter.) Significantly, this is a very different measure than , as cited in another recent report from SEO platform BrightEdge. That study suggested that about 23 percent of organic traffic to websites now originates from Android or iPhone devices while 12 percent comes from tablets. But this report looked only at traffic originating from mobile search, in other words, someone looking for something using a search engine like Google or Bing via their phone or tablet. The comScore report examines a much broader cross section of online traffic. It could just as easily be looking at visitors delivered to your website via a link on a Facebook app as from a mobile search for your business on a search engine. One conclusion is that, while categories like digital radio and photo sites like Instagram and Flickr may draw more activity, for marketers (and small businesses) social media is most important. In its official report, comScore explains: The report adds that: The report should give you a whole new perspective on the importance of social media marketing for your business, especially on sites like Facebook.","LinkedIn continues what is turning into a string of purchases with the announcement it will acquireB2B marketing company for a cool $175 million.

One of the larger headlines revolved around their new effort to to help Google compete with Bings Twitter deal and, of course, Twitter itself.  With real-time search, Google would be pulling live updates from news, blogs, Yahoo Answers, Twitter, etc, and placing them in the results as a live stream to tell you whats happening right now. Google put together a video to illustrate . In theory, the idea of inserting live feeds in the search results is pretty neat. Im sure Google anticipated it as a good thing. An exciting thing. However, yesterday , my partner at Outspoken Media, underscored just how dangerous putting real-time results directly into the SERPs can be  claiming it opened the door to . I recommend reading Raes post to get a full understanding of how Googles current implementation opens Pandoras Box to widespread spam and even dangerous behavior that may affect your children. However, I wanted to talk about it from a brand and reputation management perspective. If you were the type of business that was slow to monitor what people were saying about you, youre probably just got far worse. Imagine that tomorrow a customer has a bad experience with you. Frustrated, John Doe heads to Twitter and whips out a slew of libelous statements.  Then, a few hours later, someone does a search for your brand trying to locate your street address.  They first they see isnt your Web site or Google Local listing. Its the live stream of tweets telling the world that youre a liar and a crook.  Maybe it even shows other people joining in and doing the same.  Its throwing the conversation that took place on Twitter and putting right out into center court so that its impossible to miss.  Its no longer a blog entry that can be pushed down or a bad review that can be rectified.  Its gossip sitting at the top of your search results. As a business owner, what do you do to combat that? You need to learn to listen faster.  That means using tools like , , and to monitor the conversation in real-time instead of simply watching it week by week.  It also means getting more involved with your community to ward off these types of attacks. Were only a few days into Googles real-time search endeavor so its my hope that theyre going find a way to perfect the very sloppy system theyve unleashed to the masses. As it stands, its simply dangerous. Dangerous to business owners, to searchers, and even to parents who all just lost control of whats streaming through their search results.","I know what youre thinking. The phrase Facebook applications makes you break out into a Farmville-induced sweat, but not all Facebook applications were created in a sea of vapid. Some have real business uses and can help small business owners increase their Facebook marketing opportunities. Dont believe me?  Below are a few of my favorite business-oriented Facebook applications that can assist your business with better branding, better promotion and even better customer intel. I mentioned this application a few months back in my post; however, I dont think its marketing power can be stressed enough.   What the Static FBML application does is allow you to create a custom landing page for your visitors to land on.  This way instead of having users land on a page that looks and feels like Yet Another Boring Fan Page, you can shape their experience to make it one that engages and sells. The Static FBML application can be a little tricky to set up, so I recommend you read Jesse Stays .  He does such a great job breaking it down that even I could do it after that lesson. If you download and use one application on your Facebook fan page, make it this one. We often talk about how important it is for users to be engaging with your updates.  This simple act ensures that your fans are actually and that theyre not winding up in the unread abyss.  Polls are one way that many small business owners try to build engagement and get users to share their content. Well, thats where the Facebook Poll app comes in.  This application takes the informal polls that SMBs sometimes create in their normal status updates and makes it a whole lot more official.   The Poll app is really easy to use and set up, and simply requires that you provide it with a question, some possible answers, and set if the results are public or private.  Because you can set the responses to be private, its also a good way to get feedback about recent product launches or other issues.  The uses for this one are pretty much endless. Promotions for Fan Pages is another popular and powerful Facebook application that small business owners should be aware of.  This application helps SMBs to create and publish branded contests, coupons, sweepstakes or giveaways to get more attention and to give users another reason to interact with the page.  To get started, youll need to create a free account via . Once youre set up, SMBs can build marketing promotions by specifying the types of prizes up for grabs, requirements for entry, contest dates and other details.  Because so many small business owners naturally use things like coupons and giveaways in their marketing efforts, I really like this one.  It helps increase exposure to the promotion youre running and also gives fans something exciting to engage with. NetworkedBlogs is one of the many applications available to help small business owners share and promote blog content. The reason I prefer this app over something like (which is great for simply pulling in RSS feeds) is because its a lot more community-oriented. To get started with NetworkedBlogs, youll first have to download the application and then verify (a) that you own your blog and (b) that you authorize NetworkedBlogs to pull this information onto your page. The process is painless and shouldnt take more than a few minutes. Once youve confirmed your status, youll be able to add your blog to the NetworkedBlogs directory, optimizing your blog name, tag lines, associated tags, description, etc.   Not only will the application pull your content onto your Fan page via a new Blog tab, but it will also allow others to find you in the NetworkedBlogs directory when they do a search for blogs on your topics. Thats where I think this application beats out many of the other RSS syndication apps. In the spirit of aggregating content, the YouTube for Pages apps allows small business owners to easily pull their YouTube videos for display directly on their Facebook Fan page. Yep, thats right, no more multiple uploads.  Downloading the application will add a new Tab to your Fan page and give fans direct access to your most recent or favorite YouTube videos.  It also gives you another reason why you should be experimenting with online video. Storefront Social is interesting in that it allows you to link your e-commerce Web site with your Facebook page so that users can view your merchandise directly from Facebook.  Combine this with a service like and you start to see how social media will soon house real transactions built on real relationships.  The process of uploading your products is relatively painless and simply requires importing a CSV file or uploading manually.  The one small catch is that its not free. The app comes with a few different price points (starting with $4.95/month for 36 item uploads), but I think the value more than outweighs the small fee for the provided. Those are some of my favorite Facebook applications that dont involved tending to a farm or feeding virtual animals. What business-oriented applications are you currently using?","Your customers are looking for you. Can they find you? When potential customers have a problem and need somewhere to go, they search for it. They head to their favorite search engine, type what they want and are presented with a list of results Google promises can help them. If you dont appear in those results, you dont exist.   You miss out on the sale, the branding opportunity and the ability to convert that targeted searcher into a lifelong customer.   And thats the value that search engine optimization (SEO) brings to small businesses. It puts you in your customers line of sight and establishes you as an expert. A lot of small businesses dont fully understand SEO.  They think its dirty, that SEOs are , that its out of their budget, or that its something they dont need to worry about because theyre not a major brand.  The truth is, the Internet has changed the face of business and leveled the playing field for everyone. By investing in SEO, you allow your company to show up for those targeted local searches, while also putting yourself in the position to compete with the big dogs. Heres what a lot of small businesses dont realize about SEO. :  Whether youre doing it yourself or paying someone to help you, SEO doesnt have to break your budget. Most of your attention will go towards ensuring that your site is set up correctly, that youre listed in all the appropriate local indexes (which is free and something you can do on your own), and helping to target your site for very specific, locally-based terms.  For most businesses, youre going to find that this process probably isnt anywhere near as expensive or difficult as youd imagine.  Its also one of the most cost-effective marketing strategies out there as youll continue to benefit from good optimization for years to come. Quite simply, a site that is properly constructed will rank better than a site that is not. And you dont have to drain your budget in order to pay attention to fundamental SEO. :  Small businesses have a huge leg up over larger brands when it comes to their SEO and marketing campaigns. Unlike them, have a license to be creative. You can take more chances, try things faster and engage easier.  Use all of this to your advantage. Launch that Twitter campaign now, experiment with on-page SEO strategies, test different Title tags to see which convert better, do interesting things for links and to create buzz, etc.  One of the great advantages to being a small business is that theres no legal or PR red tape to step though. It makes you more agile and gives you a lot more freedom to do great things and to quickly test what works and what works even better. : You will make back what you invest in SEO.  If you can get your local business to show up in Googles 10-pack, youre going to greatly increase the exposure, branding and profitability of your Web site.  All of the little things that go into local SEO are designed to attract people who are naturally looking for you, to let them know you exist and to make it easy for them to find you.  Launching a Web site without worrying about the fundamentals of SEO is like writing a great novel only to hide it on a shelf in your basement.  Theres no sense being great if no one knows it. Search engine optimization puts your Web site in front of your customer base. Theres no black magic here. The core of SEO is simply creating great Web sites. Its about making them content-rich and useful for searchers, while also taking the time to make them accessible and easy to understand to the search engines. Thats the goal of being on the Web and SEO helps you accomplish that. It ensures that your Web site is set up correctly from the very beginning so that its naturally a hit to both users and the search engines. Its about make usable sites. And thats something absolutely every business can benefit from. : More and more small businesses are realizing the impact search engine optimization can have on the success of their company.  And theyre investing in it.  The longer you wait to make that same investment, the harder its going to be for you to match their efforts and stay ahead of the pack.  When someone in your area heads to Google because a pipe just burst in their home and its now flooding with water, theyre going to grab the name of that plumber listed first in Google Local. Theyre going to perform a second search or waste time weighing their options. They have a flood and you need to be there immediately. SEO is no longer something businesses can ignore, regardless of their size.  If youre thinking of finally dipping your toe into the SEO waters, make sure you check out Janet Meiners Thaelers recent post on or Lee Oddens post on .  Both are filled with great information.","Programming aint easy. Whats harder is to convey concepts into printed words. Books can sometimes lag behind the latest-and-greatest moments in a given technology, overlooking the heart of decisions and choices behind the code. Fortunately some writers get their message to the heart quickly. One who I think got it is Eric Elliott, author of . Elliott is a JavaScript application development veteran. He is currently a member of the Creative Cloud team at Adobe. Im usually searching for open source development tools and developer meetups, so I was lucky that I discovered a early release via OReilly  special thanks to Revolunet, a French web developer that has collected a great reading library for web developers. A brief technical history is in order: JavaScript is a client-side programming language, meant to operate website functions without having the browser contact a server in the process. Originally those functions were limited to those infamous pop up windows youd see when arriving at a website  harmful or beneficial depending on the pop up content. Today JavaScript is providing real value, as Elliott highlights the watershed moments that lead to todays internet experience. Such moments also influenced analytics  most analytics rely on Javascript tags, event tracking and regular expressions to measure site performance, so Elliott espouses on the right touchstones. I call Javascript the other white meat because of its growing prowess as a programming choice among a multitude of programming choices. More than a history, the book offers itself as a cookbook of sorts for objects and functions. Programming can be analogous to cooking, so to be a good chef in the digital kitchen a cookbook should give clear instructions. In this case, Elliott explains advanced JavaScript in context of the Internet. Diagrams that show how programming works with Internet infrastructure will help managers plan activities and a supporting budget to implement. The handiness of the acronyms  like, DRY, which means Dont Repeat Yourself  helps to refine functions for developers. They can also lend ideas for how to approach elements in a project that have to be coded. Take this example for DOT  Do One Thing: Steps associated with advanced material get covered pretty well, such as Callbacks, functions that you pass as arguments to be invoked when the callee has finished its job. This material may be a bit much for those who dont program, but I didnt find it incredibly overwhelming to managers who have heard of programming languages but have never used an editor. For those who fear code, fear not. Elliot offers some great suggestions on starter material, as well as additional links for new libraries. is meant for programmers, without question. I have no doubt developers will have a better formation of an app. Moreover, its worth a browse for the tech-curious business owner. It can explain some details to make app development easier, and save small business owners some headaches and training costs in understanding some of the programming issues encountered.","Your profile needs to instantly grab the viewers attention. More importantly, it needs to encourage them to action: To explore more, connect, or reach out for another reason. A profile must be professional, but the best ones are interesting and sometimes fun.

For one thing, you can say that books provide food for thought.  Sometimes the book  is the intellectual equivalent of Steak au Poivre served at a high-end gourmet restaurant and sometimes its the warm comfort of a greasy burger and fries from your local dive. Today, Im getting down and dirty with not one, but two books of the greasy burger variety.  This is a super-two-fer book reviewyoure just not going to be able to resist! I bought these two books together for two reasons.  The first is to use them in tandem.  I wanted to combine the insight into the affluent demographic that Kennedy offers with the practical and adaptable strategies that Glazer offers in my marketing strategies. The other reason was that I was bored and tired of the over-engineered, over-strategized and over-produced pabulum that passes for marketing and doesnt work.  In short, I wanted down and dirty, in-your-face marketing ideas that would comfort me and my craving for unpretentious low-budget marketing systems and strategy. The    book was born about five years ago when Dan Kennedy  started looking into the affluent population.  What he found will surprise you. His research showed that an overwhelming majority of the affluent actually worked their way up from nothing.  And its this set of life history and circumstances that feeds their emotional purchasing triggers. Here is just a taste: Everybodys buying behavior is driven by emotions, justified as necessary, after the fact, with logic. He then gives a list of generic  E-factors (emotional factors) that effect everyone such as  Fear, Pride, Love, Guilt, Greed.  He goes on to say In addition to the E-Factors that affect everybody, the affluent have a particular set  some of which may surprise you: Insecurity; Fear of being found fakers; Desperate desire not to commit a faux pas;  Feeding emotional emptiness;  Giving themselves gold stars; and, After all, whats the point of being rich.  Developing offers that address these emotional needs and tweaking your marketing message to show this demographic how your offer addresses any of these, is a sure path to profits and great loyal clients. If youre running a small business such as a retail shop, real estate, doctors office, financial planning  or legal practice, this book is a NO BRAINER choice for you right now.  If youre a B2B company, dont make the mistake of thinking this book isnt for you.  Remember, make buying decisions, .  Take the time to play with the ideas he offers and see how you can adapt them to your business. If Dan Kennedys book whets your appetite for attracting an underserved market segment, then Bill Glazers book   will give you all the examples, ideas and formats of advertising and direct marketing programs that actually worked.

The word suggests knowing something before tacking action. And in business, appropriate decisions are needed to be successful. If youre in business and seeking perspective on how to build a business properly, reading the book by Chris Rabb is very appropriate. Even Rabbs background is appropriate, for this books theme. Currently on assignment at Temple University, Rabb is a writer, consultant, and speaker on numerous topics related to entrepreneurship, media, civic engagement, and social identity. Hes been highlighted on programs such MSNBCs Up with Chris Hayes. Note: You can watch the program featuring Rabb alongside JJ Ramberg at the end of this review (also read Ivana Taylors great review of JJs book ). Rabbs management of entrepreneurial programs for a business assistance program in an underserved neighborhood, along with research from sources such as the Kauffman Firm Survey and the Panel on the Study of Entrepreneurial Development (PSED), forged his examination of the resources that make or break business success. I spoke with the author via phone after a friends Facebook connection, and I connected with the values he presents whether on news programs or in print: Entrepreneurs must constantly assess their regular connections and how those connections are deployed as capital necessary to success. If you followed the controversy about President Barrack Obamas You Didnt Do It comment regarding business owners, youll appreciate what this book sets out to explain. Written well before the debate, the book notes that many concepts of entrepreneurship are overemphasized. Rabb feels that the U.S. is facing entrepreneurial illiteracya lack of meaningful insight among ordinary people becoming entrepreneurs as well as the leaders who promote entrepreneurship Invisible capital is defined as a set of tactical assets that works for a given organization. The book details those assets, the: Rabb reviews these influences, highlighted by data and studies. Chapter 2 gives a brief overview of the composition and performance of U.S. businesses. Chapters 3 and 4 connects and contrasts how invisible capital operates with American societys appreciation for  . For example, the way minority and women owned businesses are defined by federal programs can blur how invisible capital access remains lopsided for many of these businesses. Rabbs belief to inventory what you already have, and to learn what you need manifests in the solutions and support suggested in Chapters 5 and 6. Rabb makes clear that policies should discern beneficial economic development from simple adoption of individual beliefs that do not leverage resources and encourages the entrepreneurial illiteracy about developing resources. Rabb supports Druckers differentiation of an entrepreneur vs small business, and from there the text expands the thesis. For example, Rabb shows a figure that notes the diminishing chances of a U.S. start up existing 10 years and achieving over $100,000 net per year: Now this sounds like a fall-of-the-American-way-of-life tone, but Rabbs true belief in a persons capability in acquiring invisible capital balances that tone. The capacity to collectively make better choices about our capital is achievable, and Rabb speaks loud and clear to that objective: Answers for each economic segment are not detailed, but Invisible Capital does enlighten many books in which detailed solutions are presented, such as that in David Gladstones . The ideas about capital combined with the historical aspects makes the investment questions raised in Gladstones book more poignant. Reading will challenge you to examine your own resources more critically and appreciate the appropriate steps to build resources for success. Below is an MSNBC segment of the show Up with Chris Hayes which features JJ Ramberg and Chris Rabb. Check it out:","We didnt set out to become entrepreneurs. We simply noticed a gap in the market, addressed a category we were , and chose to fill the gap ourselves. The entrepreneurial bit was simply an outcome of a desire to bring back the art of the handwritten note and provide good quality stationery to like-minded patrons in India, says Sanaa Jhurani, Co-founder of The Papier Project. Sanaa, and her partner in crime Ayesha Wadhawan, founded the Mumbai-based stationery startup because the self-confessed stationery addicts couldnt find what they were looking for in the city. One thing led to another and we decided that if there was anyone who could bring this stationery enterprise to India, it was us, says Sanaa. Ayesha and Sanaa met at their previous place of work, Heel&Buckle, and it all pretty much took off from there. Ayesha handled e-commerce while Sanaa handled PR and marketing. We were, as they say, a in heaven. Colleagues to lunch partners to best friends, and now business partners, writes Sanaa. Ayesha and Sanaa envision The Papier Project to grow into a serious stationery enterprise that is easy to access  one that has a young, vibrant, and internationally influenced design aesthetic. Papier means paper in French. Sanaa explains, Theres a certain romantic sensibility associated with a charming Parisian afternoon, an indescribable emotive response that has you going weak in the knees with the wistful charm of a bygone era that was dotted with letters of love, post cards from fondly remembered holidays, the yellowed pages of a favourite novel, or even a fading photograph. The Papier Project was founded as an ode to this emotive response, an ode that was meant to encapsulate the beauty of the written word and the sheer magic of being able to pen down our thoughts, of the possibility of creating and leaving a legacy, an imprint  one that stands the test of time and serves as tactile proof of our feelings. Sanaa and Ayesha designed the offerings of The Papier Project to be an amalgamation of the bold novelty of modern contemporary design and the traditional simplicity of classic styles. The two ladies are avid travellers and their visual philosophies are almost entirely influenced by their travels abroad. Sanaa says, If we arent travelling ourselves, our voracious appetite for reading, a vast majority of which is satiated by romance novels, is inspiration enough to ensure that we are constantly bringing something new to the design board. A lot of our design work is a reflection of our personalities, our personal preferences and our individual interpretations of the myriad influences we encounter in our daily lives. Most of our customers see the design, but only we see each piece of art as a tiny bit of our soul. The Papier Project employs a three-pronged approach. One arm of the business is our manufacturing and designing wing  where we produce a whole range of products under The Papier Project label. These products are then retailed through our own e-commerce portal, through our retail store at the new domestic terminal at T2 Chhatrapti Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, and through other third-party portals. The other arm of the business is our customisation studio where we work with clients to create complete custom stationery solutions to complement their requirements. Most of the clients we meet typically look for these custom sets to gift to newly married couples or specific sets for their children. Finally, the third arm of our business model is associated with an endeavour to promote our portal as a one-stop-shop for all things stationery. We are moving towards an aggregators model, where we will host other stationery brands alongside our own homegrown label, so that a client can essentially be presented with the opportunity to peruse all the various options at their disposal by visiting our portal, Sanaa offers. Founded in 2015, The Papier Project is a bootstrapped venture that is hoping to break even through ambitious offerings in its immediate future. We're looking to expand into multiple physical retail and product variants. We want to make The Papier Project more available to our customers and also host other budding indie brands that match our design aesthetic. Eventually, the goal is that when a customer thinks of good-quality stationery they immediately think The Papier Project, says Sanaa. They havent put a number on the customer base, but say the response has been favourable. In the initial few weeks after our launch, a lot of the sales that came in were primarily from friends and family or personal referrals. The first time a complete stranger took a gamble on us  and kept coming back to us for more  we knew we were doing something right, Sanaa exclaims. The biggest landmark was a complete surprise for them. She explains, We had customised a wedding planner with the name Bipasha  and a few days later we read about it in the news  which is when we realised that this was for Bipasha Basu! The Papier Project is on a three-year timeline to break even and so far, Sanaa confirms, they are on schedule. The Papier Projects bestselling product is their range of greeting cards. Sanaa is not surprised. She says, We firmly believed that sterile texts/WhatsApp messages/emails simply could not match up to something so beautiful. Sanaa is the first to admit they didnt have a clue as to what they were doing when starting up. While creating beautiful was their forte, backing up that dream with technical knowledge and analytical foundation has been hard on the duo. She says, Rewinding a few months, a lot of these challenges were frighteningly daunting. When it came to setting up our website, the back-end system that wed operate on, designing our customer interface, ensuring easy navigation, and the myriad technical details that needed to be addressed, we found ourselves in over our heads. We had to blindly rely on the expertise of another team of people and trust the fact that theyd deal with this as thoroughly and as succinctly as we would have ourselves. Its hard to just trust someone and go in blindly, especially when you have so much riding on the outcome of this decision, and you have no concrete parameter to help make this judgement. Since then, the two have relied on their past mistakes to make better decisions about the future. And while these challenges have become less fearsome with time, others are not so easily vanquished. A major struggle continuing to plague our operations is the need to find good-quality vendors, who are as committed to running a sustainable enterprise that minimises wastage without compromising on the quality of the finished product, Sanaa rues. Sanaa recently experienced a celebrity moment. Just the other day I was at a friends wedding function and a random stranger came up to me and asked me if I was The Papier Project. To be recognised and referred to as our dream is a milestone moment that we arent going to forget anytime soon. I had to come back and tell Ayesha that it really isnt in our heads, there are actual people who follow our work, and there are patrons who are joining our movement to speak through paper. In that one moment, everything became real. While Sanaa admits that there are plenty of people in her and Aayeshas lives who believe in them and have faith that The Papier Project is going to be a success, its the naysayers who have done them a special favour. The best advice weve ever received? Sana says. To quit. Very early in our journey, when we were still struggling to find our feet, we had a very dear family member tell us that this idea was destined for failure. They believed, like a number of other people, that in an age that is dominated by the advent of technology, a venture such as ours will struggle to meet patrons who feel as strongly for the cause. Nothing can motivate me more than someone telling me that Im going to fail. Their lack of belief in our dream and in our abilities to make this work was all that we needed to make sure we did everything in our power to prove them wrong. I sure hope were a lot closer to doing that today than we were back then. Sanaas own advice to her fellow dreamers is far less cynical. She says, Dont overthink it. As soon as you manage to zero in on what youd like to do, jump in with all that youve got and dont look back. Once youre in it, you dont have a choice but to give it your all and to do everything that it takes to make it work. Believe in the magic of new beginnings and have faith in your abilities to make it work.","What business trends are on the foreseeable horizon heading into the new year? Lets jump in and explore what I feel are the top three listed below. A couple years ago this was #1. For a variety of reasons, however, the shine of social media has lost a bit of its luster. This past year both Forbes and USAToday reported how social media isnt working for small businesses in pieces titled, Why Small Businesses Are Losing On Social Mediaand Study: Social Media a Bust for Small Businesses. Both were in response to a research revealing that over 60% of small businesses reported they dont see any ROI (return on investment) on their social-media activities. Thats a big number and a strong indication that while many may have been partying with social media these past couple years, a lot of those folks are now feeling a hangover. It seems that the people making the most measurable money on social media are the folks charging you to tell you how to do it. That said, social media certainly isnt going away and it will continue to be an important element of a business marketing plan. In 2014, it just wont have the lure its had in past few years. While everyone has a cell phone, not everyone has a smart phone. And, certainly, not everyone has a tablet. But in 2014 more people will have both. Which is why more businesses will be conforming to a mobile market in 2014. Its also the reason web designers are experiencing their biggest spike in business since 1997. Its called which means that the site design will look as good on a mobile device as it does on a desktop or laptop. At this point, most dont. In 2014, theyd better.Also, more and more business is being done remotely and virtually requiring more and better mobile devices. Lastly, mobile towers are expanding and networks are getting better and faster every day. Youd think that something thats been around forever would be fading away. The opposite has happened with video. There are multiple reasons for this, The continuing serge in video-friendly mobile devises, the fact the Google has made video much more search friendly, and the simple fact that video is the most engaging of all media. has spawned new monikers like  . That term didnt even exist a couple years ago and its now one of the fastest growing searches on Google. Youve heard the saying, You can never be too thin or too rich. For 2014, add, or have too much video.","For the new business that is just starting out, a common question is, When is the right time to file a trademark application? Should business owners bother registering before their product or service is ready, or just wait until theyre ready to officially launch to the marketplace? In the U.S., a business gets common law rights to a name as soon as it is used in commerce. That means that as soon as you start selling a product or service, you can claim common law ownership of that trademark without formally registering it with the . However, these common law rights are limited to the particular geographic location where the mark is used, and will offer limited help in court should you want to challenge someones use of the same or similar name. As a result, its typically best for a business to lock up their trademark rights for their company name as soon as possible. In many cases, a business will want to start the trademark application as soon as their LLC or corporation paperwork is filed. By filing for a trademark prior to launch, you can be sure that your name is protected once you begin commercial sales. However, there may be an even stronger reason to apply early. Your application for a trademark is typically accompanied by a comprehensive trademark and name search. This means that you will search the USPTO database, as well as local and state databases, to ensure that your proposed name isnt already in use by somebody else in a similar industry/field. When you apply to be an LLC/corporation, the state will verify that your name is available within that state, but it doesnt check to see whats happening in the other 49 states. Unless you perform a comprehensive trademark search, you run the risk of accidentally infringing on someone elses name. If that happens, you can be ordered to stop using your name immediately, and all the hard work you put in to building your brand name in the market will fly out the window. While its advisable to apply for a trademark as soon as possible, there is one catch. Having a trademark implies that your product or service is market-ready and the trademarked name is being used in interstate commerce (i.e. selling in more than one state). But what happens when youre not quite ready for market yet? In this case, the USPTO lets you file an , which is exactlyas it sounds. . .you plan on using the name in commerce in the near future. Once the USPTO approves your intent-to-use application, you must start using the name in commerce within six months. Keep in mind it should take at least several months for the USPTO to process and approve your application. If you are still not ready six months after approval, you can file for an extension. Then, you are allowed up to four additional six-month extensions. For each extension request, the USPTO wants to see good cause as to why your name has not yet been used in commerce. The main advantage of filing an intent-to-use application is that your filing date will serve as the date of the first use, even if your product/service isnt in the market yet. Your first-date use can be very important down the road in the event theres a conflict with another business name. In order for your intent-to-use filing to be successful, you must continue to request extensions on time, and ultimately use the name in commerce (start selling your product and service). If you fail to use the name or request an extension, the USPTO will deem your application to be abandoned and cancel your application altogether. This means you will need to start the application process all over again, including paying the application fees a second time. Your business brand is its livelihood. Do all that you can to protect yours by applying for trademark protection (either full trademark or intent-to-use) as soon as possible. This ensures that you are not putting yourself at significant legal risk by using someone elses name, in addition to being the most effective way to protect your own brand and name.","The has put companies in a difficult position regarding the use of criminal background checks to screen job applicants. This is because companies are obligated to screen out criminals, but now they face potential liability for doing just that. Here I will explain the reason for the conflict and how companies can best protect themselves. Criminal background checks are used by 70 to 80% of companies according to the . Federal Judge Roger Titus recently noted that even the EEOC uses criminal background checks in its hiring process. Companies use criminal background checks for several reasons and listed below are the top three: 1) Most companies simply do not want to employ dangerous or dishonest people. 2) Companies can get sued for negligent hiring and retention if they employ a person with known criminal propensities. 3) Some companies are legally required to screen out criminals for certain positions. There is a risk that the blanket exclusion of convicted criminals in employment screening will have a discriminatory impact on minorities. Racial minorities have disproportionate conviction rates. For example, African Americans make up approximately 13% of the general population, but they account for 40% of the incarcerated population. The offers statistics and an explanation of the EEOCs enforcement guidance.The concern advanced by the EEOC and civil rights organizations is that a blanket exclusion of those with criminal records will exclude more minorities and create a risk of employment discrimination. The EEOC has launched an aggressive campaign against the use of criminal background checks. They sued a number companies, including BMW and Dollar General, over their use of criminal background checks. The EEOC charged these companies with discriminating against minorities for excluding all applicants with criminal records.  The EEOC contends that companies cannot exclude all applicants with a criminal records. To do so, they say, will discriminate against minorities. Instead, companies should assess each situation individually and determine if the applicants criminal record presents a genuine disqualification. A federal judge recently dismissed one of the EEOCs background check cases and sharply criticized the EEOC for filing the case. The court found that there was no evidence of employment discrimination.  The judge stated that the companiesuse of criminal background checks was reasonable and suitably tailored to its purpose of ensuring an honest workforce. The company in that case, , screened for convictions that had occurred in the last seven years and did not screen for arrests. The judge rejected the EEOCs argument that this screening process would adversely impact minorities. The Wall Street Journal offers . Now that the courts have rejected the EEOCs position on background checks, how should businesses use background checks to screen job applicants? The safest course of action is to follow the EEOCs rules because they may continue their enforcement efforts . Here is a summary of best practices: The best way to control risk is to reduce the number of background checks.  Do not run background checks on all applicants. Instead, make your employment offers conditional on passing a background check. This will dramatically reduce the number of background checks and avoid numerous other thorny issues as well (background checks often reveal other sensitive personal info that could create other grounds for suit). Only search for criminal convictions, not arrests. Arrests do not mean much so exclude them. Consider limiting convictions to 7 to 10 years. Conduct an individualized inquiry into each case to determine the nature of the crime and how it relates to the position. For example, if an applicant is applying to be a truck driver and he has driving related offenses, you can safely exclude that applicant. However, if the applicant has a 30 year old conviction for disturbing the peace, then that offense should be ignored because it does not relate to the applicants ability to drive a truck. Also, allow the applicant an opportunity to explain the situation. The point is to use the criminal background information in a reasonable individualized manner instead of a broad policy of systematic exclusion. It is essential to have a consistent policy in how criminal background checks are used. If people are treated differently, the company would be open to allegations of employment discrimination.  This puts employers in a conundrum because the EEOC wants companies to look at each criminal history finding on an individual basis. This makes it almost impossible to have a truly consistent policy because subjectivity will creep into the individualized inquiries. Companies will need to document each case and explain the basis for each decision. As long as a logical basis exists for each decision, the company should be able refute any allegations of discrimination if they arise. The EEOC is putting employers in a difficult situation with its aggressive enforcement efforts over criminal background checks. No perfect solution exists now. The EEOC should modify its position and issue clear realistic guidelines for companies. In the meantime, companies need to walk a fine line and keep accurate records to support each decision involving an applicants criminal history.","Lenovos A7000 phablet could spell the end of voice calls and video chats that leave you wondering.

Today, I want to point out some changes in angel deals and angel investments over the same period. Because there is a lot less information on angel investing than on venture capital, I will concentrate on just four dimensions of angel finance: The number of angel investors isnt appreciably different now from what it was before the Great Recession. The Center for Venture Research (CVR) at the University of New Hampshire (PDF) in 2007 and 268,160 in 2012. Thats a change of less than 4 percent. The amount of financing provided by business angels has changed by much more, declining 20 percent inflation-adjusted terms from before the recession to last year. According to CVRs estimates, angels invested $27.3 billion in 2007 versus $21.8 billion in 2012 (both measured in 2010 dollars). In contrast to the amount of money provided to entrepreneurs, which is now lower than before the start of the Great Recession, the number of companies receiving financing is currently substantially higher. The CVR estimates a 17.3 percent increase in the number of companies funded by angels between 2007 and 2012 (from 57,120 to 67,030). The decline in the amount of capital provided by angel investors combined with the increase in the number of companies that business angels have financed has led a sizable drop in the size of average angel investments. As the figure below shows, average angel investments were roughly one third lower last year than in 2007, when measured in real terms. Moreover, the relatively constant size of the average angel investment in the early part of the 2000s and again since 2008 suggests that the financial crisis and Great Recession has led angels to fundamentally alter the size of their investments. In short, angels have responded to the changed economic environment, not by exiting the market, but by providing less money to more startups, thereby dramatically reducing the size of the average angel investment.","Some choice jobs in digital media and mobile content posted this week: AT&T: Head of Broadband Content LOreal USA: Director, Interactive Marketing, New Business Gifts.com: Vice President of Software Engineering NBCU: Content Director, SciFi *Sony*Pictures Entertainment: Director, Mobile Production Lots more at our job board .","If your smartphone is stolen, it could give the thief access to important business and personal information. A new Minnesota smartphone anti-theft law will make it illegal to sell smartphones without some kind of security software either installed or capable of being downloaded. Police departments across the country have pushed for similar laws believing they will cut down on thefts. The number of smartphone thefts rose to 3.1 million last year, . Research from Creighton Universitys Heider College of Business the ability to wipe data from and deactivate stolen phones would save owners billions. But wireless carriers and smartphone makers pledge they are already moving to address the issue. In a voluntary agreement announced by The Wireless Association, a trade group representing the international telecommunications industry, leading companies : Carriers and phone makers pledged phone security would render a phone inoperable by unauthorized users. They also said it would prevent reactivation by anyone but the phones owner and could again be made operable if recovered by the owner. Companies signing on to the agreement, according to the association, were Apple, Asurion, AT&T, Google, HTC America, and Huawei Device USA. They also include LG Electronics MobileComm USA, Motorola Mobility LLC, Microsoft, Nokia, Samsung Telecommunications America, Sprint, T-Mobile USA, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless. The new smartphone anti-theft law and others being considered may be well-meaning and a good reminder to business owners in particular to take security precautions with mobile devices. But the legislation could also have another unintended consequence. It could make it difficult or impossible for small dealers and other resellers to keep offering used smartphones to their customers. The new legislation in Minnesota a long list of requirements for dealers. They include keeping detailed records with descriptions of each mobile device acquired; date, time and place each was acquired; name and drivers license number of the seller; and more. The smartphone anti-theft law also requires these records be kept for at least three years. The legislation includes requirements like the installation of video cameras or other imaging equipment at brick and mortar locations where used phones are being sold and a requirement that all phones bought by dealers be acquired through a check mailed to a specific address or electronic transfer.","You know the old saying: Cash is king. But with cash transactions in decline, Plastic is preferred would be a more accurate adage these days. In 2011, cash transactions made up 27 percent of point of sale purchases. By 2017, that number is expected to plunge to 23 percent. Credit card purchases, on the other hand, are expected to increase from 29 percent in 2011 to 33 percent of purchases by 2017. If your business doesnt already accept credit cards, chances are your customers are asking you to. According to a survey conducted byWePay, 58 percent of small businesses are regularly asked by their customers to accept credit cards. Customers increasingly expect to be able to pay with plastic, especially among the younger crowd. Sixty-nine percent of consumers between the ages of 18 and 34 will only shop at businesses that accept multiple forms of payment. Its not that hard to imagine a time in the not-so-distant future where saying cash is king will just show your age.

These can either be self-employed people, or those working with a small support staff. As for the position of architect, well, it sounds like an exciting career indeed. But, its way down the list at number 92, just above customer service rep and plumber. The field has suffered somewhat in overall earnings and demand since the building slump during the recession. The field is also highly stressful, U.S. News and World Report judges. Its not just demand and high salaries that caused some positions to be placed high on the list and others down near the bottom.

Following close behind were customer growth/loyalty (25 percent) and customer acquisition (19 percent). To give those numbers some street cred, eMarketer notes: Id definitely agree with the surveys that have found brand awareness is a leading reason for business owners to get involved in social media.  By constantly engaging in conversations, creating content, and starting conversations with potential customers, youre letting people know, time and time again, that you exist and youre listening. The effects over the long term are significant as customers start to associate your brand with a particular product or service. However, Id urge small business owners not to discount social medias effectiveness as a lead generation tool simply because lead generation got 19 percent of the vote from business owners.   You may remember that back in June we commented on a Unisfair survey that found social media to be the . The reason its numbers were so low in the July survey are likely because of the size of the budgets represented.  Customer acquisition is a bigger focus for small business owners than it is for those running midsized to large businesses, so they overshadowed the SMB perspective a bit in the more recent survey.  If youre a small business owner, however, customer acquisition is definitely an area where social media can give you a big boost. Ultimately, youll decide your own goals for your social media use and tailor your to fit whatever they are.  If youre focusing primarily on customer acquisition, youll be doing a lot more outreach than if youre simply trying to grow brand awareness and increase the visibility of your website.  Social media is a powerful tool that helps business owners connect with their audience and make their brand more accessible.   What you choose to focus on is up to you. What about you? Whats your main objective for entering the world of social media? What have your results been like?","These days, more and moresmall businesses and entrepreneurs arejumping on the cloud bandwagon.

If so, then you know that online ratings and reviews from customers are key to driving new customers to your business and growing your sales. The more reviews you have, the more trustworthy your business will appear to be. But too many small business owners arent doing all they can to encourage online reviews and get customers to post them. As a result, they have few or no reviews and get passed over in favor of businesses with more feedback. How can you encourage customers to leave reviews? Encourage is the key word here, because actively soliciting or requesting reviews is frowned on by review sites and providing incentives such as discounts or freebies in exchange for reviews can get you in trouble. Try these steps below instead Posting signage in your store, restaurant or office is a simple and subtle way to remind customers that your business is on review sites and that youd love a review. For example, Yelp has downloadable Find us on Yelp banners you can print out as signage for your store window or point-of-sale counter. Your store receipts or restaurant checks could say, Like us? Review us on [list the review sites where you have a presence]. An eCommerce company can send follow-up emails after the sale to make sure the customer was satisfied and include a reminder that your business is on review sites to further encourage online reviews. Put icons for the review sites where you have a presence in your print marketing materials, on your website (you can use the downloadable Yelp banners there), in your email signature and anywhere else you can think of. Everyones more inclined to write a review if its not a big hassle. So if your site says, Like us? Review us on Yelp, make sure theres a clickable link so they can do so in a minute. Whatever you do to encourage online reviews, theres one big dont. Dont fake them or have friends and family write them because youre worried you dont have enough.

And while the results are very helpful, the recommendations on these sites are not personalized to the specific context of a unique individuals circumstances. The one review fits all model works well, but Foursquare is looking to bring more context to recommendations to personalize the recommendations users of their apps get to make them more meaningful to each person. Nina Yiamsamatha, a member of Foursquares small business marketing team, discusses the importance of local personalized recommendations to help small businesses be more efficient and effective in building long-lasting relationships with consumers today, and how their approach differs from the more traditional approach to serving up recommendations. * * * * * Ive been at Foursquare for almost four years, working on primarily marketing from both the consumer and the business side, as well as supporting our global community. Weve had local business owners claim their business on Foursquare. To claim basically means to take control of your listing and make sure the information is up to date and engage customers using Foursquare at your business. So thats always been there. The most exciting developments were probably in August last year. We launched our self-service advertising platform for local business, and now we have self-service advertisers. Local businesses advertising in over 80 countries around the world, and thats been very, very exciting. It actually all fits in pretty perfectly in terms of the vision of the company. Dennis, our CEO, built Foursquare in order to support local communities and help local business and small businesses really stand out. So the concept of checking in was both social, but also about people connecting the places they love around the world. Thats still the same goal. Check-ins isnt a part of the new Foursquare app. Its about searching for and discovering really great places. So youre still connecting people with places, but not everyone wants to check in. What weve done is make that even easier for people to find and discover places, and make it more personal, focused on personalization, not just finding the same results no matter where you are. If you and I were each searching online for a burger, wed get the same results. But in fact, maybe Foursquare knows I like burgers with fried eggs, or I like specific types of veggie burgers, and you like rib eyes. Thats the kind of results that will be different for the two of us. Absolutely. As a company, were solving the problem with global search tools. Everyone gets the same results, right? So if Im a vegetarian and youre a carnivore, or a steak eater, we shouldnt get the same results and thats just broken. So in order to personalize results, we have all this great data from the past five years of, like you said, where people have gone, where their friends have gone. We think the future of global search is personalized. It isnt just everyone getting the same thing. So when you go to Amazon, the bookmark innovations you get are very different from what Id get. Same with Netflix. It really learns what movies and genres you love, and then based on that, will give you recommendations so you can have a better entertainment experience. So its the same thing, but for places that you go to, and the real world, and businesses that you frequent and that you want to be a loyal customer to inevitably. Absolutely. Not only getting new customers in the door, but how to engage with them, because we know when people have found your business through our app. The first thing is to claim your business, or take control of your listing. We hope its even easier to get started, and what you get for a $20.00 one-time fee is the ability to control your information and update various details about your business such as whether you accept reservations, whether you have extra seating or Wi-Fi. You also get access to analytics. So you can get to know your new customers, your top customers, as well as distribution over time of whos coming in. Thats very valuable information you wouldnt otherwise have. Yes, you can go to .","Webinars are a great way to market your small business online because they build: There are a number of solid webinar servicesavailable online for hosting webinars.

Below are the top reasons why business owners take the step to incorporate or form an LLC. See if any apply to you. When youre operating your business as a or partnership, theres no separation between the business and the owner. In this case, the owners are the business. Theyre responsible for signing any contracts, and taking out any loans or lines of credit on a personal level. In addition, if theres any kind of issue with the business (i.e. a customer sues or creditors seek action), the owners are personally liable. That means personal assets and savings can be at risk. One important reason for incorporating a company or forming an LLC is to protect the owners/stockholders against personal liability. These official business structures put a wall between the owner and the business. As long as the company complies with all the necessary corporate formalities, then creditors/court judgments generally cannot reach an owners personal assets to satisfy the companys liabilities. For this reason, people usually want to incorporate/form an LLC before launching their product or service, since the risk of liability increases once you add in customers, users or clients. When a business has more than one founder, theres always a chance of an argument over how equity should be split  no matter how close the owners may be. Incorporating a company and issuing stock to the founders will prevent misunderstandings among equity splits. Even if you choose to form an LLC and not issue stock, you will still have formal paperwork in place that outlines how ownership is split. Many entrepreneurs choose to compensate third parties (i.e. employees, vendors or contractors) by granting stock options or offering the opportunity to purchase equity at a low price. This is particularly attractive at the beginning of a business when cash is tight. It is possible to put together a pre-incorporation agreement stating that someone will get equity (stock) upon incorporation, but its a lot simpler to incorporate the company first, and then make these kind of offers. If a third party investor wants to invest in your business, there obviously needs to be some kind of entity set up to accept the investment. Venture capitalists and other investors often prefer to work with corporations, since they allow for different classes of stock. If youre not looking for VC or angel funding, you still may benefit from a formal business structure. Thats because owners in partnerships and sole proprietorships need to sign contracts in their own name. That means youll need to rely on your personal credit and assets to take out a loan or ask for a line of credit. But once you form an LLC or corporation, the business itself begins its own credit profile. You may find your sales grow after forming an LLC or incorporating, as adding an LLC or Inc. after your company name boosts your credibility in the eyes of some customers. In some industries, a formal business structure is required to win certain contracts. Some larger companies are more comfortable hiring a business, rather than a sole proprietor to do the work. When you incorporate or form an LLC, theres an added layer of privacy. In many cases, the registered agent of your corporation goes on record, and not your home or business address. In some cases, corporate tax rates are lower than individual tax rates. Corporations and LLCs often qualify for additional tax benefits and deductions that arent available to individuals. Many sole proprietors choose to incorporate as a way to lower what they owe in self-employment (SE) taxes. Of course, specific circumstances vary, and you should consult with a CPA or tax advisor about your own particular tax situation. is a big step, but offers some key benefits, even for the small, solo or family-owned business. Having an Inc. or LLC after your company name isnt just for big business. Just keep in mind that once you decide to create a formal business structure, youll have to keep up with ongoing filing obligations. But it might be one of the smartest steps you take for your business and personal finances.","When you are running your own online business, you need to be a master of many trades.

While Periscope is hotter than a Phoenix sidewalk in July, it can be a bit intimidating to folks new to the platform. After all, youre going to be talking in front of a live audience and you want to at least like you know what youre doing. Thats whythis guide was created. Once you work your way through our guide, you should be ready not only to hold your first broadcast, but also to make it a success. Ready? Periscope up! Simply put, Periscope enables you to go live via your mobile device anytime and anywhere. The app enables you to become your own on the go broadcasting station, streaming video and audio to any viewers who join your broadcast. Periscope is an app that truly takes advantage of its mobile platform incorporating notifications and location as well as social sharing (on Twitter of course), live discussions and feedback. A Periscope broadcast in full swing is a truly interactive event: Once a broadcast is over, others can watch a replay, and even provide feedback, within Periscope for up to 24 hours. After that, the broadcast is removed from the app. Never fear however, each of your broadcasts can be saved to your mobile device and, once youve got it there, it can be published and shared online just like any other video. There are many ways you can from insider videos to live Q&A sessions and beyond. Periscope is also a great tool to use to show off your skills, especially if youre a speaker. Professional speaker Marquesa Pettway (CSP, DTM) teaches entrepreneurs how to use speaking to grow their business and is a big fan of Periscope. I love periscope, Pettway says. Ive got a few broadcasts under my belt and have found that its your chance to share your expertise, your love of life, your neighborhood or just your perspective with people that already know about you while also attracting new people that turn into followers and maybe even clients. Just get on there and share your heart and youll get hearts in return. This section walks you through using Periscope by focusing on five areas: The first step in using Periscope is to download it to your or device. The first time you launch the app, youll be asked to sign in: You can sign in using your Twitter account or you can use your phone number however, if you want to easily make the most of the social aspect of Periscope, using your Twitter handle is recommended. If you have more than one Twitter handle, you can add the additional ones using the Add Account function under the Twitter settings on your device: There are four primary tabs in the Periscope app. The first tab displays two lists: The second tab in the app has two views, both of which show a global list of live public broadcasts that you can join. You can flip between both the list and map views by using the selector at the top of the screen: The third tab is your broadcast booth: The final tab is where you can look up folks to follow. Note that the number of followers displayed refers to how many Periscope followers a person has, not how many Twitter followers. This is also where you access your profile and other settings: As you can see in the screenshot above, theres a little blank headshot in the top right  touch that to access your Periscope profile as well as your settings: In terms of functionality and information, this screen is robust: Under the settings slider, there are some other useful features including a way to share Periscope, find help, send feedback, view legal information and finally, log out of the app. To watch a live broadcast on Periscope, head on over to either the list or map version of the global broadcast tab and touch an existing event that interests you. If your notifications are turned on, youll also learn about a live broadcast when: In the example below, youll see how to watch a broadcast replay that, except for interaction via comments, is exactly the same as watching a live broadcast. First, select the broadcast by touching it on your watch screens replay list (in this case, youll be watching, Speakerprenuers: The Journey): The broadcast starts at once. As you can see below, there are a few moving parts here: When you click on the little person at the bottom right of the broadcast screen, youll be taken to the following screen: Since this is a replay, theres no broadcast showing currently in the top part of the screen. Here are some things you can do however: Scrolling down on this page enables you to see who watched this broadcast live and during a replay as well as the viewers who sent hearts and how many hearts they sent. Finally, you can report a broadcast if you found it offensive or inappropriate in some way. Be aware that you can watch a broadcast on your Mac or PC. All you need to do is click on the link when someone shares it. At this time however, you cannot comment or give hearts when youre watching this way. One last note on watching a broadcast: if there are too many people in a broadcast, only those who arrived early can make comments. If you join a popular broadcast, you may be shown this screen: Consider yourself warned  if you want to chat during a popular broadcast, join ASAP. Finally, we come to the heart of Periscope, sending your own live broadcasts. When you first visit the broadcast screen, youll see the following popup: First, enable all three options as the first two are necessary for video and audio and the third can be shut off for individual broadcasts. Next youll be taken to the broadcast set up screen: Look through this screen one step at a time: From there, its just like watching a broadcast except youre the one on the screen! One important tip: if you need to change which camera your mobile device is using (if youve enabled comments, you really want to be watching the screen during a broadcast), double tap the screen to switch. After the broadcast, youll be able to see some metrics: As you can see, the broadcast has been sent to your camera roll and thats where you can grab it to publish or share it online. One note, the video above does not show any of the comments, joins or hearts  they currently seem to be shown only when watching a broadcast live or as a replay within the Periscope app. If you scroll down, you can see everyone who attended the live broadcast as well as those who watched the broadcast as a replay. In addition, you can see how many hearts the broadcast received and which folks gave them to you. From this point on, and for 24 hours, your followers will be able to share and watch a replay of your broadcast where they can continue to give you hearts. Periscope is hot and bound to get hotter, especially given Twitters popularity with celebrities. While its almost impossible to cover every nook and cranny of the app, this guide is a great place to start. So dont wait. Get in there and start using Periscope.

Its a trend that Ive been watching closelyand its also one that Ive frequently been able to participate in myself, especially as gets closer. There are two reasons why Ive been able to easily monitor this trend: Its Ted Turners fault. He launched , the worlds first 24 hour television news network, in 1980. This game-changing move enabled people from all over the world, ( ) to learn about important events in real-time, day and night.

This show provides me with the latest news, plus lots of expert political discussion delivered in a pretty balanced way. Everybodys talking. Anyone with Internet access can sign-up for a free account on Twitter or Facebook, and start spewing out their thoughts and opinions on any topic imaginable. People are even reporting the news, themselves. Theyre called citizen journalists, and they have an audience. 1/3 of all adults now . ( ) The social networks are also a place it seems, to follow politics during an election season. Theyre also a great place to learn about the companies and individuals you do business withor want to. And, its where I learned about the following items According to their mission statement, (IFA) protects, enhances, and promotes franchising. This Washington, DC based trade group and non-profit association represents more than 1,300 franchise systems, thousands of franchisees, and 500+ franchise business suppliers. Theyre also deeply involved in politics, hence their Washington DC address. I guess that I was a bit naive when I first became involved with the consulting part of the industry. I didnt know that the IFA was so involved in lobbying. But, thanks to the openness of the Internet, I do now. FranPac is the Political Action Committee of the IFA, and they just hit a milestone; $1 million in receipts for the 2012 election year. (Receipts are contributions from IFA members.)

The flip flops feature a picture of each candidate, and sell for $25 a pair. CEO John Schattner estimates that Obamacare, set to go into effect in 2014, will cost his company about 11 to 14 cents per pizza or 15 to 20 cents per order.

The tide is turning in the bond market and this is having wide implications on the currency market. Thankfully, the rupee is holding up for now. But the good news for today is that the specter of an immediate Fed rate hike appears to have got lifted and this is helping stock markets to rally. But one prominent analyst says the medium-term trajectory of the Sensex would be downward to hit the 26,000 mark by December! All of these and more in today's digest of news, views and cues that may have changed your market while you were sleeping. Rupee stands out amid Asian currency rout : The tide has just turned in bond markets amid increasing doubts about the ability of major central banks to offer fresh stimulus. This has hurt investor sentiment towards most emerging Asian currencies. Investors are also growing wary ahead of policy meetings of the Federal Reserve and the BOJ next week. The Chinese yuan's bearish bets increased to the largest since late July. Malaysia's ringgit was one of main victims with its bearish bets at the highest since late May. But the rupee is somewhat standing out, as it has bucked the regional trend with bullish bets moving up. Trade deficit narrows : Government data on Thursday showed India's trade deficit narrowed in August, as a double-digit slide in imports has outpaced a smaller drop in exports. The trade deficit in the first five months of the financial year has fallen by more than 40 per cent to $34.7 billion. The positive shift in the terms of trade has helped shield India from slowing global growth and helped it outperform other major emerging economies -- its growth rate of more than 7 per cent outpacing China's slowing economy. Trump offers income-tax bait : Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump unveiled a plan on Thursday for $4.4 trillion in tax cuts, offering less generous tax breaks than his original $10 trillion plan but proposing to cut the current top rate for the wealthiest taxpayers. Trump's proposal would reduce the top individual rate to 33 per cent from the current 39.6 per cent. It would raise the standard deduction and cap itemised deductions, which he said would reduce tax loopholes. It remains to be seen if American voters fall for the bait. Mega road sector push on the anvil : A Rs 1.5 lakh crore mega government push coming in the road sector. The Highways Ministry has pledged to kick off one project every week in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh as part of the central government's ambitious development agenda for the state. This will add up to new road projects worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore in the state, where elections are scheduled to be held early next year. This should be good news for the companies in the construction and road sectors. Fed hike risk gone for now: A more-than-expected drop in US August retail sales and manufacturing output print almost removed the cloud of possible Fed rate hike on Thursday, lifting stocks in the US markets in overnight trade and across Asia this morning. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly gained more than 200 points before closing about 180 points higher, with Apple contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent, with information technology and energy advancing more than 1 percent to lead advancers. The Nasdaq composite outperformed, rising 1.4 per cent, with Apple gaining 3.4 per cent. Sensex heading towards 26K? Forget the recent buoyancy in the stock market, the BSE Sensex has to head towards the 26,000 mark by December. Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist of BofA Merrill Lynch, stuck his neck out to claim he arrived at that target by taking the projected earnings growth for the year and FY18 and applying an average PE multiple to that. The downside on multiples would get you to about 26,000. But he says it will become an opportunity to buy because India is instituting several reforms. Oil prices looking up : Crude oil prices rose about 2 per cent on Thursday, ending a two-day slide as prices tracked a surge in gasoline futures and higher US equity markets. Prices remained lower for the week so far. Over the previous two sessions, oil fell 6 per cent, pressured by data showing large weekly builds in US petroleum products and forecasts by the world's energy watchdog and OPEC that signalled the global crude glut could persist into 2017. Brent crude futures rose 62 cents to $46.47 per barrel while WTI Intermediate futures climbed 19 cents to $44.77 a barrel.","Dell says its latest tablet, the new , is the thinnest on the market to date. But it may be more than the thickness of the new Dell Venue that gets peoples attention. In fact, the camera is the same thickness as the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 (6 mm). No, whats really impressive about the tablet is the Intel RealSense Snapshot Depth Camera. The rear mounted camera features 3D filters that allow users to measure depth and distance from a photograph. That essentially means it can take 3D photos. In a post on Direct2Dell, the official Dell Corporate Blog, Vice President of Consumer Marketing Neil Hand explains: The 3D camera is actually three cameras in one with a main camera on the rear of the device mounted just above two smaller cameras that together enable the overall 3D effect. In addition, the cameras Gallery app makes it possible not only to enhance the cameras 3D features but also to adjust color, tone and to manipulate various layers of your photos. cNet : Dell also touts the 8.4-inch OLED display on the new Dell Venue 8 7000 Series tablet. The screen resolution boasts 2560 x 1600 pixels. Thetablet also has other features which should allow it to be easily integrated into various aspects of your business workflow. The new Dell Venue 8 also can be accessorized with the Dell Cast adapter. This allows users to project their tablets screen to a desktop or laptop computer or a TV. If these devices are connected to a keyboard and mouse, the tablet can be operated like a regular computer. The device is expected to go on sale in November with pricing still to be announced.","Weve all heard of huge investments and acquisitions in the world of tech startups. Last year alone saw . And there was also news of for further expansion. In fact, we even saw some failed attempts like . (Perhaps they wouldnt have been so eager had they known .) Anyway, many small business owners online dont happen to be developing the next great iPhone app. Instead, a blog or other website with unique niche news or other content is more likely to be their product. And though big investments and acquisitions in the world of independent news brands may be somewhat unsung, it turns out they are no less prevalent. In fact, big investments and acquisitions in the world of independent news brands is kind of old news. Remember when Amazon CEO Jeff Brazos personal investment firm Brazos Explorations led a $5 million round of funding for Business Insider last year? It turns out as recently as late 2013, AOL had offered to pay between $100 and $150 million for the business news site. But talks eventually broke down over price, Fox News . And, of course, most memorable of all might be AOLs other big news acquisition. In 2011, the online media giant . Though AOLs other investments, most notably its . So it should be no surprise to learn that Mashable has raised $13 million in private equity funding  even if its the first funding the news site has received in its near decade of existence. CNN News investors include Updata Partners, New Markets Venture Partners, Social Starts, Buddy Media Co-Founders Michael and Kass Lazerow, Iglo Group Chief Executive Elio Leoni Sceti, and Havas global CEO David Jones. There are some simple lessons other independent news brands can take from Mashables success: Mashable CEO Pete Cashmore founded the company at age 19 as a blog he ran from his home in Aberdeen, Scotland. From there it has survived and thrived into a news site that now claims to receive 30 million unique visitors per month. With the digital publishing tools available now, independent news publishers need little more than unique content to start them out. So money for expansion can wait until later. Mashable started as a blog about technology and matured into a news site dedicated to the social media space. But since then, its coverage has expanded to include business, entertainment and other subjects. While early coverage was largely regurgitation of material already on the Web, the company continues to do more original reporting. Hiring additional editorial talent like Jim Roberts, a veteran of both The New York Times and Reuters, shows a commitment to more of the same. Certainly most online publishers can start today with very little investment using available tools. But that doesnt mean independent news sites should ignore investing in new tech solutions. At a social media summit, Cashmore that the greatest challenge faced by online publishers was lack of control over reader experience. (Is your reader coming to your site using an iPad or Kindle tablet? What difference does this make in his or her experience?) To address the issue, Mashable has built products like its Google Glass app. The company also has a special products division aimed at creating technology to help readers consume its content in a variety of ways. See the video of Cashmore and Mashable CEO, Robyn Peterson, at Internet Week New York 2013: Bottom line: Mashable shows independent news brands may require a more gradual, long-term growth plan than some other tech businesses, but investments are low to start and rewards can be significant.","The January jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provided good news. Non-farm employment increased by 257,000 jobs, exceeding the consensus expectation of economists. And the November-to-January numbers showed the largest three-month rise in employment in seven years. The robust job creation numbers mean that the economy has now replaced the positions lost during the Great Recession. BLS data show that more Americans are employed now than were working in November 2007. Job creation looks even stronger when examined during the current economic recovery alone. Employment has risen by 9.9 million when measured on a seasonally-adjusted basis (and 6.9 million on an unadjusted basis) since June 2009. The good employment news, however, confounds what has happened to the self-employed and those employed by others. The job creation story is far worse for the self-employed than it is for the economy as a whole. From June 2009 to January 2015, the overall self-employment rate, which measures the fraction of those employed who work for themselves, either as the head of a corporation or in an unincorporated business, declined from 10.9 percent to 10.1 percent. Because the self-employment rate measures the fraction of those employed who are working for themselves, a decline means that self-employment is not keeping up with the creation of jobs for others. In fact, employment numbers for the two groups have moved in opposite directions during the recovery. Since June 2009, employment by others has risen by 5 percent, when measured on a seasonally-unadjusted basis. By contrast, self-employment has declined by 3.9 percent over the same period. Employment by others has recovered from the Great Recession, but self-employment has not. While 2.7 million more people (measured on an unadjusted basis) work for others now than did so in November 2007, 783 thousand fewer people are self-employed. The figure aboveshows the number of self-employed and wage employed by others as a percentage of the levels in November 2007, the month before the Great Recession began. While the wage and self-employment declined by roughly the same percentage during the Great Recession, the jobs recovery has been much stronger in wage employment than in self-employment. The big laggard in job creation is the unincorporated self-employed. While incorporated self-employment is not up quite as much as employment by others since June 2009 (3.1 percent versus 5.0 percent), both numbers have increased. However, unincorporated self-employment has dropped by 7.6 percent since the current expansion began.","Along with its quarterly earnings call today, announced that it had acquired email marketing software provider for $169 Million cash and stock. Entrepreneurs and small business managers may be most familiar with Vocus through its PRWeb product. PRWeb seems to be on every short list of press release distribution services for small businesses. However, Vocus serves larger corporations, too, with its public relations products. In October 2011 Vocus added a marketing suite for SMBs. The cloud-based marketing suite provides a combination of social media monitoring, publicity monitoring, and a Facebook app/landing page creation tool. With this acquisition of iContact, Vocus is now adding into the mix the ability to offer email marketing services.  iContact has a customer base of 70,000 small and mid-sized businesses, according to Rick Rudman, CEO of Vocus (although it wasnt clear how many of those may overlap with already existing customers of PRWeb and other Vocus products). Vocuss goal is to provide an all-in-one suite  presumably with less of a learning curve. In a video interview accompanying the press release, Rudman said that small business owners and marketers just do not have the time to go out and learn 5 or 6 different packages. Rudman went on to say that Vocus will continue to support the iContact product and will have the same iContact support team in place. iContact was founded in 2003 by Ryan Allis and Aaron Houghton while they were students at University of North Carolina.Under the terms of the deal, which closed on February 24, 2012, Vocus acquired iContact for approximately $91 million of cash, $9 million of common stock and $79 million of redeemable convertible preferred stock, aggregating $169 million of total consideration, net of $10 million cash acquired. Thats a large acquisition for a company the size of Vocus. Vocus trades on the NASDAQ, and as such its financials are reported publicly. Reported annual revenue for Vocus was roughly $115 Million for 2011, an increase of 19% over 2010. However, the company lost $4.2 Million (on a GAAP basis)for the year 2011. Theres been a lot of acquisition activity over the past year among companies that provide marketing services to small businesses. In particular, weve seen a . Its still a highly fragmented marketplace with so many tools it will make your head spin  if you can even understand what they all do  or dont do. Some consolidation and integration is not only to be expected, but in the long run will be a good thing. Having fewer companies and better integrated products will drive out inefficiencies from the daily marketing activities of small businesses, and make small businesses like ours more effective.","There are many good reasons to start your own business from the independence it can bring to your lifestyle to the noble role you can play in helping to grow the economy, create jobs and opportunity and improve the world through a great product or service.

How can entrepreneursstay positive enough to see success eventually intheir own ventures?","  BENGALURU/NEW DELHI Indian bond and share prices rose as investors welcomed the long-awaited passage of a goods and services tax (GST), though gains were tempered by concerns about the amount of work needed to bring the reforms into reality. The Nifty pared earlier strong gains to close 0.07 percent higher, after climbing as much as 0.7 percent earlier in the session. The benchmark 10-year bond yield was down 2 basis points (bps) at 7.18 percent. The GST passage in the Rajya Sabha paves the way for the rollout of India's single biggest tax reform since independence, one that harmonises 11 state and central levies into a national sales tax and cuts business transaction costs. Its passage marks a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he seeks to boost growth in Asia's third-largest economy, and is a relief for investors, especially overseas, who'd been growing impatient about the pace of reforms. Economists project the GST could add 0.4 to 0.8 percentage points to India's economic growth within three to five years of the rollout. ""This is an encouraging sign that Modi's slow-and-steady approach to reforms is making headway,"" said Kenneth Akintewe, Asia fixed income senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, in Singapore.  ""The infrastructure to enforce the tax needs to be set up, while crucial details  such as the GST rate, exemptions and dispute resolution mechanisms  still need to be hammered out."" Fitch Ratings welcomed the move as an important signal of the government's ability to pass reforms. ""Parliamentary approval sends a further positive signal of the government's ability to enact major reforms following the passage of a national bankruptcy law in May,"" the ratings agency said in a statement.  But Moody's Investors Service said the short-term credit implications of GST for the sovereign ""will be limited"" given the time that would be needed for implementation. Among tasks that need to be accomplished, the government and companies from sectors such as automakers and logistics will also need to implement new technology structures in preparation for the new taxes. In the immediate-term, Nomura analysts warned the GST could negatively impact the economy as higher taxes hit consumption and push up inflation by 20-70 basis points in the first year of implementation.  ""Contrary to general perceptions, we believe that the short-term impact of the GST could be mixed, but the long-term impact will be clearly positive,"" Nomura said in a research note. Shares of automakers rose as the heavily-taxed sector is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a unified and national taxation system. The Nifty Auto Index rose as much as 1.91 percent with Tata Motors gaining 4.52 percent. Logistics firms also gained, with Shipping Corp of India up 2.58 percent and Transport Corp of India up 0.59 percent.

As a small business owner, you know the holidays are a crucial time to your bottom line. However, as many found out during the Polar Vortex last year, it is easy to lose a significant portion of those profits to high energy costs. The average small business spends almost $8,000 a year on electricity alone. Here are 5 easy ways you can cut costs and be a more energy efficient business. During the hectic holiday season your thermostats temperature setting is the farthest thing from your mind particularly with customers coming in and out. Programmable thermostats arent just for homes anymore and case studies have shown savings between 10-20% on average after installation. Today, most come with a mobile phone app that allows you to control them remotely. There are more thermostats on the market now than ever before and most of them can be found at any hardware store or online. Last year during the Polar Vortex several small business owners were hit with skyrocketing electricity costs because their business was on a variable rate plan. Now is the time to ensure you are on a fixed rate plan before the first winter storm of the season. If you wait until after the storm you could see electricity bills with rates up to 50% higher than you are currently paying. For example, several utilities in Massachusetts have planned an increase in excess of 15 cents per kilowatt-hour for the default rate starting in November, currently default rates range from 8 to 10 cents. By signing a fixed rate agreement with a supplier you can ensure your supply rate stays the same all year. LED lighting is one of the quickest ways small business owners can reduce their energy bill. The affect of the LED light is twofold. First, LED lights use up to 80% less electricity than the conventional halogen bulb. Second, LED lights put off significantly less heat than the conventional bulb meaning your A/C wont have to work as hard when the summer comes around. While the upfront costs can be expensive, the savings are more than worth it. A recent study showed that LED lights cost an estimated $6 a year to power compared to almost $34 for the standard 75W incandescent bulb. Additionally, adding timers to your light switches is one of the easiest ways you can positively impact your electricity bill. With the chaotic nature of the holiday season it is easy to forget to turn off the lights after leaving the office. Feel free to worry about one less minor detail with this trick. The holidays are already stressful enough for all of us. Dont add to that stress by having to schedule and pay for HVAC repairs in the middle of your busy holiday schedule. If your small business is in the retail industry it is also important to remember the comfort of your customers. Nothing is worse than going into a shop to beat the elements for a few minutes only to find out that the store is just as chilly as the weather outside. Several studies have shown that consumers are anywhere from 40-60% more likely to purchase from a company that is concerned about its environmental impact. Whether its gift wrapping, extra printing paper, or cardboard boxes look for ways to reduce unnecessary consumption and recycle whenever possible. When companies consider their environmental impact in everything they do it becomes part of the culture.

On the Google Official Blog, Eric Schmidt, the companys executive chairman introduced the new services : Heres Googles brief video overview of the new service: is free to try for 30 days. After that, users who want to continue using the service either $5 per month (for 30GB of cloud storage in Google Drive) or $10 per month (unlimited storage) per user. Some of the most accessible features include Google Apps for Work. Every user who signs up for Google for Work gets access to their own business email address. This email is run through the Gmail platform. Users also get access to the suite of Googles cloud services, like Calendar, Hangouts, and Drive. (These are, of course, enhanced premium versions of the free services Google provides to all its users.) There are pro versions of other Google apps too. One such app is the pro version of Maps which can also be on a monthly subscription basis. The pro version of Maps has a variety customization options which enhance its functionality when compared to the free service. According to the Maps Pro page, you can even import addresses from a spreadsheet onto a Google Map. You can then take and manipulate that data, plan business trips more effectively, or develop business strategies based on customer locations, for example. Another service in Googles premium suite is . This is largely for app developers who can use the space to test and run applications. But, of course, it can be used for data storage as well, just like many other cloud services. In fact, it seemed significant to see the move from Google so soon after made similar options available. Google has provided a calculator to help you determine how much storage youd need per month and it is billed based on those needs. Other for Work services being provided by Google for an additional subscription rate are Google and . Search for Work allows you to not only place a Google search box on your companys website. It also includes a separate feature that comes with an actual Google box. This feature of Search for Work allows you to comb through company files and data, all powered by Googles search technology. Chrome for Work sorts your business bookmarks and search histories, according to the companys site.","Punch cards for your repeat customers will soon be a thing of the past.But its difficult for small businesses to afford those plastic key cards that you might get from a place like a grocery store or gas station. Huzzah Media says its new is one solution. In fact, the company is targeting businesses with fewer than 10 employees that are still looking for ways to keep their valued customers coming back. Huzzah VP of Marketing Greg Garrick told Small Business Trends recently that a company survey found nearly half of all small business owners consider repeat customers key to their business success. However, less than 20 percent of them offer their customers a loyalty program. Cost in setting up such a program is a major obstacle. Huzzah says that some custom loyalty programs could cost a small business tens of thousands of dollars. In a company press release, Huzzahs VP of Product Development Lance Brown added: The Huzzah Loyalty program is fairly simple. Currently, the company is giving small businesses a chance to try it out for six months for a nominal fee: $1. After securing a credit card, Huzzah sends you an iPad to display at your business and a box of loyalty cards to give to your customers. When customers visit your store after receiving a loyalty card, all they need to do is swipe it or a QR code on their smartphone in front of the iPad to earn points. These points can be accrued toward rewards that you select as the business owner. In an interview with Small Business Trends, Brown said that his company works with small business owners to set up their unique loyalty program: After about five months, Huzzah contacts small businesses that have been using the loyalty program to gauge their interest going forward. Following the trial period, monthly subscriptions to Huzzahs platform range from $69 to $139. Businesses are required to enter into a one-year contract with Huzzah at that time. In addition to the loyalty program, Huzzah has also announced several other services aimed at small businesses competing with bigger ones. Huzzah will design a for your business, customized with your companys logo and color scheme. The companys website claims that you need no coding experience or design skills to get your app active. The company also places it on all the major app stores with a premium plan. Mobile apps designed through Huzzah range from $20 monthly up to $65. Huzzah also has a designed to drive traffic to your mobile app, website, and eventually your business. The ads are localized so that mobile users in your area are more likely to see your ad. Monthly subscriptions in Huzzahs mobile ad network get your business between 20,000 and 40,000 impressions for $100 and $200, respectively, the company says. Each level gets your business a banner ad and a mobile landing page when someone clicks on your ad.","There is a lot of information out there about local search and SEO, but the first step is, of course, understanding how it all works. If you wanted a quick and easy guide to give you an overview and send you in the right direction to learn more, this ones for you. The three major search engines for local are all very similar. You create your own business page, or business listing, and it will show up on a SERP as a local result. These results stand out on a page and look different than your typical results page, so they stand out. You are also working with less competition, so you have a better chance of ranking in front of a very targeted audience with local search. Below are two different ways that local listing stand out on Google. Some queries use the new Google carousel design: Other queries use the older design: The way that the local search results are displayed varies slightly from search engine to search engine, but the idea that local search results are less competitive and are more relevant to users still rings true across the board. Once again, you do not have one local business page that works for all search engines. If you want to get involved with Yahoo Local, you need a Yahoo Local page. If you wanted to get involved with all three engines, you will have three separate local pages (more on this in the next section). This is unfortunately probably the most confusing aspect of local search, but the confusion seems to be ending because Google is just about done making changes. In short, you used to need to setup a Google Places page, but then they came out with something called Google+ Local Pages for Business and then two existed. Now, they have merged the two and your new term is Google+ Places. Essentially: Google Places page + Google+ Local for Business = Google+ Places How you actually get started creating this Google+ Places page is discussed in the next section. Trust me, its not as confusing as it sounds. Yelp might not be considered one of the major search engines, but it is definitely a major search engine when it comes to local search specifically. Yelp is a network full of reviews and information about different businesses, and many people turn to Yelp before a major search engine. Yelp is also known to show up as an organic result on a local search query on Google, Bing, etc., so it should absolutely be part of your local strategy. Below is a screenshot of a Yelp business page (showing Yelps fairly new design): Yelp makes it easy to check-in on mobile so users can share with friends on social media and allows businesses to make special offers for users. One thing that throws beginners off quite often is the fact that you might need to claim your listing as opposed to create it. Even if you didnt put your business online, your business could still be a part of a search engine. This means that someone has already listed your business and the basics; however that person cannot make any major changes. You then need to claim your business. There are a few different ways to determine if you are listed somewhere else online: Dont forget that local search matters a lot for mobile! If youre still on the fence about whether or not you need a local strategy (hopefully not, but just in case), the mobile considerations should change your mind. I talked with Scott Langdon, Managing Partner of HigherVisibility, who explained that, People are much more likely to search for a local query on the go. You want your business to show up because people are likely already in their cars and looking for something quick and easy. This isnt always the case, but its a good chunk of the time. Its worth noting that all of your normal SEO efforts will transfer over into your local strategy. The only difference is that local SEO offers a few extra options for small businesses to really be successful. In other words, you may have been able to get away with showing up in local search in the past even if you didnt focus on local specifically. Unfortunately, those days are pretty much over. Using some of the tips above will be crucial to ranking well on a local SERP. Although it might seem overwhelming, I recommend taking it one step at a time. Start with Google local and Yelp, get comfortable, and then move to Yahoo and Bing and focusing on mobile. Its actually not so bad when you go step by step. Do you have any advice on local search?","he long-delayed Goods and Services Tax Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. Now a battle awaits its passage in the Rajya Sabha where the ruling National Democratic Alliance is in a minority. The Bill was taken up for consideration in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley appealed to all parties to rise above partisan considerations to support it but its fate in Rajya Sabha was still a matter of speculation. The GST framework could easily be one of the most important tax reforms for India. It brings with it problems regarding division of taxation powers between the Centre and the states. Which is why the finance ministry had missed a number of deadlines in the past. The implementation of GST will lead to the abolition of other taxes such as Octroi, Central Sales Tax, state-level sales tax, entry tax, stamp duty, telecom licence fees, turnover tax, tax on consumption or sale of electricity, taxes on transportation of goods and services, et cetera, thus avoiding multiple layers of taxation that currently exist in India. The obvious question that arises: what is GST all about and how will it impact us? We present here a brief fact sheet. Goods and Services Tax -- GST -- is a comprehensive tax levied on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods and services at a national level. Through a tax credit mechanism, this tax is collected on value-added goods and services at each stage of sale or purchase in the supply chain. The idea of GST was first mooted by the Vajpayee government when it set up the Asim Dasgupta Committee to study the feasibility and the subsequent implementation of a new form of indirect tax. Vajpayee government went out of power in 2004 and a new coalition, United Progressive Alliance, took over the reins. During 2007-2008 Budget, Palaniappan Chidambaram, then Union Finance Minister, announced that GST would be introduced from April 1, 2010. Chidambaram also said that the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, on his request, would work with the central government to prepare a road map. The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha by the UPA government in 2011, has lapsed and so the Modi government had to come up with a fresh Bill. The GST could not be implemented till now as many states and several political parties were opposing it. States are nervous about the GST as they think the Bill does not address their concerns over entry tax and taxation of petroleum products. Initially, it was decided to keep petroleum products out of the purview of GST. But in the wake of states' opposition, a revised draft of the Constitution amendment Bill put petroleum, though zero-rated, under GST because it is an input product. GST, a value-added tax, gives credit for taxes paid on inputs. The states argued that if petroleum is kept out, it will break the chain for input credits. Also, for the tax to be implemented, the Constitution had to be amended and a consensus needed to be reached with the states. The states objected to the Constitutional Amendment Bill as it did not contain provisions for giving states compensation against any possible loss of revenue after GST roll-out for five years. One of the main concerns of the states was the cumulative revenue loss that they will suffer once Central Sales Tax is removed. Since CST is levied by the Centre on the inter-state movement of goods and is collected by the states, the latter were demanding suitable compensation. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the Centre has allowed states to levy one per cent additional tax on inter-state trade for a period of two years. The Centre has also agreed to compensate the states for revenue loss arising out of GST implementation for a period that may extend up to five years. The GST Bill faced stiff opposition from parties like All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Biju Janata Dal. The AIADMK said it was against it as Tamil Nadu would lose over Rs 10,000 crore (Rs 100 billion) because of the new tax structure. The Congress too recently accused Bharatiya Janata Party of making U-turn and of practising subterfuge, deceit and a hidden agenda. However, the Congress made it clear that it was only opposing the manner of bringing in the GST Bill and not the concept, as the move for GST was initiated by the UPA. Under GST, the taxation burden will be divided equitably between manufacturing and services, through a lower tax rate by increasing the tax base and minimising exemptions. It is expected to help build a transparent and corruption-free tax administration. GST will be levied only at the destination point, and not at various points (from manufacturing to retail outlets). It is estimated that India will gain as implementation of GST would promote exports, raise employment and boost growth. In the GST system, both central and state taxes will be collected at the point of sale. Both components (the central and state GST) will be charged on the manufacturing cost. This will benefit individuals as prices are likely to come down. Lower prices will lead to more consumption, thereby helping companies. GST will not be an additional tax. CGST will include central excise duty (Cenvat), service tax, and additional duties of customs at the central level; and value-added tax, central sales tax, entertainment tax, luxury tax, octroi, lottery taxes, electricity duty, state surcharges related to supply of goods and services and purchase tax at the State level. The tax-rate under the proposed GST would come down, but the number of assesses would increase 5-6 times. VAT regulations and rates generally vary across states. States at times undercut rates to draw investors. This leads to a loss of revenue to both the state and the Centre. GST would introduce uniform taxation laws across states and different sectors. No. In short term, it may lead to higher inflation rates. But prices are expected to fall in the long term as dealers might pass on the benefits of the reduced tax to consumers. According to A K Bhattacharya, Editor, , far from creating a barrier-free pan-Indian market for smooth transaction of goods and services across the country, the GST system may well create new tax hurdles. Instead of improving tax compliance, there could be a strong incentive for tax payers to avoid the higher tax burden to be imposed by the new system, Bhattacharya wrote in one of his recent columns published in . The tax base too may not widen because of the many items that would be excluded from the GST chain, he said. And, most important, instead of enhancing the value of the country's economic activity, the proposed GST system may well be a dampener for achieving higher growth in gross domestic product. GST is likely to have a negative impact on small businesses, especially those in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector. The fear is that once GST is implemented, they will end up paying more tax than ever, which may force them to shut shop. Needless to add, MSME sector is an important contributor to the growith of India's GDP. The GST is likely to exclude potable alcohol, tobacco etc. The future of the Bill is still uncertain. For, despite the support of Trinamool Congress, the government is a minority in Rajya Sabha. However, The Biju Janata Dal, which had been opposing the Bill, joined the Trinamool Congress in dropping its demand that the constitutional amendment Bill for a goods and services tax be referred to a parliamentary standing committee on finance. This could pave the way for the Bill to overcome the Rajya Sabha hurdle.  Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were eager to get the GST Bill passed as according to an estimate, Indian economy will gain $15 billion a year if the GST is implemented. With globalisation, it is necessary that India's economy aligns with the best international practices. And this is where an efficient taxation system is a must. An inclusive tax system like the GST may be the answer.","  Leading smartphone maker has launched Samsung Galaxy Note 7 for Rs 59,900, with an aim to further strengthen its position in the premium smartphone segment.

We first broke the news on the deal talks last month, and after hiccups in valuation and other issues, the deal has been signed in principle and that an announcement could be made as early as this week. The deal will include Helio, now majority owned by SK Telecom (NYSE: SKM), injected into Virgin Mobile USA (NYSE: VM), and better-recognized Virgin brand will be retained. VMUS, which did its IPO on NYSE last October, will issue new shares, leaving SK Telecom holding close to 20 percent of the equity of the enlarged business, which will be worth about $50 million, the story says. SKT will also invest a nominal amount of cash in VMUSA. Virgin has about 5.1 million mobile customers, all of whom are on pay-as-you-go dealsHelio has about 200K, all post-paid. Will this deal make any material difference to VMUSAs chances of surviving in the long term? It will certainly give it some cash, and the Korean expertise in handset and advanced mobile service, for whatever that is worth. It will also give VM an entry into higher end handsets, higher ARPU customers, and better UI that comes with Helio, if they decide to use that. Distribution and still-relatively smaller scale remains an issue Possibly the best analysis and rationale of a merger comes from one of our commenters, who posted this in response to a previous post on Helio store closures: 1. Savings in operations by merging overlapping areas such as IT. This can reduce Helio","When I heard speak at BlogWorld, one thing that stood out was his statement, I realized he was completely right. Think about the last time you went to a website for a product or service that you couldnt buy outright online. Did it list prices? Or did the site encourage you to call for more information? How many times do you walk away from a purchase simply because you couldnt get enough information on pricing to make an informed decision? I know thats been the case for me in many instances. I think were afraid to talk about pricing on our websites because we want to convince potential customers of the value our products provide. Simply giving a number doesnt express how awesome our widgets and doohickeys are. But we, our companies salespeople, can expound upon the benefits our products provide! Theyre magical and worth every penny! Price does matter. No matter how magical your unicorn clone machine is, if its out of my budget, theres nothing you can do about that. I decided to write this post after I had an experience that hit home on this topic. I was looking into gyms in my area. I found one website, but it didnt list prices, so I called. My husband groaned in the background: I found out why. I was put through to the sales guy. I asked how much a family membership was. His response? Instantly, I was put off. I explained I simply wanted to get pricing, not sign up for anything. We proceeded to get into an argument; he said I was reducing his product to a price. He wanted to talk about value. I told him I was familiar with his brand, and I just wanted information on pricing to help me make a decision.I got frustrated and got off the phone. Guess what gym I t sign up with? Bingo. There it is. As business owners, we hate the idea of customers reducing our product to a price. But they do. If I hadnt considered that gym of the quality I was looking for, with the services I needed, I wouldnt have called. If all things are equal, price is the one factor that will help us make our decision most of the time. Am I right? But the fact that the salesperson made getting this information a headache turned me off, and I walked away. In Sheridans presentation, he quizzed several members of the audience on whether or not they listed pricing on their sites. One man in software development, when asked why he didnt list pricing, said: And thats the case for a lot of us. It depends on what the client wants; how big he is; how many he wants. But Sheridan shot that down and said thats the case for everyone in the room, and it simply isnt an excuse. I get it now. I just listed prices (at least, starting prices) on my site as a result of this lesson learned. My goal is to at least weed out the people who cant afford what my company offers, and to create a starting point for the pricing conversation. Well see if it draws more clients or makes it easier for potential clients to make a decision. If you dont list prices on your site currently, change that. Even if it depends, list prices starting at and see what happens. Direct potential clients to your site so they can understand what to expect with regards to costs. Lets get out of the habit of pushing customers away by closely guarding pricing as a big secret! Are you with me?","You dont need a big budget to . There are many inexpensive or even out here.

It is very possible  and a lot of people do this  to make a Facebook page, and then link it to your domain. So it is not really a proper site But if your Facebook page is the central hub for your customers to come and communicate with you, then you may very well decide to just use this as your website. Be aware though that Facebook is starting to demand that all page owners start paying for advertising to have their posts shown to followers. If you dont, then a lot of posts will not be shown to customers due to lack of engagement  which is Facebook talk for pay up now. People use Evernote as a digital brain to store everything that they dont want to forget. But if you are a premium customer, you can also make notebooks in Evernote which can be shared with anyone, even those without an Evernote account. These notebooks can then be given a domain name or a shortened URL. Its not the perfect website for every business, but its one low cost option to consider. Angies List is similar to Yelp in that businesses are reviewed by customers, and you can use those reviews, as well as your business details, as a basic webpage. You can claim your   on the site, and apparently Angies List visitors look for companies that they need on the site. So Angies List could end up becoming one of your biggest sources for referrals. Every reviewed has its own page URL, and this can also make an ideal webpage for, say, restaurants, bars and other brick and mortar businesses. The page shows your businesss opening and closing times, photos, customer reviews, and directions. For many businesses, that will be more than enough. And having Yelp as a website requires zero effort on your part. The customers keep the page updated with their reviews. So all you need to do is keep them happy.

At the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude palm oil for delivery in October moved up by Rs 4.80, or 0.87 per cent to Rs 553.60 per 10 kg in business turnover of 36 lots. On similar lines, the oil for delivery in September contracts edged up by Rs 4.40, or 0.78 per cent to Rs 571.30 per 10 kg in 76 lots.

Unlike those who are employed and receive paychecks where taxes are withheld by the employer, most business owners and the self-employed will be required to periodically send an amount called estimated tax payments to the IRS. You may also have to send estimated tax payments to your state taxing authority. In other words, most small business owners must pay estimated taxes quarterlyand not wait until April 15 or when other tax payers file their returns. Those quarterly installments are for the amount we estimate we will owe. If we do not send in estimated tax payments, we could end up paying hefty penalties, which are essentially interest for your overdue quarterly payments. If you are a small business owner, be sure to take the tax calendar into account when developing a cash flow budget for your business. To learn more, Small Business Trends spoke with Michael Hanley, Managing Partner of the Smithtown, N.Y. CPA Firm . Hanley is also the author of three small business books including and For Federal Income Tax purposes, estimated tax payments are due as follows: Notice that the January 15 quarterly payment is actually due not in the tax year itself, but early the following year (but before your tax return is due). Note also, that if the date falls on a weekend or holiday it may be extended to the next business day. If you are in a state where you are required to make state income tax estimated payments, pay your state estimated tax by December 31st. That way, you can claim a deduction for the tax payment in the current tax year. Keep in mind that for most small businesses its typically the  not the business entity itself  required to make estimated tax payments. Thats because most small business entities, such as LLCs, are what is known as pass-through entities for tax purposes. According to Hanley, Small businesses typically do not make quarterly estimated payments due to the fact that most small businesses are set up as flow-through or pass-through entities, which means that all taxes are paid at the personal level. This means that the vast majority of all estimated payments would be paid by the , not by the businesses themselves. Remember that some business entities (example: non-pass-through entities) are in fact required to pay estimated taxes on behalf of the business entity itself. These include C Corporations, S Corporations that conduct business in New York City, and S Corporations that conduct business in Washington, DC. The requirement to pay estimated taxes has some exceptions. Calculating the correct amount of your estimated tax payments can be complicated. The IRS has a (PDF) that includes a worksheet you can use to calculate your estimated tax payments. In general: Use a CPA to help you prepare your taxes. Have the CPA generate an estimated tax payment schedule with amounts each year. Do this for the upcoming tax year, at the time you file your taxes for the previous year. Then follow that payment schedule exactly, unless your income or deductions change significantly. When calculating your quarterly or end of the year tax liability, always be sure you are considering your businesss whole financial picture. As Hanley explains: Too many small business owners get caught up in the myth that whatever my business bank account balance is on December 31 is what I will have to pay tax on. While the December 31 bank account balance can be a very useful figure when performing a quick cash flow calculation, it tends to be VERY misleading when determining the profitability of a business. Items like paying down debt, borrowing money, carrying credit card balances, paying personal expenses, repaying shareholder loans, distributing profits to the owners, etc. will all impact how much money is in the bank at the end of the year, but will have no impact on the business profit. When calculating your estimated quarterly tax amounts, be sure to calculate based on profit  in other words, income minus expenses. If you did not pay enough in estimated tax payments (or other tax sources such as withholding), you will have to pay a penalty. You can avoid the penalty as long as you pay at least 90% of the tax for the current year, or 100% of the tax you owed for the prior year, whichever is smaller. Special rules also apply to farmers and fishermen. Also, if failure to pay is due to a natural disaster, you may get a pass from the IRS. Like any tax rule, the penalties have various exceptions. See IRS instructions on Form 1040-ES for more. (Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax), also has more information. The IRS and most states allow for electronic payments of estimated taxes, in addition to paper filing. If you can file electronically, Hanley says, its a good choice because you have better proof of payment. Online payment confirmation is always more concrete than any proof of mailing or proof of delivery that the post office can provide. You can make electronic payments of your federal taxes through the . In most cases, electronic filing also gives you the ability to schedule future payments. Avoid the need to remember or set calendar reminders throughout the year, by scheduling all four estimated payments at once, electronically. If your state has an income tax, most likely you are required to pay estimated tax payments toward your state income tax, also. Nine states on wage income. States that do not have personal income tax include: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. New Hampshire and Tennessee do not tax wage income, but do tax interest and dividend income. However, be sure to check for any other business tax filing requirements. Go to find a list of state tax offices you can contact to find out if your state is one where estimated income tax payments are required. You can also find other information and appropriate forms or electronic filing links for each state. Stay out of hot water by knowing your responsibilities for estimated tax payments at the state and federal level. Just as important as knowing the rules and requirements, you need to get yourself organized so you dont inadvertently forget and slip up accidentally.

This is probably not surprising to anyone whos watched the development of other significant social media properties over the years. Facebook, Twitter and have all moved to sponsored or promoted content models as at least one potential way to ultimately monetize their operations.But Pinterest seems especially cautious about its monetizing strategy. In a recent post on the official Pinterest blog, company CEO and co-founder Ben Silbermann tried to users: The video below explains how Pinterest works: Instead, Silbermann promised users of the site any advertising would be tasteful, transparent and relevant. He also said Pinterest would take users feedback into account to improve the promoted pins over time. To start, Silbermann says Pinterest will likely try some test pins in the sites current search results and category feeds.But he stressed these promoted pins will not actually be sponsored by anyone. They will simply be tests to gain some feedback from the community. Silbermann explained one specific example of how this might work would be promoting, say, a Batman costume under a search for the term Halloween. Pinterest is probably right to be cautious. Last year, the companys experiments with , an affiliate linking service, caused a bit of a stir. Enough so that Silbermann took time to the companys position and add some new disclosure language to the Pinterest site. The lesson is a good one for all small businesses. Many comments on Silbermanns most recent post were supportive of the sites need to eventually advertise. The important thing is to be transparent with customers about what youre doing and why. The prospect of Pinterest sponsored pins also raises important opportunities for businesses already using the site for marketing. It will be important for those businesses to keep watching as Pinterest ventures into the world of paid content.","It happens. At times, hardworking and well-intentioned small business owners fail to meet their legal obligations with the state, and their businesses fall into bad standing. No matter how you got yourself into a non-compliant status, it is possible to get back into good standing and reinstate a non-compliant business. Fortunately, in many cases, its not as difficult a road as you might think. If your company is in bad standing with the state, its a good idea to bring it back into compliance before the end of the year. Thats because ignoring the problem wont make it go away. The penalties and fees will catch up to you eventually. So its typically better to deal with the issue as soon as possible and start the new year with a clean slate. If your business is not in bad standing, the following can still help you understand how to meet your legal obligations and avoid these problems in the first place. A corporation or LLC falls into bad standing when it fails to meet the requirements of the state where it formed or where it has a foreign qualification. Here are some of the common culprits: When a company doesnt meet its legal obligations, it can be placed in non-compliant status, administratively dissolved or even revoked by the state where it formed. Any unpaid fees and taxes will continue to accrue, and youll most likely have some hefty penalty fines added on top. In addition, when a business is in bad standing, the business owner no longer enjoys the limited liability protection of the LLC or corporation. That means that his or her personal assets are now vulnerable. If your business is sued, the plaintiff may seek damages from your personal savings. Likewise, if you continue to fail to pay your business taxes or fees, the state may be able to place a levy on your personal bank account. In many cases, your business (or your registered agent) will receive a notice from the state telling you that youre in non-compliant status. If you are not sure how your business stands with the state (for example, you havent updated your mailing address/address of record to receive a notice), simply check with your states secretary of state office. The specific steps will vary based on your state and the reason why you fell out of compliance. At a high level, youll typically want to: 1. Check why you fell out of compliance in the first place (if you dont already know this, you can check with the states secretary of state office). 2. Submit a reinstatement form on behalf of the corporation or LLC to the secretary of state. You can either do this yourself, or have a legal document filing company handle it for you to make sure youve got all your Ts crossed and Is dotted. In some cases, you may need to file additional documentation with the reinstatement form. It all depends on why you fell out of compliance in the first place. 3. Pay your outstanding fees, fines, and/or overdue state franchise taxes. This is usually the most painful part for any business. Theres typically no easy way around it. If you owe more than you can pay, you may want to consult a lawyer to determine your options. Once youve reinstated your business, your corporation/LLC keeps its original filing date of formation. Im sure that in many cases, it may be tempting to ignore the non-compliant business and start over with a brand new one. However, dont ever think that the state will stop keeping tabs on the old business. Until a business is officially closed with the state, youll be on the hook for all fees, penalties and taxes. As state budgets are being increasingly stretched thin, state franchise and equalization offices are keeping a closer eye on late and non-payments. Reinstating your business lets you instantly regain all the benefits of corporate/LLC status, including that important limited liability protection to safeguard your personal assets. Most importantly, you can start fresh without worrying about an uncertain legal status.","This week, Microsoft announced an expanded beta preview for its popular Office Apps for Android tablets.

In keeping with such updates, Facebook has just begun testing a new feature that would allow businesses to make their online ads shareable on Facebook. on , which played host to a featured partner ad spot for Hidden Valley Ranch. Facebook confirmed that they are testing the new sharing feature, but did not announce how many companies are involved or any other details about the test. If the shareable ads become available to all advertisers, companies that opt in would have the opportunity to purchase ads on other websites that would include a share on Facebook link, which leads users to the companys website. Once on the companys website, users can easily post the ad to their Facebook timeline for their entire social network to see. The new shareable ad feature would be a completely new way for companies who dont already advertise on Facebook to reach a new audience. And the companies that do already advertise on Facebook may be able to reach even more consumers, the thought being that some consumers might be more likely to click an ad if they see that it was shared by one of their friends. Facebook has not released pricing information for the shareable ads yet, as the feature has only been made available to a select group of advertisers. So it remains to be seen if the feature might be feasible for many small businesses. If shareable ads are not made affordable for small business budgets, then the advertising options available on Facebook may become more one-sided in favor of large companies with huge online ad budgets. Facebooks current advertising menu includes features like promoted pages and sponsored stories, which aim to garner more Facebook fans and to have more fans see important posts from a companys Facebook page. The new shareable ads, if Facebook decides to move forward with the idea, wouldnt necessarily have any impact on a companys Facebook page or Facebook fans.

Share Cancel In an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18, Patel said that the pricing pressure in US is cyclical in nature and competition is going to exist in the generic medicine market in US. On the domestic production and business front he said that ten site transfers from the company's Moraiya plant have been completed and the USFDA has been requested to inspect the facility. Below is the verbatim transcript of Pankaj Patel's interview to Ekta Batra on CNBC-TV18. Q: Do you think US Presidential elections may impact Indian pharma? A: One thing is very clear -- as far as Indian companies are concerned, we have a cost advantage. This cost advantage makes us last to live. So even if the situation becomes more competitive, Indian companies would be able to manufacture and able to compete in the US market. Q: Pricing pressure is the other concern that a lot of companies are facing in the US. Are you facing the similar concern? A: Yes, because of the consolidation of the channels, there is definitely pricing pressure and the impact of the consolidation of channels has now been seen by the companies. So, there is a pricing pressure on the US market at this moment. This is a cyclical phase, after every three-four years period, we see pricing pressure coming up and then after the market stabilises and then grows. That has happened in generic -- I call it generic cyclic nature of generic cyclic business and this is what we are seeing that we are at the bottom of the cycle now. We believe that after this bottom, we will stabilise and grow. Q: So it is not going to get worse, there are not going to be more generic companies which are going to be launching the same drugs in the US? A: I think competition is going to be there in generic. If you want to be a generic player and if you expect that there is not going to be a competition, I dont think it is going to be happening. Q: How do you beat pricing pressure on the US to be in the market? A: I think success formula for US business is basically continuous launch of new products and the US customer not only look at price but also look at a good service level. So maintaining a good service levels, supply chain efficiency are very important to become successful in US market. Q: Now talking about the Moraiya facility, 60 percent of sales come from that particular facility, what is the status currently, how many site transfers have you completed? A: We have completed about 10 site transfers but we also have requested FDA to inspect our facility whenever FDA will come, we are confident that we should be able to get approval of Moraiya facility as well. Q: Moraiya has been a bit of a sticky issue in the past as well. Why is that? A: The issue at this time was mainly because of the complaint investigation and a product failure on one of the products. That is the reason why we received this issue. We have been doing something much more than what we should do. As a result, we launched a programme which is known as Quest. It addresses beyond the compliance kind of a situation and our goal is now to move beyond compliance and making sure that we are ahead of others in terms of doing things at our plant so that we always have success. Q: Why the site transfers when you should have the confidence that your facility should get cleared? A: We have the confidence but we realised that Moraiya facility has too much of load and we thought that this would reduces load of manufacturing on Moraiya and get into other facility. As a result, overall the load will get distributed and in the process from a long-term supply planning also it will help us going forward. Q: Do you think there is a systemic issue that Indian pharmaceutical companies face which they might be adapting now when it comes to US FDA? A: It is a part of journey. Every pharmaceutical company has faced problems with FDA at different times. It is an opportunity for you to learn and go ahead. It is not something which one should take as a problem but it should be looked as an opportunity to improve and move forward. If you want to sell into market, the regulator who is responsible for the safety of the patient, they will be extra cautious about it and it is a part of the journey. So, it is kind of a professional hazard. It is going to be there and I dont think we should be too much concerned about it. It might be a temporary problem for companies but it is not a permanent problem. $(""<div class='CL'></div>"").insertAfter("".clear_cls"") Cadila Healthcare Ltd has informed BSE that the me ""The Zydus group will market this therapy through Amerisource Health Services is recalling 2,626 bot The agreement includes early stage development to See all","Companies building customer relationship management and human resources software based on LinkedIns API are upset. Last year, the professional networking giant said it was limiting companies allowed to build hiring, marketing or sales off its API to a few development partners. And that may leave companies like , which builds relationship software using some of LinkedIns data, out in the cold. In particular, the new limitation would likely affect features like , which lets users build and maintain profiles of their most important contacts. But not to worry, the company insists. The new restriction wont hamper development of relationship software too much. And industry observers say the LinkedIn lock out is more likely to encourage those on the outside looking in to build their own solutions instead. In a recent Webinar, Nimble CEO Jon Ferrara explained: Ferrara added that Nimble doesnt duplicate the interface of any other social network anyway. So customers will always have to visit other social sites to drill deeper into contact information. He said customers also always have the option to add their LinkedIn contacts to Nimble themselves. But clearly a major feature of Smart Summary and any similar features is the automatic import and constant update of data on your contacts. And the LinkedIn lock out would clearly seem to have an impact on that.

Or more likely youve heard about the on their plans to begin using drones to deliver packages to your door. Drones are becoming a very hot, and controversial, topic. As technology advances, this once extremely expensive tool that was used primarily by the military is now available to the everyday Joe. But with strong concerns revolving around privacy and the U.S. governments insistence on regulating this new technology, we are left to wonder what role, if any, drones will have in small business, and if they are simply a futuristic dream or a soon to be reality. Lets back up a bit and give those who havent heard anything about drones a bit of information. An (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. Flight of these objects is typically controlled autonomously by onboard computers or by remote control of a user on the ground. Drones come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and while they were typically used in military and special operation applications, they are growing in use in a number of civil applications including firefighting, policing and search and rescue missions. Drone use is preferred in what industry experts refer to as DDD situations: Dull, dirty and dangerous. Domestic drones, although relatively new, are a multi-billion dollar industry and one that is growing rapidly and creating thousands of jobs. We are seeing these devices being used in a number of creative ways by commercial businesses. While some of the examples well share are purely promotional, the fact remains that they may actually be possible as the industry expands and grows. This is probably why Facebook is looking to Titan Aerospace for $60 million dollars to help with an initiative called Internet.org. In keeping with the initiatives goal to bring Internet connectivity to the two-thirds of the worlds population that currently lacks access, solar powered drones would be stationed, like satellites, above these areas to provide an Internet signal. There is an absolute value to these devices and their technology, which will only grow as the technology does and our imaginations allow. Here are some of the unique uses of drones in small business we discovered: Australian textbook company Zookal teamed up with Flirtey, the worlds first autonomous aerial delivery company, to to Australian college students. While this exercise was a bit more about promotion than practicality, due to the cost of running the drone and the capacity of existing battery life, it did display that it is not a far-fetched idea that is very possible as the technology increases in efficiency. In June of 2013, a Dominos pizza franchise in the U.K. revealed of their DomiCopter  a UAV to your door (pictured above). This project, the brainchild of Dominos independent master franchise company in the U.K. and one not being considered in the U.S., demonstrated that food delivery such as this, although a bit promotional, would be very doable in the near future. is a Kickstarter campaign created by Paul Braun of Madison, WI. This project lets kids with autism get a new perspective of the world  from the air  by building their very own hexarotor, flying it and making a film of their journey. As listed on their Kickstarter website: Because many UAVs can be programmed to follow GPS coordinates, drones can serve as the perfect tour guide, directing you to specific points in a specific area. to give students a tour of their complex campus. While personal use of drones in the U.S. is generally allowed, commercial use is restricted by the FAA. There are a couple of major hurdles that well need to overcome before we see generalized use of drones here in the U.S. for commercial applications. The first is the concern of privacy. While there is no doubt that we live in a surveillance society and there are cameras everywhere watching our every move, the introduction of an unknown entity, such as a drone, opens a whole new bag of issues that government regulators need to review. The second is safety and the obvious issues of flying these devices into birds, planes, personal property and people. While other countries, such as Australia and the U.K, have more open acceptance to the use of UAVs with limited regulation, it will be some time before we see regulations allowing the commercial use of drones. As the industry grows, technology expands and more commercial uses of these devices are discovered that will allow for the savings of significant amounts of money for businesses, regulation may well be pushed along to allow for their use. Until that time, well need to keep dreaming about the day our Amazon package drops out of the sky and onto our front doorstep just hours after ordering. And while you may think that the daily use of drones in business is a completely far-fetched Sci-Fi idea that only our great-grandchildren will ever experience, I remind you of another technology that we felt the same way about only 30 years ago: The cell phone. Heres to dreaming, technology and forging our way into the future!","Want to avoid traffic and choose the fastest route? There is an app for that. Looking for a cab or just for a driver to chauffeur you around? There are apps for both. And then there are so many food apps that users are spoilt for choice. Want the best price for all the multiple apps, again there is an app. We are surrounded by apps and there is something for everything. Often times, however, there is the problem of plenty. The number of decisions that a consumer needs to make can get confusing. It is all too much effort to compare rates and quality between apps and their services. Looking at this problem, IIIT- graduates Vennela Miryala, Ravneet Singh and Nikhar Agarwal decided to build Bucker. Bucker acts as a smart-assisting layer for all the different services. Vennela says it helps the consumer reduce the time one spends in searching, comparing and jumping across multiple apps. As college students, the trio were always short of cash. So naturally they were penny wise, and used referrals and fake email accounts to get first-time discounts and everything in between. But they found that it took them a long time to actually get the discount of a few rupees. This is was the prime motivation to set up Bucker. Additionally, they noticed how the older generation always called them to get a recharge done for them, or help them book a bus or cab. It is then the trio realised that while they were savvy with apps, their parents werent so. There are multiple major players trying to solve the same problem, and it makes life complex. The user has to jump across multiple services to figure out where to finally avail what he needs in a cost-effective way. The problem gets much harder when the user has to do this on a tiny mobile screen. We are targeting this exact pain point, says 21-year-old Vennela. Bucker works in the background to identify the user's need for a service, makes queries of all services that can fulfill the need, compares results and provides the best option for the user. All of this is done pro-actively and intelligently so that the user doesn't have to come to Bucker separately. Instead, assistance is provided to him with a simple pop-up.For instance, if the app recognises that the user is looking for a cab, it automatically compares cabs across all major cab service providers, taking into account their offers and surges to give the best possible option. With the product and the model in place, the trio now had to get the partnerships right. With the help of their IIIT network they were able to pitch to the different app players in the field. Bucker follows an affiliate commission revenue model. This means that while it is associated with multiple players in the field, whichever app or service the consumer chooses will pay Bucker. What the current app scenario in India lacks is enough understanding of the user behaviour or preference. There are people who only prefer travelling by Uber and wouldn't travel by Ola or TaxiForSure, irrespective of the price. And then there are college students who need the cheapest possible option. There needs to be different results for such people based on their preferences. We learn the user's patterns based on their app usage. We keep the user in the centre and knit the services around it, adds Vennela. The team claims to have 9,000 users within a span of two months. The app is integrated with over 15 apps, providing assistance across three verticals: cabs, food ordering, and mobile recharge. Bucker recently closed its seed round of funding led by angels from Silicon Valley and 50k Ventures. Its other backers include Munish Jauhar of IAN, Pulkit Jain of Vedantu, Rohit Narang of Singapore-based 314 Capital. On their investment in Bucker, Sanjay Enishetty of 50K Ventures says the passion and skill the founding team displayed got them interested. It's no surprise that there are startups focussed on aggregating the different aggregators in the market. As of 2015, the total number of apps on PlayStore was 1.6 million and in the app store was 1.5 million. According to Mobiforge, by 2017 the worldwide number of app users will approximately touch 4.4. billion, of which 47 per cent will be from Asia Pacific. While Bucker aims to solve a relatively recent problem, its revenues are strongly reliant on other mobile platforms and apps, which have the choice to be part of the platform or not. Most of these players in the three segments that Bucker caters to have deep pockets, and can very easily get the consumer base without having to worry about the leaky bucket. Also, there are players in a similar space: for cab aggregators there is and for those looking for the best value there is . The team says it will restricting itself to segments where the number of players are high, but again only those players that show sustainability will survive the cold winters. So only time will tell how Bucker will evolve and expand its business model.","NEW DELHI: Network today reported a 19 per cent increase in at Rs 233.1 crore for the first quarter ended June.

The Vaio Duo 13 is a tablet with a 13-inch screen. Set it on a flat surface and it transforms from a tablet into a laptop (or all-in-one PC) with a single sliding motion. Its an update to the companys Duo 11 from last year, with a larger screen. It comes in just two colors  what the company calls Carbon Black and Carbon White finishes. As tablets go, Dan Ackerman of CNET pronounces it a little bulky.  That is true. But if you need a tablet to double as a laptop with a physical keyboard so that you get two types of devices in one package, this Vaio Duo 13 could offer a versatile solution. At about three-quarters of an inch thick and weighing under 3 pounds, it still is portable. The Vaio Duo 13 follows the weve been watching avidly. Hybrids seemto resonate with business people. Whether theres enough interest for hybrids to catch on permanently as a device category remains to be seen, however. With the Vaio Duo 13, there is no keyboard dock to attach. Instead the keyboard is concealed under the screen when in tablet configuration, waiting to be slid in place when needed. Remembering your keyboard is one less thing to think about for entrepreneurs or other mobile professionals when carrying your tablet with you. Business users will also appreciate that it runs Windows 8. It boasts a 10+ hour battery life. Heres another feature business users may appreciate: like other tablets, the Vaio Duo 13 has a rear camera for taking vivid photos. But that the devices image capture software can also double as a scanner for documents. Take a photo of a document and then use the Vaio Duo 13s imaging software to straighten it out like a scanned document. Optical character recognition software can even recognize the text from the scanned item. You can also write on the screen with a stylus, so you can take notes while using it as a tablet. Another cool feature is a so-called constant connection which means that, like smartphones, the computer stays connected to the Internet downloading emails and updating applications even while in sleep mode. In his review (video below), Ackerman also praises the easy-to-use keyboard and even the narrow but functional touchpad mouse (its better than not having one). However, he points out that the slant of the screen when the device is in laptop configuration, cannot be adjusted and may not be for everyone. The Vaio Duo 13 just went on sale in the U.S. and it is pricey at $1,399. However, the device features the new Intel Haswell-based microprocessor, giving it considerable functionality, .","I ran across this study released in July that said that about . The root of the distrust comes from the perception that marketing is disconnected from ROI and that they are more focused on building brands on social media than getting and keeping profitable customers. The results of this study didnt surprise me  call me cynical, but thats been my experience in the corporate environment; CEOs not understanding the marketing process, and marketers who were more enamored with fancy creative campaigns than the fundamentals of differentiation, positioning and conversions. When I received my review copy of by Ric Dragon, CEO of DragonSearch, I didnt know what to expect. Would this be a book that would take our understanding and management of social media to a more functional and practical level? After spending a Saturday morning highlighting text and dog-earring pages, I would say, Yes! Marketing savvy small business owners, marketing managers, product managers and social media managers in larger organizations will appreciate this book because it bridges the gap between the profit-oriented C-Suite and the brand building, social-centered marketing teams. will give each side of the organization a playing field where they can come together to use social media to achieve both their marketing and financial goals. One of the fundamental ways the bridges the perceived profitability gap between marketers and CEOs is by harnessing the history of social media, the measurement and analytical tools that are available and then building a process around these so that marketers can achieve their goals and CEOs can see the connection between social media campaigns and activities and profitability. Ric Dragon introduces a social media process that businesses and brands of any size can use to achieve their marketing goals. Here is just a summary of the process as its introduced at the beginning of the book: One of the key drivers of the book and the process is to help businesses and social media managers adapt to whatever new social media channels come up. So instead of simply focusing on a specific channel such as Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn, by learning to use this process, you will be prepared for any new channel thats likely to come up in the future and quickly evaluate it and add it to your strategy. I wonder if this book could only have been written by anyone other than a CEO, who has experience on both the executive and the marketing social media side of the spectrum? Ric Dragon has extensive experience on both sides. He has 16 years of experience in online marketing and software development. He is co-founder of the software and web development company Oxclove Workshop. Dragon is the cofounder and CEO of DragonSearch, where he has led social media strategy for brands such as Steuben, The Grammy Foundation and Raritan as well as several others. Its his balanced experience that allows him to create a social media strategy and process that anyone will be able to create and use inside their business. This is a book that is ideal for any business owner who is looking for ways to tie their social media marketing to ROI (return-on-investment). Inside, youll find examples of spreadsheets and project management checklists that will help you overcome the overwhelm that comes with trying to figure out how to focus your social media marketing.","Endless articles are posted in business publications about customer servicesolutions. Knowing how to best connect with your customers is an important part of being successful in the long term, as well as achieving growth that keeps you going in the meantime. With so much information out there, you would think that we would have the process down to an art. But all it takes is a trip through Yelp, or Googling large companies like Xfinity to see that customer satisfaction is far from being mastered. As a smaller brand, you have a distinct advantage in your ability to directly communicate with and connect with your audience. You can also get a bit more creative with your attempts and act more efficiently. So, what does it take? Simple, but crucial. In a time when there are dozens of customer support solutions to choose from, you should take the time to really find one that will work for you and your team. Check out features versus price, and any special offers they might have. Most importantly, contact them with questions. The way a customer support services handles customer support themselves should give you a clear indication of how good their tool really is. I am using to power my customer service emails. I have found it to be a simple, yet complete solution. As a business owner or a manager, you should always be on top of how your customer service team performs. Keeping an eye on customer satisfaction is a key to your business success! I use , the multi-purpose business dashboard, to keep analyzing how we are doing. I have enabled ZenDesk widget inside my Customer satisfaction dashboard to monitor if we are suddenly seeing a spike in customer service tickets, how quickly those tickets are closed, etc. I also annotate campaign dates, holidays, etc. (anything that can affect our customer service team) to see what might have caused each spike. Using Cyfe, you can simply add another widget for notes as well as the calendar widget to monitor important dates. You should begin building a foundation of understanding with your customers as soon as you can. Of course, you likely dont have the budget of big companies for data mining and acquisition. You will need to be a bit more creative with the process. A personal favorite method of mine is to create surveys. Depending on your needs, you can make either a longer one that is done all at once, or you can offer randomized questions on the site itself that show up and change each time a user visits. You can find a great deal of information this way, granted that there is some kind of login or account connection. Once you have information on their needs, interests, or complaints, you can make a note on the account. Now, you have that information every time they contact you. is one of the coolest survey solutions Ive seen so far: You can create mini-surveys for different landing pages of your site and engage visitors depending on their intent. They also have cool analytics to help you understand your visitors better: Most people will go to any length to avoid a phone call with a customer support agent. Admit it, you will yourself. That is why companies began offering alternative methods for contact, including email, social media support, and chat support. You dont have to provide all of them (spreading yourself too thin is a cardinal sin for small businesses). But you should have at least one alternative avenue for users who would prefer not to contact you by phone. If you are looking for affordable solution here, look no further. is free and its incredibly easy to install (so no development costs either). It will provide you will essential online chat features and even analytics: Going back to knowing your audience, another benefit of having that information is the ability to customize gifts. People love free stuff. they love feeling like you appreciate them, and that you are not just taking, taking, taking. When you also show that you know them, you are going to get better results. Perhaps my favorite example of this in practice is the . They took influencers they wanted to target, and made those women customized gifts sent to their homes. Each gift was created using images they had pinned on their Pinterest boards. They sent out 50 gifts across the world, and as a result ended up with an astonishing 694,853 total impressions. Your employees need to be trained in customer service, obviously. You have probably hired some people to handle help desk, as well. But that doesnt mean you shouldnt be directly involved with the process. Recently, I emailed a website that offers a video call streaming dashboard, to ask about features. The CEO contacted me back and scheduled a meeting, bypassing any customer service steps in between. He spent an hour and a half speaking to me, and offered to create a customized version of the platform that would meet my needs. This is not an unusual occurrence, by a long shot. Startups are taking customer service to a new level, and the top dogs are frequently involved. A good email marketing strategy is the key here:Getting in touch with your customers when you really have something exciting to share always works wonders. Make sure to use email marketing segmentation: If there are some customers more likely to need/want it, you should target them first. That way they both feel special, and you are informing them before they have to contact you for details. Getresponse offers the Ive ever seen: Really easy to manage! A shocking number of companies are just doing social media all wrong, especially small businesses. They use their profiles as some kind of advertising dumping ground. You can see that they have clearly read a bunch of blog posts telling them the perfect formula for growing their social media presence. As a result, it comes off as insincere, pandering, and marketing jargon. Skip all that and instead, use social media to directly engage and communicate with your audience on a one on one level. Track down and add your customers, or add them back when they follow you. Contact them with special offers. Respond to their tweetsandcomments. Use your profiles to have a conversation, not to sell. Never forget that social media is not a place for conversions, but lead generation through connection. Related: Be different! A unique customer service experience can be your strongest competitor advantage and word-of-mouth marketing catalyst! shared her own examples with me: Years ago she and her husband owned a domain registration service and their big thing was one-hour reply. I can see how this can empower your site call-to-action and increase your site trust: A one-hour reply policy to all the support tickets. Wow! Gamification is another possible way to let your customer service go viral. is quite possibly a pioneer in this field allowing businesses to make customer service experience actually fun and activating: Heres a explaining the process. Your site content should answer all your customers possible questions. Helping your customers is the smartest content marketing strategy. One of the best examples of that implemented well is . They create a lot of for their customer base. In this case, were talking about companies in retail. They generated an infographic, they constantly update their blogs with relevant information on how to use the Microsoft products, webinars, white papers (because in the corporate andretail world, you need numbers to prove the value of a business), podcasts, YouTube videos, etc. Its more like a B2B customer service solution, because theyre making their customers feel comfortable with the software they sell, and believe that Knowledge is power. So, this is their creative way: offering knowledge, under many forms, so that their clients are always informed, are getting familiar and are returning to their websites. When people ask me what the most important thing they can do to become a better marketer is, I always tell them to read Dale Carnegies,  . Originally published in 1936, it is still the greatest work on marketing out there. He doesnt give you magic bullet tricks to manipulate customers. He teaches the importance of empathy, compassion, and connection. He brings it all back to basics. Last but not least, remember the saying The customer is always right? Well, if youve been providing services for a couple of years, youll know thats not exactly true. Whatever happens, always remember to remain a professional. Read for some inspiration. Do you have a tip for customer service solutions?","Big business now employs the majority of private sector workers.Small businesss share of private sector employment has fallen from 54.8 percent in 1987 to 49.2 percent in 2011. This shift has occurred largely because big business has gotten better at preserving jobs. The figure above uses Census Bureau data to calculate the small business fraction of employment over time. As you can see, with the exception of the 2001 to 2004 period, small businesss share of employment has been trending downward it peaked in 1987. Employment is the result of both job creation and job destruction. When firms are started or grow, they often create jobs. When companies shut down or shrink, they often destroy jobs. Employment rises if job creation is larger than job destruction, and falls if job destruction exceeds job creation. A good analogy is the level of water in a sink. Job creation is like the water coming out of the faucet, job destruction is akin to water going down the drain, and employment is similar to the water level. If job creation is higher than job destruction  more water comes out of the faucet than goes down the drain  employment rises. If job destruction is higher than job creation  more water goes down the drain than comes out of the faucet  employment falls. Now think of large and small firm employment like double sinks in a fancy bathroom. Big business is the one with the faster rising water level. According to Census Bureau data, between 1977 and 2011, employment at businesses with fewer than 500 employees increased 60.2 percent. But at businesses with 500 or more employees, employment increased 80.7 percent. The difference in the rate of employment growth at big and small businesses explains why small business accounts for a smaller share of the labor force in 2011 (49.2 percent) than it did in 1977 (52.2 percent). But whats driving relatively higher employment growth at big companies? A large decline in big company job destruction. Census data show that both big and small firms created fewer jobs in 2011 than in 1977  the number created at small firms declined by 4 percent, while the number created at large firms dropped by 11 percent. Both big and small firms also got better at job retention. However, big companies improved by far more, reducing their job destruction by 43 percent, as compared to 24 percent at companies with fewer than 500 workers. Small businesss share of employment has declined over the past three-and-a-half decades for a good reason. Big business has reduced substantially the number of jobs it destroys through layoffs and firm closures. As a result, big company employment has risen faster than small company employment.","If youre an online entrepreneur, there are few things more important than the security of your domain names. Building an audience and marketing your website depends upon the security of these names and of the passwords that protect them. It also depends upon the password security of other accounts you use in your business. So imagine how it might feel to suddenly discover that the domain names to two of your most valuable sites are suddenly gone! Its your worst nightmare. On Wednesday of last week, blogger and online entrepreneur Hesham Zebida says he discovered, to his dismay, that two of his most valuable domain names (including FamousBloggers.net) had been mysteriously transferred from his Web hosting account. He says he then received an e-mail from someone claiming to have the domains and offering to sell them back. . After contacting his hosting company, Zebida spent the next four days doing what many of us might, contacting everyone imaginable including law enforcement and his connections in the online blogging community, working to get his domains back. He finally succeeded, but admits he didnt get much sleep in the process. Heres what we can all take from his ordeal. . Zebida blames his hosting company for allowing his domains to disappear in the first place and for not working hard enough to resolve the problem on his behalf, but the fact is that hosting companies regularly post warnings like this one. It is every website owners responsibility to do what they can to secure their site, as Zebida says he now realizes. . If you want to go the extra mile and avoid issues with your domain names and other online security problems, webmaster Mitz Pantic has some suggestions for you. Dont rely on your hosting company alone to protect your site and domain names. Take the time to learn whats necessary to protect your online business from harm. . You may believe that only big companies need to deal with attacks on their websites and that small businesses are too far under the radar to draw the attention of attackers. Youre wrong. In a recent Twitter chat with representatives from online security provider Symantec, members of our community learned the threat is real. Protecting your Website. Of course, as blogger and online entrepreneur Scott Dudley reminds us, its not just your domain name thats vulnerable to attack. The content management software you use to create your Website may also allow unwanted access, resulting in lost visibility and lost business. Take steps to protect your site. . New developments in Web standards may bring even more security challenges in the not-too-distant future. For example, new tools known collectively as HTML5 could make your humble website as sophisticated and powerful as desktop software, but resulting security risks may give any webmaster pause.","Voicemail, you probably have a love-hate relationship with this technology, especially if a caller blocks his or her ID and you dont know who it is. But, it is a useful tool and companies have been trying to improve how customers use voicemail by bringing it into the 21stcentury. The latest company to make the attempt is Apple. The tech giant will be to transcribe your voicemail messages so you can read instead of listen to them. So, what is the difference between listening and reading your voicemail? According to Business Insider, which the news, its a productivity and generational thing. From a productivity standpoint, it takes much less time to read an email of a transcribed voicemail message than to listen to the recorded message itself. From a generational standpoint, older users prefer listening to voicemail, while younger users dont. Called iCloud Voicemail, the new service will use Siri to answer your call if you are not able to talk. The recorded message is sent to Apples servers and it is converted to text, which will be promptly sent to your iPhone in an email. As the computing power of mobile devices continues to increase and 4G LTE networks finalize their deployments, voice services of all kinds via smartphone are likely to become more and more effective. For Apple, iCloud Voicemail transcriptionis an attempt to improve Siris capabilities. The reason for that may be driven by Microsofts Cortana, now available in Windows 10, and Google Now. Both companies have integrated innovative voice technology to anticipate users needs and to make recommendations and/or answer their queries through voice. The new iCloud Voicemail is scheduled to be released in 2016, but dont get your hopes up yet. Google Voice, launched back in 2009, has had a similar service for years now, but the technology has sometimes left much to be desired. In this comical experiment conducted by deputy technology news editor of the New York Times David F. Gallagher, Google Voice the sky as this guy, Google as cool and Louisville, Kentucky as louise open tacky. Obviously, Apple will try to do better.","Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours.

We know the benefits and value of networking with people in person, but some compelling trends and statistics emerged in 2012that were shared in an infographic titled,   created by Creotivo: My recent relocation to the Tampa Bay area had many moving parts. Since I was familiar with the area and knew people in business, I decided to network people instead of events, feeling thatthey would naturally lead me to others. And this approach is working. I not only picked up the phone, but used LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter prior to moving to connect with people and ask if they could make some introductions for me. Once I was moved, I joined a chamber, a business networking group, an arts facility and the local cycling club. I put these communities in place so I could meet a diverse mix of local people who share many of my interests. A question that comes up often is,  ? When it does, I lead with my career story, which allows me to be more personal with people. The story of your story is a great connector. Locally as well as far and wide, it allows us to find and build communities of like minded and spirited people fairly quickly. Less is actually more. A smaller group of more targeted connections is far more valuable than a huge group of followers who are really just numbers on a list. The best way of determining what medias are right for you is to observe what others are doing who are engaging you. Ask, survey and tap your community to find out what is working best for them. LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter are my big three. But use what works for you, your business, your customers and your industry. We all have something to offer and we should be sharing it often and freely. This is the best way to educate people about who we are, what we do and how we can solve problems. People drive their businesses today so getting out front via content marketing is not a bad thing or an ego thing as long the intent is to serve others and not always be selling. Celebrate results, the impact of what you do, what you have learned and how it has and can benefit others. When you market the results up front not the product or service, it demonstrates how you solve problems. That, ultimately, is your best sales story. This can yield big dividends. Networking has always had a prominence in growing personal and professional connections and reputation. Interacting, connecting and gathering socially in person is the most natural thing we do. Networking in person always takes priority, but your online communication platforms support, solidify and grow your relationships in between those times. In person and online networking are now interdependent and mutually beneficial. Finding that perfect mix of media, marketing and mingling is how we make ourselves stand out, claim our space and build loyal communities and customers. These are great reminders of just how easy this can be. What influences your best mix of media, personal marketing and mingling?","Daniel Goodman Business Insider is looking for a paid intern to join our growing video team this fall.

There are new features youll find with the Shopping Campaigns that are meant to help you manage your campaigns at scale. According to the announcement, these campaigns have received great feedback so far. Shopping campaigns have actually been available for advertisers since February of this year, so for many the transition wont be too overwhelming. You have quite a bit of time to get accustomed to the new types of campaigns. If youre an advertiser already running a regular PLA campaign, you can choose to either replace all of these campaigns with Shopping Campaigns right away, or you can slowly move over your campaigns one by one. Nevertheless, the sooner you can learn about the benefits and how it all works, the better forward you can move your AdWords campaign and get ready for the big August switch. As discussed above and in the announcement, Shopping Campaigns were introduced in February of this year and offered: The latest features of the new Shopping Campaigns include: The above three features are new to Shopping Campaigns, but many of the other benefits still remain true. You still get powerful reporting that allows you to see how your products are performing at any level (no new product groups needed), competitive data and advanced optimization (using the bid simulator tool), and retail-centric campaign management (browse your product inventory directly in AdWords). Although you have until August to use your PLAs, its important to start familiarizing yourself with some of the things that are different about the Shopping Campaigns. A few of these differences include: In the past with regular PLAs you would need to manually create and manage each of your product targets. With Shopping Campaigns, all of your product data is accessible within AdWords. These campaigns are powered by your Merchant Center product data, but you can browse and organize your product inventory without having to reference your Merchant Center product data. Shopping Campaigns use Custom Labels instead of AdWords labels or grouping. Custom Labels helps you subdivide your products in a campaign. You can create up to five custom labels for every product. Until August, if youre still using PLA campaigns you shouldnt replace your AdWords Labels with Custom labels in your product feed because it could affect your performance. In the end, its really the way you manage and monitor your campaigns that has changed. So what hasnt changed? What the new Shopping Campaigns offer users and potential customers is just the same as with the old PLAs. The ads will still appear in the same places on the Web and on the same networks, so the need for these campaigns hasnt changed. Google has been publishing quite a few different options for those of you who are still unfamiliar and want to learn more. Some resources that may help you: So what does this all mean to you? In the end, its important to understand how Shopping Campaigns work and the benefits they can offer because come August, these will be your only option. I think youll find that they arent too different than your regular PLAs. But its still important to become familiar with some of your options so that you can move your AdWords efforts forward over the next year and beyond. Are you familiar with Shopping Campaigns in AdWords? Let us know about your experience and what you think about Google retiring PLAs ads.","If you have a version of Sonys VAIO Fit 11A/Flip PC, stop using it now.

The VAIO Fit 11A/Flip PC was released in February. The voluntary action requested by Sony comes after the company says it discovered some of the batteries were prone to overheat. Sony says that a total of 368 units are affected. Sony is in the process of contacting more than 25,000 customers who bought the device, to The Verge. The VAIO Fit 11A/Flip PC is known as the little brother of Sonys larger VAIO Fit convertible laptop.

Right now, we are in the midst of a growth spurt that will see mobile payments in the U.S. hit $90 billion by 2017, according to a Forrester Research report released earlier this year. Thats up from $12.8 billion spent in 2012, the report states. Its also easier than ever to join the party, and retailers have an almost overwhelming number of options. There are several companies that cater to each type of mobile payment. Some companies (like Square) you are likely familiar with, but there are new faces popping up all the time. It pays to check with your bank or merchant service provider to see what they have to offer. Organizations, like , also have in order to help businesses understand this growing and rapidly changing method of payment. To help you find the best fit for your business, here are a few things to consider when choosing your mobile payment processor: If you are not ready to let go of swiping a physical credit or debit card, there are a number of companies that allow you to use a card reader inserted right into your smartphone or tablet, including: If youre looking for something that doesnt necessarily require a card, you have options there as well: allows customers to present a QR code (linked to their credit or debit card) from their smartphones for payment. The retailer then uses a LevelUp terminal to scan the code to complete the transaction. Similarly, and use near field communication (NFC) technology to accept payments. Customers with NFC-enabled smartphones just tap or hover their phone over the terminal to make a payment. Both PayPass and payWave accept NFC-enabled credit cards as well, and PayPass also accepts payments from . Transaction fees for mobile payments are relatively cheap and simple to understand. Many companies advertise a flat rate per transaction with no hidden fees or monthly charges, but most also charge a higher rate for cards that are manually entered or keyed in. Advertised fees typically hover around 2 to 3% of the total payment per swipe. Groupons Breadcrumb is on the low end of that range, advertising 1.8% plus $0.15 per swipe, while Square and GoPayment advertise 2.75% per swipe. Some companies offer a lower per-swipe rate for an additional monthly fee. For example, GoPayment offers an option to pay $12.95 per month for a 1.75% per swipe fee. LevelUp is unique in offering completely free credit card processing if you participate in their Interchange Zero program. The program requires you to run a marketing campaign with LevelUp and for every dollar your customer spends as a result of that campaign, $0.40 goes to LevelUp.

Once you get over the initial excitement, its time to break down the process of launching your startup into manageable chunks. You might get overwhelmed with the sheer number of items on your to-do list. But not to worry; Ive broken down this startup checklist into the primary tasks you need to do now, and those that you can defer until later. Do the following tasks either before launch or during the early days of your startup. Be brutally honest. Your startup needs to be something you can make a profit doing or delivering. Ask yourself: would you buy it? Run the numbers: will customers pay enough so that you can cover costs and make a profit?  Here is a list of , attributed to noted investor Paul Graham. Its easy to convince yourself that you dont need a business plan, but creating a business plan with financial projections forces you to think through details. Keep your plan a living breathing thing that you revisit and adapt regularly. Most startups take a lot more time to get off the ground than you expect. Know where your living expenses for the first year will come from (savings, a job, spouses income, etc.). If you need financing for the business start investigating as soon as possible. Spend time to make sure your spouse and other close family buy into your startup. Youll have enough challenges without resistance from family. You want a name that will stick in your target audiences heads. And it shouldnt already be taken by another company. Do Google searches and use a corporate name search tool to see if the name you have in mind is unique. Check at the state and Federal level. Get a matching domain to your business name. An AOL email address or a website with free hosting and a name like mysite.wordpress.com makes it seem like either (a) you are not running a real business or (b) you dont plan to be around long. can protect your personal assets. Talk over structure (corporation, LLC, sole proprietorship) with your attorney and accountant. An Employer Identification Number (EIN) helps you separate yourself from your business. Youll need it if you plan to incorporate your business or open a business bank account. Plus, with it you can avoid giving out your social security number (an opening to identity theft). . You may need one, if not several, business licenses for your startup, depending on your industry and where you are located. Most licenses are at the state or local level. Here in the United States, . Get your website up and running as soon as possible. Today, its necessary for credibility. Even if your product is not yet built, you can start with company information. Getting set up on the major social media channels (Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, to start) will make marketing on them later easier. Also, its important to reserve your brand as a profile name. Try to reserve the names. Start generating revenue as soon as possible. At the early stages of a startup there is never enough money  resist the temptation to wait until things are perfect. Oh, and get your lawyer to create any customer contract forms necessary. If youve got a brick-and-mortar business, youll need to sort this out early. If you plan to run a retail business, pay attention to foot traffic, accessibility, and other factors that will affect the number of people that will walk in your store. EXCEPTION: If you dont have a brick and mortar or retail business, then hold off renting an office as long as possible to avoid saddling your startup with lease payments. As a startup founder, youll be doing a lot of networking, so order plenty of business cards. They are inexpensive enough that you can reorder them later if things change. Without cards you lack credibility. Its all too easy to use your personal bank account to pay for business expenses, but it becomes a gnarl to untangle later. Once you have your bank account set up, choose an accounting program. Start as you intend to go.Few things will doom your business faster than books that are a mess. If you have one or more founders, its imperative that you decide who will do what up front. Put it in writing. Co-founder disagreements can destroy your business. While you dont want to put off these tasks too long, they dont need to be checked off your list before you launch. As an entrepreneur you are going to be on the go  a lot. I cant emphasize enough how useful a good phone with good business apps can be, in running your startup. Get a credit card swipe device to accept payments, too. Your local SBA office, SCORE, and other small business resources can provide you with free advice, access to business templates, and other tools. Depending on the type of business youre starting, you may need insurance of one kind or another, like liability, workers comp, or health insurance, especially if you hire full-time staff. Depending on the type of business you have, you may need staff from day one (retail) or you may be able to outsource to freelancers, interns, and third-party vendors for a while (service and tech businesses).  Just remember, trying to do everything yourself takes you away from growing the business. Finding a good source of inventory is crucial, especially in certain types of businesses (retail, manufacturing). Beyond inventory, line up good reliable suppliers and service providers so you dont have to sweat the details. The best thing to do is consult an attorney early about the need for patents, especially. Get the advice early. Then you may be able to defer filing for a while, depending on the nature of your business. Reach out to former co-workers and colleagues, as well as friends and family. Dont pressure them to buy your products or services. Instead, tap into them for introductions and help with other things on this startup checklist. Be careful about wasting time on business partnership discussions. Your business wont be attractive to potential partners unless and until you start making headway. Focus your precious time to make sales and get customers. You need a good elevator pitch for many reasons: potential investors, customers, prospective new hires, bankers. If you cant persuasively and clearly pitch your business, how can you expect key stakeholders to buy in? As you go along you will learn more about the marketplace. Use customer feedback to refine your product and service offerings, and your go-to-market approach. Whether youre running a tech company or not, you likely have sensitive data on computers and devices that you want protected. Protect it from intrusions and disasters. Back it up! IT problems can derail a fledgling company. In many startups the business owner starts out as the chief sales person. But to grow you need a dedicated sales function, so you can focus on activities other than day-to-day sales. Its all to easy easy to work in your business rather than on it. As Michael Gerber tells us in we need to be working on our businesses if we want them to grow and flourish. A mentor who has succeeded in your industry can provide you with priceless advice and serve as a sounding board. Your checklist might be longer than this, but organizing what needs to be done before you launch and what you can take care of down the road makes it easier to prioritize your tasks.","Cloud accounting software company Intacct has just raised $45 million.

Langone started brewing while attending college in Syracuse, N.Y. Back then he was studying to become an architect, and didnt expect to make brewing into a career. Langone was frustrated with the lack of decent home brewing supplies available. He would end up storing the large bucket and other supplies in his closet or basement instead of the kitchen. As a result, he would not brew very often. So he used his knowledge of design, brewing, and woodworking to create something new  the HopBox (pictured above). In an interview with author and infomercial personality Matthew Lesko he : HopBox now offers various home-brewing kits and supplies handmade from rustic pine. The kits are intended to scale for various sized kitchens in homes and apartments and add an element of style beyond the basic kits available from other retailers. Langone to Kickstarter to fund the launch of HopBox. He completed a successful fundraising campaign at the end of May. The kits are currently available for pre-sale and are scheduled to begin shipping in July. Langone is also now in business with lifelong friend Matt Gorman, who he introduced to brewing a couple of years ago. The pair hopes give even more people the satisfaction they say comes with home brewing using their stylized kits and supplies. On the HopBox website Langone :","Franchised businesses performed relatively well during the Great Recession and weak economy recovery that followed. According to data provided in the prepared by IHS Global Insight for the International Franchise Association Educational Foundation, the number of franchised establishments declined 3.1 percent; the number of employees at franchised outlets fell 2.4 percent; and the inflation-adjusted dollar value of output dropped 2.2 percent between 2007 and 2009. These numbers are relatively modest in comparison to what happened to the economy as a whole. Moreover, franchised businesses have rebounded relatively strongly since 2009. While the number of franchised establishments declined an additional 1.5 percent from 2009 to 2011, employment at franchised outlets grew by 1.7 percent. Moreover, the inflation-adjusted value of output increased 3.6 percent over the two-year period. Efficiency is higher now than before the recession. By shrinking the number of outlets, and increasing employment at the locations that remained, owners have improved both output per outlet and output per worker. Output per establishment increased 6.1 percent in real terms from 2007 to 2011  up from an average of $969,000 to $1,028,000 in 2012 dollars. Output per worker rose 2.1 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars, increasing from $93,400 to $95,400.","If you havent heard yet, Vine is now and in total Twitter shares, reports MarketingLand. Vine is an app that lets you creates 6-second videos. The apps description invites you to Create short, beautiful, looping videos in a simple and fun way for your friends and family to see. You then can load your Vine videos on to Twitter or other social accounts. Vine was previously available only to Apple mobile device users (iPhone, iPad etc.), where it was downloaded by 13 million people and became so popular that Twitter acquired it in October 2012. According to Twitter, 12 million Vine videos are posted to the microblogging site daily. Some might doubt the marketing power of a video that lasts only seconds. But the same doubts might have been raised about photo sharing app Instagram a year ago before Facebook paid a billion dollars for it.  Here are some tips from the community for marketing using Vine videos. Vine provides an easy way to create animation on a mobile device. By stopping and starting the video while recording, you can make creative animated videos like Lowes video of ants invading a sandbox and Urban Outfitters dancing sneakers, writes blogger Julie Blakely. With the perceived short attention span of the younger generation, ages 18 to 24, and the busyness of the average Web surfer or mobile user, Vine is seen as an ideal way to tell your companys story these days. Analytics specialist Bridget Kelly introduces us to the 6 second history of denim at The Gap or a six second love story between a pineapple and a bottle of Malibu Rum. Theres no reason to stop with just making your own Vine video clips either. In this post, Megan Totka, chief editor for ChamberofCommerce.com suggests the ease of use of the Vine app makes it perfect for encouraging fans of your business or brand to get creative too. For example, create a contest for your customers to send in a video using your product in imaginative ways and give prizes to the winners. Just because a Vine video is incredibly easy to make and is only six seconds long, doesnt mean it shouldnt be planned out, says Mark Donington, Lead Designer of Higher Ground Creative. Donington suggests starting with a narrative and planning what you want to say before you start recording. It might sound strange to think about a video this way. But just as an elevator pitch forces you to share your business idea in less time than it takes to reach the executive suite, a short video requires focus. Think about what you could do to demonstrate the greatness of your product in 6 seconds or less. Six seconds may be too little time for a lengthy marketing message, but its enough time to create a lasting impression with a truly creative video. Think about a way you could use those six seconds to create a memorable impression of your brand with a story or series of images customers will never forget. Here are 15 real world examples from branding expert Hannah Fleishman. Focus on the visual elements of your brand. This could be easier for some businesses than for others. For example, later this month 20th Century Fox released the highly anticipated film The Wolverine starring Hugh Jackman, and two months ago issued a Vine teaser of the new film, generating buzz. Your business may not be as visually stunning as a Hollywood blockbuster, but look for ways to tell your story in an exciting and visual way. Vine may be a new marketing tool, but in the end, its not so different from other tools that have come before. Though blogger Clyde Smith is talking specifically about how musicians can use Vine to market their work online, the principles are the same. Consider what techniques have worked in previous online video platforms like YouTube and dont forget to be creative. Yes, Vine is an app allowing you to easily create six-second videos. But it is also one of a new breed of social media tools acquired by Twitter and similar to other social tools like Instagram. When shared via Twitter or on other sites, Vine can be a powerful way to engage with your customers. Kristi Hines gives you some ideas on how to do it. You can use Vine to market your brand or business in so many ways. From giving customers a look behind the scenes in your business to giving a preview of new products to heighten anticipation. Remember, though, that like any marketing campaign, youll want a strategy in place first to make your efforts more effective.","What type of customer service benchmarks should your eCommerce business be hitting? The E-Tailing Groups 17th Annual Mystery has some insights. The survey, conducted at the end of 2014, studied 100 top retail websites for their best practices. When it comes to eCommerce customer service, these are the benchmarks used and how you can incorporate them in your business: Of the 100 retailers surveyed, 83 percent have FAQs on-site. However, only 26 percent offer the ability to search FAQs. Surprisingly, the percentage of sites that list customer service hours of operation dropped from 83 percent in 2013 to 77 percent in 2014. This is the type of basic information every business should include on its website. Top-rated retailers enable customers to checkout with five or fewer total steps/screens to fill out. Nearly all of the retailers (98 percent) now offer the ability to pre-populate the customer profile in the shopping cart so shoppers can check out faster. In addition, half have enabled one-click checkout. As more consumers are browsing and buying on different devices, the universal shopping cart (which can be accessed from any device) is now offered by 82 percent of the top retailers, up from 73 percent in 2013. Another desirable feature: 65 percent of top retailers allow shoppers to move items from the shopping cart to a wish list or buy later list, up from 54 percent in 2013. Top retailers in the survey average delivery in 3.42 days, a slight improvement over 3.8 days in 2013. Some 81 percent of eTailers include customer service phone numbers in their order confirmation emails, up from 77 percent in 2013. The top retailers not only answer email questions within 24 hours, but also include a personalized salutation and content. Two-thirds of retailers now have one, uniform return policy for both online and offline purchases. Retailers are also adding convenience to the online return process by providing prepaid return shipping labels  64 percent of sites provide these, up from 59 percent in 2013. By monitoring these eCommerce customer service benchmarks and continually seeking to improve upon them, your business can reach new levels of customer service success.","Think of internet companies. Now think of the number of these companies and their services that you use on a daily basis. Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora, Wikipedia would generally pop up in your head. There is a treasure trove of information available to us, almost instantly these days. Apart from access to this information, one can set up a website for free on WordPress or blogger, download free mobile apps on iTunes and Google Play Store, watch videos for free on YouTube, and post free classified ads on sites like Quikr and Craigslist. While some of these services come for free, it is no secret that most of them are turning huge profits. But where does this money come from? Advertising comes to the mind immediately when you think of revenue models. And yes, advertising is the major revenue source for many of them. But there are several other models as well. Here we have compiled a comprehensive list of all these revenue models just for you. One of the oldest money-making sources, this model is under constant evolution. With the general internet population having access to ad-blocking tools, the industry has gone on to employ complex and creative methods to stay relevant. 2. Freemium model Perhaps the most common model used by Web services. The idea here is to sell a basic free product to as many customers as possible, but keep the premium features exclusively for paying customers. A large number of SaaS products use this model. For instance, Dropbox offers 2GB of free cloud data storage. But if one wants more space, one has to pay up. Other examples include Adobe Flash, Evernote, Google Docs/Drive, LinkedIn, Prezi, Slideshare, Skype, WordPress, and many mobile games like Farmville, Angry Birds etc. The traditional world of retail comprising of malls and high street stores changed forever in the 90s when companies likeAmazonemerged. Because they could save on expensive real estate costs, the prices offered on these stores were significantly lower. Selling through e-commerce can include:  Mostly followed by high-traffic blogs, this is a model wherein the publisher signs up for affiliate programs related to their service/content and convert their users to customers of their affiliates/advertisers. In most cases this involves a publisher earning a commission when a user follows a link on their blog to another site and this converts into the user buying something at the affiliate site. A recent example is several well-known bloggers pushing out MotoG reviews and then linking to the Flipkart exclusive sale site for commissions. Newspapers, Gym, Magazines  yes, all of them use a subscription model. So, it has been existent since long. In the digital domain, software, which was once dominated by the licensing model, is slowly moving towards a subscription model. Generally, unlimited usage is offered, but a few have a specified cap above which they charge a higher rate. The different sub-models are: Very common among software companies, this model is however losing its sheen due to the Licensing could be for usage, which is the model for Intellectual Property (patents, copyrights, trademarks). This type of license is usually limited by time, territory, types of products, volume, etc. The other kind is for certification, like theMcAfee SECURE trustmarks used for Internet websites. Have you heard the phrase, If you are not paying for the product, you are not the customer, you are the product being sold. High-quality, exclusive data is very valuable in the digital age. Many companies specialize in lead generation of potential customers and sell them to thirdparties. You dont pay for services like Google, Twitter and Facebook. But they aggregate high quantities of data about you and several millions like you and show you contextual advertisements based on this data. Which is why you are not the customer, you are the product being sold. Many services are sponsored by government organizations and major funds if it directly helps them or the world at large, for example, Khan Academy is funded by the Gates Foundation and Google. Then there is the Wikipedia model where the users are asked to willingly donate small to large amounts of donation to help support the initiative. Many browser extensions and WordPress plugins etc. also follow this route. This might be counterintuitive and not the best of revenue models because there is no revenue involved. But many companies have built traction over time and never worried about how they are going to make money, and have finally sold for big bucks to the internet giants, for example, Instagram, Pinterest.","Capital investment activity at non-corporate businesses has been declining for the past decade, data from the Federal Reserves report shows. Between 2000 and 2011, the latest year data are available, the average non-corporate non-financial business reduced its gross fixed capital formation by one-third, when measured in inflation-adjusted terms. This decline is troubling. Investment in machines, office equipment, vehicles, software, and other fixed assets helps companies to boost their productive capacity. A lower average level of investment means that businesses are investing less in plant and equipment than they used to. Gross fixed capital formation measures the change in the value of fixed assets  nonresidential equipment, structures, software, research and development and entertainment, literary and artistic originals  before adjustment for consumption or depreciation of the assets. While the measure isnt the same as total investment  it excludes money put into financial assets and land, as well as additions to inventories and other non-fixed assets  gross fixed capital formation does capture the willingness of businesses to purchase capital goods that are used for productive purposes. The Federal Reserve measures the gross fixed capital formation of non-corporate, non-financial companies separately from that of corporations. Because non-corporate, non-financial businesses include all non-farm entities set up as sole proprietorships or partnerships, its a good proxy for small businesses. The figure aboveplots the inflation-adjusted average amount of gross fixed capital formation for non-farm partnerships and sole proprietorships from 1980 to 2010, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars. Two patterns emerge clearly from the data. First, the average amount that non-corporate, non-financial businesses invested in fixed assets trended upward from 1992 to 2000, and then reversed course between 2000 and 2011, with the most precipitous decline occurring during the Great Recession. Second, the average non-financial, non-farm, non-corporate business invests far less in fixed assets now than it did in the 1980s. When measured in inflation-adjusted terms, the amount that the average business invested in gross fixed capital declined from $22,560 per year (in 2010 dollars) in 1980 to $9,390 (in 2010 dollars) in 2011. In short, small businesses are not investing in capital assets to the extent that they once did. Thats not a positive sign for the future productive capacity of the small business sector.","  LONDON/HONG KONG An HSBC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch venture and financial technology firm R3 said separately on Wednesday that they had created ways of using blockchain technology to simplify trade finance processes. The two banks said they had joined with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore to emulate a letter of credit (LOC) transaction. Letters of credit are one of the most widely used ways to reduce risk between importers and exporters, helping guarantee more than $2 trillion worth of transactions, but the process creates a large paper trail and is time consuming. Meanwhile, R3 said more than 15 of its consortium member banks have also designed self-executing transaction agreements, known as smart contracts, on R3s distributed ledger platform to process accounts receivable purchase transactions, known as invoice financing or factoring, and LOC transactions.  By putting the transaction on a distributed ledger, the importer and its bank, together with the exporter and its own bank, can see the data in real time. Financial services companies around the world have been focusing on developing blockchain technology, with advocates saying it has the potential to save billions of dollars in costs and speed up transaction times. The technology, which underpins the digital currency bitcoin, creates a shared database in which participants can trace every transaction.  Discussions are underway with other banks, corporate clients and shipping companies to further develop the technology, which is in its early stages, said Vivek Ramachandran, global head of product for HSBC's trade finance business.

The process can be enough to drive you to drink! Why? Because creating a website requires you to learn a little about technology, some complex marketing techniques, and a whole new set of lingo. Sometimes it feels like the Web professionals you hire are babbling in tongues. Fortunately, after 12 years and multiple websites, the process is no longer frustrating for me. But I wish that when starting out Id had a practical book like This book is part workbook  with convenient checklists and fill-in-the-blank forms  and part primer. You get an overview of the process of creating a website. But it doesnt end with making your website live. The book takes you from inception of the website you need  to marketing your website  all the way through to maintaining your website. Here are some things I really liked about this book: The book is written by Kristi Stangeland, who owns Mustang Web Design (Twitter: ), and (Twitter: ), an online copywriter. Together they bring hands-on practical experience that comes through in the book. I was asked to review this book while it was being written and give a blurb for it, and was happy to do so for a book that so clearly speaks to small businesses. This is a good book for startup businesses, and established small businesses with up to, say, 20 employees, that are not satisfied with their current Web presence. It can be used by do-it-yourselfers. But make no mistake  it wont teach you how to code a Web page or help you choose among dozens of Web-building technologies. Primarily it is meant to help small businesses that outsource some or all of their Web work to outside providers. It shows you how to work with professionals to crystallize and communicate your business objectives to get the site you need. This is a meat-and-potatoes kind of book. You wont find cutting-edge Website design trends, a la .  You wont learn about the flavor du-jour of social media sites. You wont find that magic bullet to make  your next YouTube video go viral. But if youre searching for a solid  book to help you navigate through your first website  or overhaul  that outdated 5-year old website that you keep  apologizing for!  this is a great starting place. With ( ), you get a fundamental overview. It will help you develop and market a website that actually  brings in paying customers.","  China has extended its review of Marriott International Inc's ( MAR.O ) acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc ( HOT.N ) by up to 60 days, the companies said on Monday. China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) review is the only remaining merger clearance for the deal, which is expected to create the largest hotel group in the world with a combined enterprise value of $36 billion and 1.1 million hotel rooms. Hilton Worldwide Holdings ( HLT.N ), which would be No.2 behind the combined group, has 775,000 rooms. Marriott and Starwood did not say why MOFCOM needed more time and said their planned merger did not create any anti-competitive issues in China. The merged group would become the largest hotel operator in China with a 4.1 percent market share, followed by Homeinns Hotel & Management at 4 percent and China Lodging Group at 3.9 percent, data from research firm Euromonitor International shows. Marriott's deal to buy Starwood, the operator of Sheraton and Westin hotels, has been cleared by antitrust authorities in more than 40 countries and territories including the United States, the European Union and Canada.  The shareholders of both companies approved the deal in April. MOFCOM has developed a reputation as a tough deals regulator, but it has only blocked two transactions since China's antimonopoly law came into force in 2008, compared with 1,447 unconditional clearances, according to data compiled by law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. The regulator generally prefers to impose remedies such as asset divestments on transactions it believes could harm competition, taking this approach in 26 cases, the Norton Rose Fulbright research shows.  Last month, MOFCOM approved AB InBev's ( ABI.BR ) $100 billion-plus takeover of rival brewer SABMiller ( SAB.L ) subject to SABMiller divesting some Chinese assets. MOFCOM also extended InBev's review to phase-three, but did not make full use of the extra time. A Chinese company, Anbang Insurance Group Co [ANBANG.UL], abandoned its pursuit of Starwood in April after a bidding war that resulted in Marriott increasing its cash-and-stock bid by $1 billion. The deal is currently valued at about $13.4 billion. While Anbang had offered $14 billion in cash, an acquisition by the Chinese firm probably would have faced scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States on national security grounds.  Once notorious for its lengthy review process, MOFCOM has significantly sped-up approvals over the past 18 months following the introduction of a simple case procedure that takes about 29 days. Still, complex transactions can spend months in limbo. Deals filed via the normal procedure undergo a 30-day phase-one review, which can be extended by 90 days for phase two and by a further 60 days for the final third phase. Including pre-filing consultations with MOFCOM, a deal that goes to phase three could take nine months to clear. Unlike the European Union, MOFCOM does not operate a specific threshold for moving beyond phase one, and may do so for administrative reasons or because the watchdog is short of resources, lawyers said.

It has also raised a $200 million annual limit on the amount of funding to support investment in these sectors. The SBAs was initially launched in 2011 to support the growth and development of Americas impact investment industry. In a release announcing the change, SBA Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet (pictured above) explained: Heres what you need to know about the program. In case you arent familiar with impact investments, heres a quick : The SBAs goal with its Impact Investment Fund is tohelp capitalize Impact Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs). These companies invest funds in businesses not only with the goal of maximizing financial returns. They are also generally attempting to generate a measurable social, environmental, or economic impact. The SBA initially launched the Impact Fund as a five-year, $1 billion pilot effort.With the recent amendments to the program, its clear that the SBA plans to carry it beyond 2016. The agency had already committed to providing roughly $200 million of its $4 billion annual budget to theImpact Investment Fund. Prior to the announcement, Impact Investment Fund capital had to be aimed at businesses in underserved communities, the education sector or the clean energy sector. But with the recent addition of advanced manufacturing businesses to the list of , the SBA is making this sector a priority too. The agency is encouraging fund managers with expertise in the field to consider applying for an Impact SBIC license. Additionally, the lifting of the $200 million restriction potentially puts Impact SBICs on a par with Standard SBICs for access to funds. Also, existing Standard SBICs may opt-in as Impact SBICs through December 1, 2014. The expansion of the Impact Investment Fund means access to more potential investment for businesses in the advanced manufacturing sector, of course. This could also include companies that have already receivedSmall Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grants. But it could also mean fiercer competition for existing SBA funding funneled through the SBICs.

Economists forecast that industrial production rebounded to 0.3% after a drop by 0.4% in May, according to Bloomberg. The slowdown last month suggested that the manufacturing sector is not quite in the clear yet. They estimate that capacity utilization increased to 75.1% from 74.9%. Here's a preview from Wells Fargo's Sam Bullard: Industrial production missed expectations in May, signaling continued challenges in the factory sector. Although  utilities declined following April's surge, manufacturing output also fell and is now more or less flat over the past year. Motor vehicles & parts, a sector that has been one of the few bright spots in manufacturing over the past year or so, accounted for much of this decline. We look for a bounce back in utilities and autos to support a 0.4% increase in industrial production in June, which would largely recoup May's 0.4% decline. More to come ...

Maybe you want to protect your personal savings and other assets, maybe your financial advisor mentioned you could save in taxes, or maybe you simply need a legal structure to win a large client contract. Whatever the reasoning, its time to take the next step for your business. For the small business owner, this process raises many questions. In this post, Ill break down the steps required to incorporate a business or form an LLC, as well as explain the three different methods: do-it-yourself, legal filing service, or an attorney. In most cases, you can set up an LLC or Corporation with the secretary of states office for whichever state you choose as your state of incorporation. And as a general rule of thumb, if your business will have fewer than 5 shareholders, its best to just incorporate in the state where you actually live or have a physical presence. Heres a quick overview of the process for both the LLC and Corporation: The LLC requires much less formality, while still protecting the personal assets of the business owners from any liability of the company. For an LLC, youll need to file Articles of Organization or Certificate of Organization with your states secretary of state. While the LLC is less formal, these documents must contain at least the minimum requirements as described by state law before they can be successfully filed (and your LLC processed). To form a corporation, youll need to take the following steps: Depending on the state and its current workload, processing time may vary from 1 day to 3 months. Unfortunately, as states are facing budget issues and staffing cuts, we are seeing longer backlogs, particularly at the beginning of the year. Theres also a rush filing option, which in many states must be done via walk-in delivery. If youre filing yourself, you can bring the completed forms in person to the secretary of states office. And if youre using an online filing service, they will have a courier located near the state office to bring in your forms for rush service. The three methods for filing your Articles of Organization or Articles of Incorporation are: do-it-yourself, a legal filing service, or an attorney. For full disclosure, I am founder and CEO of CorpNet.com, an online legal filing service, but will hopefully provide objective advice here, because depending on your specific situation, each option has its own set of pros and cons. When it comes to legal matters, Ill be the first to say that trying to save a few dollars up front can end up costing you big in the long run. Trust your gut; if you feel like you need to bring in expert counsel, then by all means do so. Just remember that you are able to file for incorporation or LLC formation without an attorney, and this could be a reasonable and cost effective way to go. Whatever method you choose, make sure to pat yourself on the back for taking this important step for your business and yourself.","Go ahead  make an authors day.

And indie gadget makers have three ways to sell their new products through the site: When youre ready to sell the gadget youve created, you can list it through the Grand St. Shop. Grand St. says it previews and must approve any new listing. If a product doesnt make the cut, Grand St. notifies the maker of its reasons for rejection. If a product is approved and listed, the site takes an 8 percent commission on all sales. It takes the same commission on Beta sales. These are products that havent received any customer feedback and arent quite ready for a mass audience. A Beta product maker can pick testers for the products and await their feedback. Based on the feedback, Grand St. says the maker of the product can then decide to seek more funding for changes or get the product ready for the marketplace or pre-order sales. If a product is within six months of being ready for the marketplace, it can be sold through a pre-order feature on Grand St. The site doesnt take a commission on those sales and there are no monthly fees linked to selling on Grand St. Sellers need to handle all their customer service and shipping commitments, the company in its seller guidelines.","NEW DELHI: Copper futures traded 0.62 per cent higher at Rs 324.70 per kg today as speculators widened positions amid firm global trend and higher domestic demand.

Microsofts research shows that enabling employees to work remotely is fast becoming not a perk, but a business imperative. What aspects of working remotely still cause problems for information workers at small businesses? You might be surprised. When working remotely, just 21 percent report having had a problem collaborating with colleagues in real time; only 18 percent say theyve experienced a problem accessing internal network files. The number-one problem, cited by 40 percent of information workers was not being able to make phone calls from their computers. Not being able to easily determine if a colleague is available (cited by 28 percent) fell in the middle range of annoyances. not being able to speak face-to-face (the top issue at 42 percent); lack of a quick response (33 percent); thinking their co-workers lacked accountability (20 percent). As these results show, many of the old bugaboos about working remotely have clearly disappeared. Accessing files from outside the office is no longer a major issue, and more people understand that remote workers can be just as accountable and accessible as their peers in the office. Based on these numbers, it sounds like its a matter of perception. The lack of support from some employers may be due to outdated beliefs. And the biggest complaint peers had (not being able to speak face-to-face) can quickly be solved with Skype or simple VoIP systems. While remote work opens up new possibilities for both employees and employers, Microsoft points out it brings a new risk as well. The survey found many employees are using social networks to collaborate offsite, which means new security concerns as your business sensitive information could get exposed to prying eyes. If you are instituting remote work policies (and I hope you are), be sure you put the technology and the policies in place to eliminate the security breaches that can arise when your team uses public social networks for business purposes.","Bob Dylan once sang, The Times They Are A-Changin and these words still ring true today, some 49 years later.Marketers need to understand how their message can now be honed in with data andLoni Stark, Director of Product & Industry Marketing at Adobe, has a solution. She joins Brent Leary to discuss the five key areas of digital marketing available in the Adobe Marketing Cloud. * * * * * I have been at Adobe for over 12 years. I am responsible for product marketing for our , which is part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud.It is really perfect in the sense that I have come from a technology background. I am at the heart of digital marketing now so that combination of technology and creativity is really important as folks are looking at how to do digital marketing well. I think it is really important to understand what is possible, and how people want to interact through these technology channels. I liken this era of moving to digital marketing similar to when television was first invented. It really changed how marketers got to reach their audience and mass communications, broadcasting what was out there. Now, marketers need to understand how their message can then be honed in with data. Attention is scarce and when attention is scarce, similar to what happened with television, there is flight to quality. So marketers are starting to figure out. How do I create more compelling content and how do I make sure it is more relevant, more useful? I am amazed at the creativity in the ads that are now in digital magazines as well. Before it was static images, and they are now interactive. I think we are at a point of the I love Lucy moment. We have brought them down into what we consider the foundation for visual marketing; to be able to do things well in these five core areas. One of them we have already touched upon which is the analytics. That is about measurement. What most folks talk about, or know about from Adobe, is the online metrics that we have. But little is known about the fact that we also have the capability to measure offline. And that is really important. We talk about eCommerce, it is hot. People talk about how much money people are spending. We tend to forget that even though it is growing fast, and it will continue to grow onwards and upwards, it is still about six percent of total spend in the retail sector in the United States.So a lot of things happen offline as well and that is an important piece. The second piece is Adobe Experience Manager. That is all about the owned digital properties that companies have. In the online world Experience Manager is really about helping companies build out their own digital properties.An example of this is Hyatt, a hotel chain, and they use Experience Manager to be able to create a destination spot that people can come to and shop, and purchase hotels rooms. So that is two of the five. The third is Adobe Social. With any digital marketing strategy youve got to have a social component to that. Adobe Social is all about running social marketing campaigns through Twitter, Facebook and having fan pages managed through those channels. The fourth is Adobe Media Optimizer, so part of the marketing mix is spending it on ads. Being able to do that effectively, being able to optimize your spend to say, Hey, this ad placement through this channel is working better than this other one, so maybe I want to move more of my investment over to this otherchannel. Being able to do that in real time and being able to figure out what is the best price to pay for a particular ad based on the return. It is critical for any digital marketer. The final piece is Target. We talked about data, we talked about content and Target is the solution that brings it all together to do tests. I have a hypothesis I think you love music and I think you love this type of music, so I am going to target this particular image of this band that I think you are going to really like called The Black Keys.I could be right, but I could be wrong. So I might say there are a couple of other bands that I think you might like, Ill will try out those images. Adobe Target lets me quickly test out different images against you and people like you to figure out what image, what piece of content you are going to best resonate with. With digital marketing, the more efforts that can be measured and be more data driven, the more they can see where they are driving the highest value across to pour more money in to it. The big piece is becoming more data driven and then being able to speed up the content creation piece of it. Our website . You can check out the ,which will go into all of the five solutions. And then also I think another great resource is .","PayPal recently came under fire for possibly violating the FCCs robocall policies. The new User Agreement, which was set to golive on July 1, indicated that the company intends to robocall and text users on any number they have from them, possibly even ones that are not associated with their account. The purposes of these texts and calls are varied and could include marketing. Consumer advocacy groups pointed out that the new agreement seemed to say that users must agree to let the company send automated surveys, offers and promotions, without the ability to opt-out. There was not clear wording on whether or not the users who disagreed would have to stop using the companys services. The FCC caught wind of these changes, and (PDF) to Louise Pentland, an attorney for PayPal, stating that the company would be limited on what it could communicate to their users. The letter reads, in part: According to , PayPal has apologized to its users for the confusion. They are working on modifying the highly-criticized section (1.10) and will clarify many aspects of it. PayPal says they will only robocall or text to help detect, investigate and protect our customers from fraud, provide notices to our customers regarding their accounts or account activity, and collect and debt owed to us. After making the changes, PayPal also plans to send its customers an email reminding them of the newly edited agreement. The email, according to Louise Pentland, will also clarify that our focus is on our customers, on consumer protection and on doing the right thing.","To the mainstream business world we entrepreneurs are extremely unusual. The mainstream business world doesnt understand us. They dont understand how we do business. They dont understand our creativity. Our drive. Our ambition. The risks we take every day. And how in the world could we be successful doing some of the things we do?! We may not wear expensive suits. We may not be comfortable at a cocktail party or at the country club. And we may not be people who everyone in town knows. But we are the people who make this country strong. We are the driving force to the economy. When it comes to entrepreneurship, the rules of good business are the same but also different. To be a successful entrepreneur, theres got to be some rebel inside of you. So needless to say the book, by Jonathan Moules ( ), got my attention when the book publicist contacted me. As I began to read the book, I found the book to be right up my alley with its direct and candid approach about how to run to a successful business in the post Great Recession era. The book would be a good business read for anyone thinking of going into business, just starting out on their rebel entrepreneur journey but also any longtime rebel entrepreneurs with any sort of a business track record. is filled with examples of entrepreneurial success citing companies new and old, big and small, familiar and those not quite so familiar, plus companies of this global, Internet age we currently do business in. Some well-known entrepreneurs are mentioned too such as James Dyson, Richard Branson, Walt Disney and Steve Jobs. But beyond the names of companies and entrepreneurs who have made it big in business, the book has a lot of practical advice for business people. As I was reading the book I found myself often relating to and agreeing with the information in each chapter. Its business advice I have given to CEOs, business owners and entrepreneurs over the years. Heres a summary of whats in the book: In Chapter 8, there is a quote from Samuel Goldwyn, the famous American film producer: How true. Being an entrepreneur takes will, drive and determination. Plus a lot of long days and late nights. Constant dedication to your goal of business success. offers good, sound, practical business advice to help you build a better company no matter what is happening in the economy. Now go out and sell something. Make it happen. Be a rebel entrepreneur!","It may sound unpractical, but its true. Earlier Id work 12 hours a day, and my productivity was average. Now I work for 8 hours a day, and my productivity is 1.5 times more than before. I left my job last year to work full time on my startup. I worked harder than ever and dedicated all my time to building our product and marketing it online. Sometimes, I would work continuously for 4-5 hours. Slowly I realized that my productivity was not increasing proportionally to my increased working time.  I experimented a lot with my time in the last one year. My first startup was a total mess, and unorganized. I was working on design, product architecture, and online marketing. There was so much to learn about startups. So I would pick the most terrifying, imposing task and subsequently spend hours and hours on it, until it was finished. I remember that I finished product deployment on AWS in just three days, without any clue about cloud computing. I spent about 12-14 hours daily in order to accomplish the AWS task. This experiment looked like it was working, but it delayed other important tasks like design and marketing. I realized that AWS deployment was not worth spending 36-40 hours on. I dont know how much time I spent actually working on AWS, consideringI was worrying about design and marketing the whole time. My next experiment was to allocate a time window for each category. I divided my day into three segments, and decided to work on one type of task in each segment. In the morning, I was a designer, spending 3-4 hours on creating UI/UX. In the afternoon, I was a tech architect, learning and implementing technology, occasionally coding and fixing defects. In the late evening, I was a digital marketer, promoting our product online. This experiment improved my overall productivity and allocated equivalent bandwidth to all my work. But I was still spending 12-14 hours daily in front of the computer. I found myself wasting time on unnecessary websites & phone calls. I had to optimize my sitting time. I loved this experiment. The idea was simple, do not sit in front of the computer if you dont know what to do. Put you system to sleep and plan what to do for the day. Pick one task that needs the computer, complete the task and put your system back to sleep. I reduced my time on social media, e-commerce websites, and unfocused reading. I saved 2-3 hours each day, that I started utilizing on offline activities like playing with my kid, household work andreading books. I found myself more energetic and effective in doing online work. I have never been an early riser in life. Even in my school days, Id do my work till late at night. I never woke up early, not even on exam days. I had continued working till late night, and that was having adverse effects on my health, sleep, and mind. I was occasionally distracted by my family because I was working from home. The solution was to wake up early and finish the most important work before my kid woke up. At the same time, I shortened my sitting time to 90 minutes to 120 minutes. I started taking breaks of 60 minute to 90 minutes in between each sitting. This schedule increased my productivity significantly, and I reduced my working time. Below is my working schedule for your reference. 6:00 AM  Wake up 6:30  8:30  Focused work (Writing) 8:30  10:00  Yoga, Breakfast, Bath 10:00  11:30  Focused work 11:30  1:00  Break 1:00  2:30  Focused work 2:30  3:30  Break 3:30  5:30  Focused work 5:30  8:00  Family time and phone calls 8:00  10:00  Unallocated Buffer time 10:00 PM  Sleep My computer screen time is maximum 7-8 hours and family time is minimum 3 hours. I am still experimenting with my time schedule. I feel there is still scope for improvement. I would love to know how you are improving your productivity.","There has been plenty of buzz about the new Microsoft 2 Surface tablets. And now the devices have finally been .

The new Microsoft (pictured above, blue, right) replaces the Surface RT and the new Microsoft (pictured above, purple, left) replaces the Surface Pro. The second device is more like a tablet/desktop hybrid with what Microsoft claims is the power of a full PC. The Microsoft Surface 2 will start at $449.

Upgrading from the standard 32 GB device to 64 GB pushes the device to $549. Similarly, the Microsoft Surface Pro 2, which is what most business users will likely want, starts at $899 for a 64 GB device. An optional dock which provides added screen support and serves as a charger for the device adds nearly another $199 to the cost. Purchasing 128 GB, 265 GB or 512 GB devices will only further up the cost. Both devices feature a 10.6 inch screen, front and rear cameras and improvements over the first generation Surface devices.

Ive said it often myself. Fortunately, no one has ever asked me exactly what that meant. It appears to be a cliche or phrase that has become accepted although not clearly defined or understood. So, whats the difference between working versus your business? Employees work in the business. Most have specific duties or tasks to accomplish on a regular basis. Most know whats expected of them. The boss however, doesnt have such a clear path and few were trained to be bosses. Their tasks are self appointed and, based on my observations, quite varied from owner to owner. The result is that many work in the business sometimes and on it at other times. It appears to be a matter of priorities and fires. All too often the boss spends much of his or her time fighting fires. Rather than an owner working on the business they have become crisis managers. Many sit in their offices and wait for someone to come through the door with a problem that needs attention or resolution  now. Most owners seem to be pretty good at handling crisis problems. Some even call them opportunities. The reality is that the owner has trained his employees to bring all problems that need immediate attention to them. This, of course, takes the responsibility away from the staff and puts it squarely on the owners shoulders. I see extreme examples when a store is being remodeled or expanded. The owner then becomes the construction foreman, the architect, the designer and the one who knows where all the materials can be found. Through it all, the store keeps on running. Sales continue to be made, orders for inventory are placed; each department does its tasks. The employees know what to do on a day-to-day basis. So far there seems to be no reason to change the situation. However, there is also no leverage, no long term planning, no continuing education and the owner is getting little input other than from staff members. And most of that is negative. Okay, so what would change if the owner started working the business? First, he or she would not be the first one in and the last one out. He wouldnt necessarily come to the store every day. She would be circulating in the community making contacts with other owners of small businesses getting ideas. He would seek out organizations made up of like-minded business people in his community. She would be joining associations like the Chamber of Commerce, the Rotary Club, and the Lions Club. Once a member the owner would be attending regular meetings to become an integral part of the community. The owner would be expanding his or her circle of associates and yes, even friends, outside the industry. He or she would be spending think time, that quiet time spent thinking about the future and how to use all that knowledge bottled up inside but not exercised because of day-to-day pressures. As I travel and talk to owners I often hear them complain that they dont get as much time to do the things they like anymore; that they are working longer hours than ever and they are beginning to suffer from burnout. Well, Bunky, burnout is not uncommon. Its not something only a few suffer. If youve been in the business for a decade or more youve probably suffered some level of burnout, distress, angst that seems to be almost impossible to resolve. Youve been spending the majority of your time solving other peoples problems. Youve come to accept it as just part of the business. It doesnt have to be that way. Only you can change you. Your quality of life has to be a high priority. Some dealers have discovered that once they give their subordinates more latitude to make critical decisions those staff members rise to the occasion and become better managers themselves. Will they make mistakes? Count on it. People dont learn by doing repetitive work. They learn by making judgment calls that are not always right. They learn by being given the authority and responsibility to do a better job. As an owner it is your responsibility to mentor and coach your managers and have them do the same for those who report to them. There is an adage that says: If it can be measured it can be managed. If it is measured it can be improved. Working on your business should mean that you have the tools to measure and manage and more importantly, your managers have the training to measure and manage those who report to them. We are truly in the digital age. Computers, cameras, even phones have moved from analog to digital. Your business must do the same. You have the hardware. Now, as the owner must learn what those digital reports mean and what you need to do to implement and monitor them. On the analog side you do need to hone your mentoring and coaching skills. Fact is, your staff is closer to an extended family than a working team. Like it or not you are the Daddy or the Mommy as well as the Chief of Police and coach. However, you shouldnt be the sole fireman.","Raising the minimum wage is shaping up to be the latest in a string of President Obamas proposals that have rankled small business. The White House recently indicated it would support Illinois Democrat Dick Durbins proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour and index it for inflation, The Hill . Once again small business owners, particularly those in low margin retail and service businesses, are readying for a political battle over how they compensate employees. Boosting the minimum wage will raise the cost of employing low-skilled workers. In highly competitive industries where passing the cost on to customers in the form of higher prices is not an option, small business owners are likely to shed workers to preserve profits. As President Obamas economic advisors can explain to him, business owners pay their employees according to the economic value those employees generate. If the government sets wages higher than what employees are worth, then the businesses will lay off the unproductive ones  those who cannot produce value that exceeds the wage they are getting. Economists estimate that the proposed 39 percent increase in the minimum wage would cut employment of low-skilled workers by between 4 to 8 percent. In some industries, like leisure and hospitality where a higher fraction of workers are paid the minimum wage, employment would decline even more. Young people likely would suffer the most from an increase the minimum wage because they more likely to work in jobs that pay at or below the minimum wage. Therefore, they are the ones most likely to face layoffs if the minimum wage makes their employment no longer economically productive. Estimates by economist Joseph Sabia of the University of Georgia suggests that the 39 percent increase in the minimum wage would lead to a whopping 20 to 36 percent drop in the number of teens working at small businesses. The disappearance of these jobs will have long term effects on young people. The decline in the number of young workers means many of them wont be developing skills and generating contacts from their first jobs. And thats likely to have negative effects on their long term career prospects. A higher minimum wage also induces some teenagers to drop out of school, setting them up for a lifetime of poor earnings. University of California at Irvine economist David Neumark and Federal Reserve economist William Wascher found that the nearly 40 percent increase in the minimum wage being proposed would be expected to lower high school enrollment by as much as 8 percent. Its a cruel irony in that boosting the minimum wage will mean more impoverished people. As Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland economist Mark Schweitzer and University of California economist David Neumark have found, businesses often cut poor workers first when an increase in the minimum wage makes hiring as many workers uneconomical. Because those workers often have the least long term job potential. As a result, boosting the minimum wage means poor adults being passed over for jobs and ending up stuck in poverty. At a time when the Democrats are a minority in the House of Representatives, increasing the minimum wage would require Republicans to go along. Given the GOPs economic philosophy, however, thats not likely to happen.","As another installment in my series of articles that point out examples of great customer service, Id like to introduce you to Umpqua Bank.Umpqua Bank is committed to delivering an experience customized for each customer. Umpquas executive vice president of cultural enhancement had a goal that everybody in every store should be able to do every task. Umpqua wanted a teller who can take a mortgage application and a loan officer who is pleased to help with a safety deposit box. Beyond the banking experience, Umpqua believes in customizing experiences by community. The company leaves it to the managers in each community bank to customize their offerings based on their customers interestsfrom yoga classes in one store location (they dont use the word branch) to movie nights or a knitting club in another.Each has its own fund to enable it to customize the experience based on the lives of the customers in its community. Umpquas mission is to become a destination for customers. By offering a warm environment customized by community interests and a banking experience personalized to every customer who walks through their doors, it wants customers to think of the Umpqua Bank in their community as a gathering place. As Umpqua changed its approach from a traditional banking-style service to a customized experience, employees had to learn to juggle many duties. It meant more work initially, but now they cant imagine being limited to the individual tasks their jobs were defined as previously. As has grown with staff increases, it has retained its focus on the customer and the values that built the bank. And the company has retained its employees. Umpquas voluntary employee turnover rate is just 8 percent, compared to the banking industry rate of about 40 percent. In 2012, as a testament that this change in focus was not only good for customers but also great for employees, the company made, for the sixth year in a row, Fortune magazines list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. Are you offering great customer service? Do do your customers look forward to seeing you?","Here at we write about every terrific tip and trend imaginable to help small businesses succeed. Today, I am writing about a book from a small business owner that wants to see families, including those of small business owners, succeed. Meet Candi Sparks ( . She has been writing childrens books on the subject of kids learning about money and how to manage it. The latest book, , is part of the series, , in which its protagonist, a little boy named Max, learns the pieces to finance and a budding entrepreneurship interest. I met the author digitally during a twitter chat by , leading to a phone discussion about how Ms. Sparks discovered her writing passion. Sparks discovered her gift in 2005 while recovering from a life-threatening car accident. She noticed children in her hospital and began to wonder about their financial future, even as she struggled with hers. Given the changes in healthcare we are facing as adults, her thoughts were timely. So Sparks wrote her series as a wake up call to teach kids how to save what they earn.  Told from Maxs viewpoint, opens with a simple favor among friends. Maxs friend Emma lets him borrow a favorite video game in appreciation for his help with her softball practice. The story grows bit by bit as Max loses the game as well as a few other things which prevent him from obtaining what he wants most. Nacho Money is a joking term from Maxs brother Chris (Nacho Money is a play on Not Yo Money). Max soon realizes what Chris means behind the joke: is helpful for small business owners seeing their child losing $20 or borrowing something yet to be returned. The story is very brief. But its short structure fits on-the-go business owners who want educational material that stick with their children while their own attention is stuck on their business. The words can feel like you are prepping your child to work on Wall Street, but they entice enough for many ages and not require a spreadsheet to understand. The material is meant to keep children positive when there is a problem to solve. Heres an example. Maxs mom encourages as she asks Max: A great aspect of the book is that a parent reading along can gain some ideas as to how to approaching a money discussion with a daughter or son. After Maxs mom introduces the word debt to Max, she leave him mainly to bake a few cookies but to also let him figure out how to address his problem. I reviewed this book mainly because small business owners have to think about legacy just as much as finance, marketing, andahem, analytics. Legacy means examining the intangibles beyond assets and liabilities. Legacy also means ensuring valuable notions we provide to our children growing up are established into their personal standards, letting them make good choices growing up. Now as many business owners know, finding consistent family time to teach valuable notions can be hard to do.  Nevertheless, succeeds in subtle yet terrific ways to educate, a fit during a challenging schedule. Reminders to make the time effective appear throughout, from its foreword to a small workbook section included at the end. In its own charming way will help small business owners with families teach fiscal responsibility, and keep children entertained. Candis ability to attract young readers is well earned and is a talented author that should be introduced to your young reader. ultimately aids small business owners in minimizing a potential debt  missing what we share in the quality time with a future doctor, soldier, policewoman, or entrepreneur.","Small businesses added 78,000 jobs from December to January, at a rate faster than the countrys largest companies. That figure comes from the monthly ADP National Employment Report issued Feb. 4, 2015. But it marks a slowdown in growth for small businesses, as it pertains to employment totals. By comparison, from November to December of last year, small businesses nationwide. And in the three months prior to that, small businesses had added at least 101,000 jobs per month. Despite the dip in growth, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moodys Analytics, says that 2015 should mark a year of growth overall. ADP releases its monthly National Employment Report in conjunction with Moodys. Zandi said in a accompanying the report: ADPs report considers small businesses any with 49 or fewer employees. The largest growth was seen among medium-sized businesses, those with between 50 and 499 employees. And it was the only segment in ADPs report which experienced a faster rate of job growth compared to last month. Medium-sized businesses added 95,000 employees in that time. Large companies added just 40,000 jobs from December to January. This segment of companies, like small businesses, slumped a little in its growth total from last month. Overall, there were 213,000 jobs added by all private, non-farm jobs between December and January. Breaking down the figures among small businesses, the smallest of them  those with 19 or fewer employees  added about 38,000 jobs. Those with 20 or more added about 40,000 jobs between December and January. Most of the total small business jobs created are in the service sector. Thats where about 73,000 of the 78,000 new jobs were added. Goods-producing companies added about 6,000 jobs, according to ADPs estimates. Nationally, the service industry added the most jobs in the last month, a total of 183,000 of them. That rate of growth is down, however, from the 203,000 service jobs added between November and December. There were 31,000 goods-producing jobs last month. And the construction industry added 18,000 jobs. Manufacturing companies added about 14,000 jobs nationwide. Carlos Rodriguez, the president and CEO at ADP said in a statement:","Have you ever been in this situation: you want to start a direct mail campaign, or plan your next tradeshow presence, or overhaul your website. But as soon as you sit down to work on it, creative ideas flee your mind. You just cant seem to come up with ideas for anything fresh and different to get started. Thats the kind of situation that the new book is designed to remedy. is an idea starter. It gives you examples of how other small businesses today are using visual elements in their marketing to be creative on small budgets. is written by Anita Campbell and David Langton. Anita is the CEO here at . She also operates a number of other online communities, such as and , that reach millions of small businesses every year. David Langton is an award-winning visual communications designer with the firm Group in New York City. Rather than do a standard book review, we thought it might be fun to take you behind the scenes of with this two-part interview with the authors. In part 1 below, Anita Campbell gives you a glimpse behind the curtain into the process of writing the book. In part 2 the authors explain some key learnings for small businesses about how to use visuals in your marketing. Ive about writing a book for years. But for a long time I actively resisted it.Many consultants and independent professionals see a book as a way to develop credentials, attract speaking engagements and lead to consulting gigs. Thats a great strategy  for them. But that doesnt align with my business expectations. Mine is a different path. I run a specialized publishing business. My primary business goals are to grow my online publishing properties, and to expand the types of content we provide. That goal has taken all my energy, and I was concerned I wouldnt have time to write. Over the years, though, I had developed an email correspondence with an editor from Wiley. Hed email me. I would think about a book, decide I didnt have the time, then go work on more-pressing priorities. Rinse and repeat. A couple of years go by. One day he said, I want you to meet somebody. I happened to be in New York for a British Airways contest that I was judging, and agreed to meet the Wiley editor and David Langton, my co-author. We got together in a Starbucks (where else?) in Grand Central Terminal. David, who owns a New York Web and graphics design firm, had an idea for a book about the visual elements of marketing. I was immediately excited. We hit it off, and several weeks later we had a book contract. It was that fast. The goal in putting us together was to meld two types of expertise. Davids is professional design. Mine is an understanding the realities of marketing your small business  where money, time and staff are limited. David and I had a divide and conquer strategy. We divided up the work according to our strengths. David focused on assessing the design case studies with a professional eye. I focused on writing about them in a way relevant to small businesses. Thats how we conquered it! With David in New York and me 500 miles away in Ohio, this was a true long-distance collaboration. We relied greatly on collaboration tools, email and conference calls: We also got great help. Susan Payton from served as technical editor for the book, and Norman Cherubino (Davids business partner) assisted in reviewing design projects. Without them, we might still be writing the book! Writing! Seriously, its tough to find time for a book. Think about the hundreds of hours involved. Once you get into a creative flow, you face another problem. Its challenging to stick with it when you get bored  and you have moments of boredom. In fact, there will be times when you will work on the stupidest, most trivial things just to keep from facing your book that day. There are a ton of details involved with writing a book.  Thats multiplied several times over when you have 99 case studies, two images for each, and multiple people or firms involved with each design project. Theres a lot of followup, a lot of images to sift through, a lot of people to interview, a lot of signed permissions, a lot of drafts  just ! If you dont stay focused on how great its going to feel once youre done (to keep you motivated), that mountain of details can crush your zest. Another challenge: resolving differences of opinion. David was a joy to work with. But two people who are creating something are bound to see things differently now and then. If you want to complete that book and remain friends, you have to seek out common ground. Its a key skill for co-authors. Im blown away by the good wishes of friends, colleagues and even social media contacts who Ive never met. Authors have no choice but to promote their own books today. Unless you are a famous public figure like Hilary Clinton or J.K.Rowling, the publisher can only do a limited amount of promotion. And there are more books than ever competing for reader eyeballs. That means as the author, you have to get comfortable talking about your book regularly. And thats hard to do, because you dont want to come off like a walking sales pitch. So whenever I mention the book publicly, its always with trepidation. The heartfelt and sincere good wishes are doubly welcome. The books examples gave me even more respect for the creativity of small businesses and the service providers (marketing firms, designers, printers) that support them. The books design examples contain some that Fortune 1000 companies would be proud of. But some of the ones that touched me the most deeply are those done on low, low budgets. Those often were the most memorable. is a terrific book for creative designers, marketers and business owners who are looking for new and effective ways to bring life to their product or service. Its not a design book, i.e., it wont show you how to design your new postcard mailers. But it will show you well-thought out examples to help you trigger new ideas.","Upstarts is the new book by Donna Fenn about young entrepreneurs from Generation Y. The book is filled with fascinating stories and case examples of these young entrepreneurs. The full title of the book is Before I delve deeper into the book, let me explain Generation Y  called GenY for short. These are individuals born between 1977 and 1997. The book covers some of the 77 Million of them in the United States  the ones that have started and now run businesses. One of the trends weve written about here at over the years is how entrepreneurship keeps attracting younger and younger people. It used to be that people started businesses AFTER school. Then they started them in their dorm rooms at college (remember the famous story of how Michael Dell started selling computers from his dorm room back in the 1980s?). Guess what? Now entrepreneurs are starting businesses in their teens, before they are out of high school. As Professor Jeff Cornwall of Belmont University is quoted as saying in the book, Forty percent or more of students who come into our undergraduate entrepreneurship program as freshmen already have a business. Its a whole new world. This movement toward earlier and earlier entrepreneurship is what the book covers. The book covers over 150 entrepreneurs from Generation Y. While a few of the entrepreneurs are the usual suspects that you may have read about before, there are many others who will be new to you, with stories just as interesting. Most operate technology, consumer-lifestyle or services businesses. But there are a wide range of businesses represented, including retail, media and manufacturing. Theres even a section on reinvigorating family businesses through GenY blood. For instance, the book covers Emily Powell, the 29-year-old heir apparent to Powells Books. Then theres Kathy Vegh, a GenY-er who is now CEO and 49-percent owner of Danny Veghs Billiards. For those who are running a business or who leverage today, or who have always been committed to , you may not find the points made about those and other topics revolutionary. You already may be operating your business according to those same principles the GenY entrepreneurs employ in their businesses. But then again  maybe not. Chances are there is at least you can learn from the experiences of these GenY entrepreneurs. The most intriguing part of is all the stories and case studies. The book is absolutely stuffed with them. You can tell the book was carefully researched because of the detail. Another part of the appeal is the writing and editing (published by McGraw Hill). The author, Donna Fenn, writes energetic prose that holds your interest. The book is highly readable. The information is presented as colorful vignettes. Its almost as if you could be watching short video snippets of these entrepreneurs  thats how vivid some of it seems. Theres a lot of human interest in this book. If you like getting brief glimpses into entrepreneurs business lives and hearing tidbits about how they grew their businesses, you will certainly like this book. Once I started reading my review copy of , I could hardly put it down. And as you read about the challenges these entrepreneurs faced, it may inspire you to feel more confident in confronting your own businesss issues. After all, if an 18-year-old can overcome a gnarly problem, shouldnt you be able to, with all your years of experience? Upstarts is an analytical book. It examines successful GenY entrepreneurs and gives you a glimpse into what they are doing well and what drives them. There are two groups of people who will benefit from this book. First, this is a book for marketers, policy-makers, educators and others who are trying to understand what makes GenY entrepreneurs tick. If you have a deep motivation to know more about GenY entrepreneurs, and how to appeal to this group for any product or service offering, this book is ideal. You will get a strong sense of what drives these entrepreneurs as a generation. You will get a picture of how they approach their businesses. Second, I think is perfect for anyone trying to capture a little of the magic behind the phenomena of todays successful startups. Do you love reading about how others did it? Are you looking for something to inspire you or trigger an idea or two that you can try in your own business? Then you may well find it in . If the book gets you to try just one different approach or identifies one breakthrough idea, it is well worth the $17 price tag at Amazon. If you are looking for detailed how to instruction for improving your own business, or a step-by-step guide for how to start a business, is not that book. Yes, I know what the title says. And yes, at the end of each of the eight chapters there is a summary of points called Upstarts Playlist of about 2 pages each. But these pages total just 16 pages or so out of about 240. In other words, not a lot of attention is placed on the advice. Plus, the advice in these Playlists is broad and general. Examples: Find a mentor or Assemble the right team. If you hunger to know HOW to assemble the right team, though, you wont get it from . doesnt even delve deeply into how the GenY entrepreneurs did it for their own businesses. At most it summarizes the problems they had due to not having the right team. Dont expect it to give you a roadmap for any ideas you pick up from the book, if you run a small business or startup. But if you are a marketer to GenY entrepreneurs, or you are looking for something to ideas and inspire your own business, you definitely want to","Last year Amazon launched Amazon WorkSpaces, a virtualization service for desktops. Now the company is taking their service a step further with . The name might be a bit of a mouthful but the service could simplify desktop apps for business owners. Though originally allowed you to virtually share software among users on a variety of devices from laptops to tablets to smartphones, the apps store is the next logical step. It not only puts those applications in the cloud but also lets you pay for only what you and your employees or contractors use. Thats right, you only pay when a product is launched. Amazon claims that AWS Marketplace for Desktop Apps makes it easy to search for and buy applications. The company boasts a broad selection of more than100 apps in more than 10 categories. Options include Microsoft Office and Visual Studio, Python, and CorelDRAW. Billing has been made easier, too. Applications can be purchased on a monthly subscription basis and, as stated above, you will only be charged if the product is launched. All prices are listed and software charges appear on one AWS MarketPlacebill. AWS Marketplace for Desktop Apps lets you select applications you and others in your business can use via Amazon Workspaces. Apps are managed from a centralized console through Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (Amazon WAM). According to Amazon, WAM will allow business owners to control access to their curated selection of apps. Through WAM they can do things like set the number of installations per organization, provision apps, deliver specific versions to end users, and more. There are two subscription tiers of Amazon WAM available. Amazon WAM Lite is free but has limited administration controls. For a fee of $5 per user per month, you can gain access to Amazon WAM Standard. This tier gives more admin control such as the ability to audit app usage, and manage versions and updating. But perhaps the best feature of Standard is the ability to catalog third party apps as well as internally-developed custom apps.","Last month, four researchers (and business/finance professors from the University of Texas, the University of California, Los Angeles and New York University) published a study titled,   The answer? A lot. The study found that small business loans are critical to a startups success. These study results were not a surprise and they are consistent with lots of other market data thats been talked about for a long time. When properly acquired and properly utilized, small business financing helps businesses grow. The group reviewed five years of startup loan applications from Accion Texas, a lender providing capital to startups across the country. (Startup is defined as a new business, open 6 months or less and the majority of applications were for retail and restaurant businesses.) The study found that: Other key findings include: The study illustrates the importance of access to credit and is another reminder that borrowing capital, when done correctly, can be critical for business success. Small business financing is like a lot of other things. Its a tool that can be used wisely for great things. It can also be used poorly, in which case it will not help your business grow.","PNC Bank has a new online tool thats designed to create a picture of your companys cash flow.Cash Flow Insight is being marketed to small businesses.

If this isnt a problem you encounter often, then you probably werent aware that bright lights help keep the predatory animals away at night. But it is a problem for farmers in rural Africa  and so is getting electricity to their homes. Until recently, one of the only solutions to this problem was to use old-fashioned kerosene lamps. These lamps use expensive fossil fuel and emit poisonous fumes when burned. But now theres a company working on a better, greener solution. is a company based in Nairobi, Kenya thats backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The company offers a portable solar powered lighting system that it says can ward off lions at night. M-KOPA offers a pay-as-you-go system for customers. So instead of buying the lighting system, which would be much too expensive for most households that need this technology, they make daily payments to use it. The system costs the equivalent of about 45 US cents per day to use, along with an initial deposit. But thats still a big investment for a lot of people who would like to use the lighting system. Kim Lachance Shandrow of Entrepreneur : Payments are processed using an embedded mobile SIM card. So if a customer falls behind, M-KOPA can use the SIM card to turn out the lights remotely. Right now, only a select few who can afford it are able to get the benefits of these solar powered lights. So in order for the M-KOPA lighting system to be widely adopted in East Africa, the company will have to find a way to bring the price down. But its a good first step in introducing a more innovative way of solving a problem. Solar powered technology is still a relatively new field and people are coming up with new uses for it all the time. Warding off lions is probably not the first application that comes to mind when you think about solar power. But someone did think of it  and now theyre finding a way to benefit a community that really needs it.","I bet like any other business owner you want more clients and ideally, you would like them to knock on your door. After all, whats better than a lead who has found you by themselves and reaches out for a quote? Enter content marketing. Content offers opportunity. It can expose your business to a multitude of new prospects. With content you can target potential clients at different stages of the buying cycle, not to mention with different buyer intents. You can nurture your leads until they are ready to buy or fix a problem for them. But here is the catch, all of this doesnt happen by itself. Creating great content isnt enough. To get the most out of your content marketing efforts, you need to actively promote it to reach your target audience. As someone once said, a successful content strategy is 20% creation and 80% promotion. But most of the time, your content strategy falls short by missing some crucial elements. Your content should end up in front of your target audience, fast. To get it out there, use paid advertising. But, of course, not every piece of content deserves paid promotion. When it comes to heavy magnitude pieces, however (content thats designed to attract large numbers of qualified leads to your site  ebooks, white papers, reports etc.), paid advertising is by far  a must. Even the best content might fail if the other pieces of lead generation strategy arent working. One of which are landing pages  Web pages dedicated to a specific aspect of your business. Unlike your website, which has to cater to all of your prospects, landing pages allow you to pitch to a very specific lead, someone with a particular problem you hold a solution to. Thanks to landing pages, if a particular piece of content attracts your target audience, they will have a business reference point to find out more about how your business could help them. Content marketing is an integral part of the entire marketing communications. Most of the time however, it is created separately from other marketing activities. Blog posts, videos, graphics, comic strips and other content types, however, can complement your overall marketing and branding efforts and not work outside of it. It is unfortunate that content marketing is often considered synonymous with blogging. Blog posts are one of the most common content types created, true. There are, however, many other types you could use, not only to educate, but also entertain your audience. Comic strips, quizzes, memes, videos, games, apps, white papers, PDF reports and ebooks all form a content mix you should be availing of. Naturally, not all content types will work in your industry. But you should at least try to go beyond blogging when planning your content strategy. A challenge when creating your content strategy is speaking to a specific audience. Since you cant see the person thats going to read your words, its hard to relate to them and write with them in mind. To overcome this, you should develop content personas to help you better target your content. Industry influencers are great to leverage your content. Since they already have an audience, anything they share or get involved with immediately gets attention. Involve them in your content strategy and marketing, especially at the early stages to quickly put your website in front of your audience. Some of the best ways to do so include interviews or expert roundups. Lastly, its hard to know if your content strategy is successful without measuring its performance. There are a number of ways to do it, from creating a simple excel spreadsheet to track KPIs to using sophisticated testing platforms outputting all the data you need to know. The key is to always measure, analyse and repeat whats working in your content strategy.","Im a firm believer that everyone should have their own business or sideline business, as well as passive revenue. Online businesses offer the opportunity for both. Thats why I was excited to receive a review copy of,  , by well-known entrepreneur and author, Joel Comm (Wiley, 2010). Since I already make a portion of my revenues from my online businesses, I consider myself at least intermediate in my knowledge of online marketing and how to create online revenue streams. I wasnt sure if Id really learn anything from this book, but I figured Id at least enjoy it. I like how Comm set up the structure of the book. He starts by giving an overview, then explains the importance of niches (this concept can never be hammered home enough, in my un-humble opinion), before stating the primary ways to make money online. He also shares his seven keys to online success, and gives examples: Comm shares with the reader the primary ways to make money online: blogging and other online content, information products, affiliate programs, membership sites and coaching programs. Case studies and specific examples, as well as resources to make the process easier, help explain the sometimes tricky world of online business. And if youre someone who enjoys a book that contains how-to information, you wont be disappointed. Comm is not only a strategist, but he created a well-known . In this book he explains a concept such as using Google AdSense ads to make money online, as well as some of the coding techniques to make it more effective. If you are a beginner, youll definitely learn some great ways, as well as important models, to make money online. If you are already making money online, youll probably gain a few useful nuggets to help you achieve even more success.","REUTERS/Russell Cheyne Stocks closed lower on Friday, and finished slightly in the red for the quiet summer week.

The rule  basically a penalty  is aimed atemployers who are helping their employees offset the cost of health insurance with small incentives, additional compensation or reimbursing employees for health insurance. While it comes with hefty fines, the new tax rule is rather obscure and will likely be overlooked by some small business owners. For many employers, reimbursing employees for health insurance is an easy way to help their employees without establishing an official group policy. This can be particularly helpful if the small business is relatively new or doesnt have an HR department. It isnt as if health reimbursement accounts are new. These have traditionally been a valuable tool used by business owners to provide health insurance to their staff without taking on the administrative cost and burden of establishing their own policy. According to research, 14percentof small business owners use this technique to provide coverage to their employees without having a company insurance offering. Many, however, are unaware of this new penalty that directly targets that behavior. Employers who are found to be assisting employees with the cost of health care through supplemental income can be fined $100 a day per employee, up to $500,000 per year. The implementation on July 1 only occurred after the Treasury Dept.delayed enforcement of penalties of this new rule. That delay expired on Wednesday, however, and businesses can now be charged for failure to comply. This number is actually quite shocking, considering the difference between this fine and the one imposed on employers who fail to offer group insurance altogether. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers are required to offer coverage, but if they fail to comply with the employer mandate they can only be fined up to $2,000 per year. The stark difference between these penalties and the widespread use of HRAs has caused many to push for new legislation to overrule the new IRS policy. If Congress repeals the IRS ruling, this problem could be solved. But in the meantime, small business owners offering to offset the cost of health insurance for their employees may face high fines. While this rule may not be long in effect, small business owners would be wise to keep their eye on this under-reported IRS rule, or consult with a trusted tax professional. If the policy isnt repealed, these business owners could face staggering fines with the very real potential to cripple their company. Expand your knowledge with these , and that will keep you compliant.","A new business trend is making headlines. Pricey play date consultants are being hired by well-to-do Manhattan parents. The idea is to prepare children at an early age to make it into highly competitive private kindergartens. Sound crazy? Well, some media outlets and are at these services expense. Yes, consultants are charging upwards of $400 an hour in some cases. And what they teach children certainly seems obvious. Lessons include how to share crayons, be at ease and play with other children. The young clients, it seems, are already overburdened by too many private lessons in violin and Mandarin to learn this on their own. But to be fair, consulting businesses offering this new and expensive option also provide plenty of other more accepted services. A glance at the website of one such firm, , shows services like tutoring and test prep, for example. The idea of greater competition in the education system leading to more need for support services is nothing new. Greater importance placed on standardized testing increased demand for test prep professionals in the first place.

The marketing automation software company he founded and heads up has achieved over 50% sales growth the past 2 years by serving the lifestyle entrepreneur. Masks remarks were made as Infusionsoft kicks off its annual customer event for 2014, called . The event attracts 3,000 customers and partners, and this year they are attending from over 70 countries around the world. In Infusionsofts definition, lifestyle entrepreneurs are those with under 25 employees. These business owners are seeking freedom. And they arent looking so much for work-life balance, but in Masks words they seek work-life harmony. These are entrepreneurs who dont aspire to grow their companies to the Fortune 500. They are not going out of their way to add a lot of employees or grow huge. Rather, they are building businesses that allow them more free time for personal and family purposes, while still bringing financial success. Mask says that some use the term lifestyle entrepreneur as a pejorative term, but we focus on them. We want to serve them. Infusionsoft has seen its growth result from understanding exactly the small business it intends to serve. Ninety-six percent of Infusionsoft customers have fewer than 25 employees. And he says that focus will remain. Infusionsoft doesnt view its mission as serving smaller entities merely as an entry point to go upstream. Were not in this just to get a toehold into larger companies  we are committed to this under-25 employee market, said Mask. He is quick to add that Infusionsoft will not abandon those that do grow larger, noting we will grow with them. According to Mask (pictured above), one of the problems facing small businesses is that they are misunderstood. The government says a small business has up to 500 employees. Some vendors also describe it that way, or they may have some other definition such as 100 employees. But when your business has 5 employees its frustrating to hear from a vendor trying to sell you a product with a much larger business in mind, he adds. That actually leads to some of the failure in small businesses, because they end up with tools and products they cant use. Not only is Infusionsoft ultra-specific about the size of the customers it serves, but it is just as specific about their ability to benefit fromthe product. Mask says they look for businesses that have reached $100,000 in annual revenues, and intentionally steer away most that have not reach that level,as they are not far enough along to be able to benefit from the product. About 10% of our customers are in that very early stage [under $100,000] but they are committed to getting past that level, he notes. But its not all about numbers. Mask is nothing if not passionate about the mission of serving small businesses. In fact, throughout the Infusionsoft headquarters in Chandler, Arizona the mission is pasted on the walls  literally  to remind each person of why they are there. My passion comes from the compassion I have from the plight of the entrepreneur, because weve been there. Its not because we think theres a part of the market being underserved. It comes from US being underserved. We were there. We saw the sacrifices and the failure  and we are on a mission over a long period of time to change the small business failure rate, says Mask. We help customers create the kind of predictable success that enables them to grow without fear of everything caving in one day, he adds. That passion flows throughout the organization, too. Infusionsofthires employees who share the companys purpose, value and mission. Half of our employees have a side business. The vast majority have run or worked in a small business. Infusionsoft has over 23,000 customers, 73,000 users and 500 employees. The companys revenues grew from $39 million to $60 million from 2012 to 2013.","If your website was built using WordPress, one of the best things you can do for your small business is to learn how to install a WordPress plugin. While that may sound like hyperbole, consider this: WordPress plugins, the majority of which are free, extend and expand the functionality of your website up to and including the ability to automate and manage your business  from online marketing to lead capture and from sales to delivery  faster and more consistently than you do today. How many more clients or customers could your business add and serve using that extra time? Thats the power of WordPress plugins. There are currently more than available atwordpress.org. Thats a lot. But dont let the sheer number of plugins scare you away, because were going to show you how to pick a good plugin out of that pile. Then were going to show you how to install a WordPress pluginyou chose on your own site so you can start reaping the benefits of the plugins added functionality to manage your business. Of course, . When you create your WordPress site over at , youre using the hosted option. While not as customizable as the self-hosted option, its the perfect platform if you want to get up and running quickly. Unfortunately, your choice of plugins is much more limited when your site is hosted and that curtails the benefits you can realize from using plugins. If you create your WordPress website over at one of the many available hosting companies, youre using the self-hosted option. Infinitely customizable, self-hosted WordPress sites can use any of the 36,375 plugins available over at wordpress.org and thats a good thing. Because of feature enhancements and bug fixes, WordPress code is updated on a fairly regular basis. After each update, theres always a chance that a plugin that worked with the older version of WordPress may not work with the new one. To make a particular plugin work with the latest version of WordPress, it needs to be updated as well and therein lies the problem. Since most plugin developers offer their work for free, they sometimes drop the project somewhere along the way and the plugin stops getting updated. These plugins are dead and if a plugin you are using dies, youll need to search for a replacement. To minimize the chance that youll face this headache, you should always pay attention to these two factors when selecting a plugin to install: A plugin that gets updated often is a plugin that is less likely to die. To figure out if your plugin has been updated to the latest version of WordPress, first visit the plugins page on wordpress.org and look underneath the header on the right. There youll see up to which version the plugin is compatible (in the image below, thats version 4.1.1). Next, head on over to the front page of wordpress.org and look at the lower of the blue download buttons on the right. As you can see, WordPress version 4.1.1 is the latest WordPress update, so the plugin above is A-OK. Another way to check this is to search for a plugin using your WordPress dashboard (more on how to run that search in just a bit). As you can see in the search results below, one of the plugins was tested and declared Compatible and one was not. Always try to select plugins that are tested and compatible as that means theyre up to date (assuming of course that you keep your WordPress version up to date which you should). One other thing to beware of is when the Last Updated date is more thana year old (and many, many of them are). If thats the case, its likely that the plugin is dead. Since most plugins are free, theres not a lot of incentive for a developer to provide support. They need to have the passion to continue supporting their work and the drive to see it through. As this is the case, you should always check on the level of attention a developer devotes to support before selecting theirplugin. To do so, visit the plugins page on wordpress.org and click on the Support tab as shown below: Once youre at the support discussion forum for that plugin (as shown below), look around to see what you can find. Does the developer respond in a timely manner or do questions languish for weeks? Do they provide service with a smile or are they snippy and rude? Bad service is a strong sign that the plugin may be dying. There are two ways to install a WordPress plugin using the WordPress dashboard: Here are the steps to follow: Here, you can begin your search for plugins using the first of three methods. Using the links at the top, you can look for Featured, Popular, Recommended and Favorites plugins. This is the best way to search if you want to explore whats out there for you to use for your own site. This image also shows the, More Details link that well talk about in step 5. Note the tabs along the top (under the red image). Heres where you can learn all about the plugin as well as see screenshots of the plugin in action. If youre ready to install this plugin, click the blue Install Now button on the bottom left of the details screen. It is possible to install a plugin without activating it (e.g. you install a new plugin but want to minimize the impact if something goes wrong when you activate it so you dont activate it until the weekend when your website traffic is lower), which is why you see the choice to activate the plugin above. Lets say were ready to forge ahead and click the, Activate Plugin link. Often, a WordPress plugin will have a free version with basic functionality and a premium version with expanded features. When you purchase a premium plugin, you typically receive a .zip file containing the plugin. Use this approach to install your new plugin: Choose to save the file and then click, OK: Note: if you dont see a screen like the one below, your file was saved to you Downloads directory automatically so look for it there. Head on over to the Add Plugins screen and click the Upload Plugin button as shown below:","Im going to admit something kind of geeky. I really like favicons.  Theyre fun.

The median of economists' forecasts for the change in nonfarm payrolls is 172,000, according to Bloomberg. They expect the unemployment rate to remain unchanged near an eight-year low of 4.9%. More wage growth is forecast for American workers. Average hourly earnings are estimated to rise 0.3% month-on-month, and 2.6% compared to September 2015. If wages do continue their uptrend, that could provide some of the higher inflation that the Federal Reserve has long said it expects to see. Markets will be focusing on the Fed where this report is concerned, as expectation rises that it will raise its benchmark interest rate at its December meeting. For everyone else, if these forecasts hold, the report should continue to affirm the job market's strength and its progress towards full employment. ""The combination of more moderate payroll growth, accelerating wage gains and risk for a lower unemployment rate should lend a constructive tone to the report,"" said TD Securities strategist Brittany Baumann. ""Finally, one aspect of the report that gets less attention is average weekly hours, which dipped to a 2-year low of 34.3 hours in August. A recovery to 34.4 is expected and would be a welcome development as the low read is not encouraging for economic activity in the second half of this year.""","When it comes to small business owners facing decisions, a movie quote that truly captures the feeling comes from Keanu Reeves as Neo in The Matrix Reloaded, when he confronts the Architect and says, Choice. The problem is choice. Although Reeves statement was regarding the Matrix program in the movie series, most small business owners regard effective online marketing with similar feelings of revelation. you ponder. Justin Cutroni, director of digital intelligence at Cardinal Path ( ), Sebastian Tonkin, CEO of Cloud 9, and Caleb Whitmore, founder and lead consultant at Analytics Pros ( ), have joined together to write a book thats not only a great resource, but makes the discovery of choice a cause for celebration rather than anguish. is a fit for small businesses that needs marketing improvements to successfully achieve their objectives but are unsure how to incorporate Google Analytics beyond what is visible on a webpage. I picked up a copy from a Barnes & Noble in Manhattan . is divided into sections that thoroughly elaborate on the kinds of Google Analytics reports and analysis available. introduces the basics: What Web analytics is, the challenges in implementing Web analytics, and what holds firms back from succeeding with analytics reporting. delves into implementation and configuration of Google Analytics, as well as the basic and advanced concepts in the reports. examines advanced usage to analyze display and sponsored search ads, organic search engine optimization, offline, email marketing and other marketing tools. focuses on organic search, addressing SEO questions. covers a comprehensive summary of plug-ins and online resources, including blogs from many in the Web analytics community. Its a great resource for small businesses that have an employee tasked with measurement duties but are not sure where else to turn. The book informs the reader well because it pinpoints the significance of Google Analytics features regarding common marketing challenges. The authors show how to assess the metrics and dimensions in the user interface, such as their comparison of long tail and head keywords to increase online presence. Another suggestion notes how Google Analytics can sometimes offer clues about search queries through examining visitor patterns after seeking a term. Such searches are an indicator that you are missing content that visitors are searching forand that could potentially attract more visitors. That content can be article topics (for a blog) or products and services (for sale online). In each chapter, you can learn how to easily support a business objective with analytics. A Venn diagram for the city, region and visitor settings from the Map Overlay is an inspired instance of applying advanced segmentation. Other tidbits include Pivot Tables and inverse inclusion of traffic segments. These topics make the book a gotta-have in the business library, be it a den or iPad. Although an analytics solution can make your business decisions easier, it can take multiple steps of analysis to make the data useful to your business decisions. Thats what makes terrific. The book scales well for small businesses managing a marketing campaign and thus find themselves searching for those right steps. There are clear suggestions for mobile, social media and online video, as well as a nod to television ads. All of it can be understood by chapter or collectively based on your need. If you have experience with Google Analytics, you will find the feature descriptions familiar (Lets face it; theres only so many ways to explain a first user cookie). Not surprisingly, this material complements the coding and installation steps contained in Justin Cutronis book also offers a few words on API development. Its working knowledge, but for many small business owners, thats enough. More than one of the best analytics books available, reflects the promise of collective intellectual capital, gathering the knowledge of experienced professionals to address practical, get-it-done marketing matters. Moreover, business owners will become fluent enough to comfortably convey their questions to the analytics practitioners who keep their marketing and websites humming. Give a read, and your business performance will get a boost from experienced insights.","Ill admit Ive been one of those people. You know, the ones who are a bit disoriented when they are away from the cellphone. You have to give me a break. Analytics requires internet access, so I have heard, and a multi-feature smartphone with hotspot capability has become the Ernie to my Macbook Pros Bert. But as bring your own device has spread and more professionals are looking to accomplish tasks while on the go, the methods organizations have learned to manage an always-on work environment, if not society, have been called into question. is an example of how valuable work-life balance research has grown. Extending the charge for new life balance is the new book by Leslie A. Perlow. When I read my publisher copy, I could not help but realize how essential we need a rethink in professional availability. This brief book speaks to large business, but also works for small business networks that are emulating big business processes more by the day. opens with its first chapters examining Perlows experiment with Boston Consulting Group, a high demand advisory firm that serves global firms. The experiment was to have a few teams try Predictable Time Off (PTO), a specific schedule away from the regular team tasks. PTO wont solve all your problems. Instead it unlocks a more persuasive opening about work related and work life issues. That openness, according to Perlow, can lead to better planning and discussions because issues surface that would otherwise be ignored. PTO at first glance may not sound like breakthrough thinking. But the fact of the matter is that we can be so focused on managing always on devices and processes that basic what-are-we-doing conversations are overlooked. Perlow calls this focus the cycle of responsiveness  altering ones time to meet the increased demand on their time. And I can say I am seeing this as much of a challenge for small business as it can be for the consulting profession Perlow examines. As the first half of the book covers the experience Boston Consulting Group, you will get to draw some of yourself from the experience. So what were the results of the experiment? Perlow noted a comparison of teams, ones that embraced PTO and others that ignored it. In that comparison, several notable differences in attitude towards work and working together resulted  attitudes which, in real-life, would lead to teams better suited to address problems and solve them: The results also imply a thought shift  teams felt more confident to take more beneficial risks. Thus, people are better able to consider more strategic ways that ultimately influenced how a business is run: That the question the second half makes a team answer, through its explanation and how-to implementation. For fostering communication, I felt the steps Perlow offers are as valuable for small business teams as well as corporate teams. Again there is no earth-shattering new concept  how to manage a teams time  but the book provides a good arrangement of what to do in your team or organization. The takeaways and implementation steps are useful: All these chapters are linked with the authors emphasis on a slow process in infusion, requiring champions to develop the right level of expectations for improving productivity. It reflects a wisdom of building trust which technological usage can make us forget easily. may not solve every challenge you face, but it will enlighten any team trying to sync among themselves while questioning the worthwhile of on-demand accessibility. To note Perlows coined successaholic question  Is on-demend accessibility really worthwhile or just a badge of honor? Its up to you to decide. And you may still be one of those people  if so, welcome to the club, brother! But after reading this youll be more aware of your teammates conferenced on the smartphone who feel they can deliver your deliverable and still have a life.","Cloud computing or the cloud is one of todays hottest computing concepts. Its increasingly how small and midsize businesses take advantage of automation and improve operations and effectiveness. The Cloud makes it easier for the distributed workforce, with remote employees, to operate as a team and share information. The Cloud provides a central place for proprietary databases and applications. It saves money too, because the Cloud typically requires less investment in capital equipment. Computing operations can be hosted virtually in a central data center, reducing maintenance costs of maintaining equipment on premises. And the cloud is also an integral element of backup and disaster recovery plans for many organizations. If one location is inaccessible (such as when Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast U.S. last year), organizations with cloud-based backup systems can continue operating with minimal or no interruptions. But how does your organization connect to cloud applications and data stored in the cloud? We dont mean how individual users connect necessarily, but rather how your network connection is set up to pass information among your systems and access applications. You may think theres only one practical choice: use a regular Internet connection. Many small companies start out that way. But one of the trends we are noticing is that a dedicated Ethernet connection for accessing the Cloud, is now within reach for smaller businesses. In the past these dedicated networks and connections were available mainly for large enterprises  and too pricey for smaller businesses. On top of that, they were often complex to set up and maintain. But as technology takes on a central role in smaller organizations, and demand for secure access increases, ISPs are coming out with new offerings at price points designed for small and midsized companies. And not only is the price within reach, but the setup and maintenance can be outsourced now to your ISP. Here are some advantages of a dedicated Ethernet network to access your cloud assets: As weve pointed out before, . Smaller organizations are perceived as soft targets. Lets say you need to back up sensitive customer data to your cloud system. With public Internet connections, there is greater risk of intrusion. Information is passed along a route in the public Internet, and your service provider probably will not take responsibility for an intrusion that happens with another company along the way. Dedicated Ethernet connections are more secure by their nature, because that handing off of data through the public Internet doesnt happen. In the above scenario, less security means more potential liability for your company. A security incident can mean considerable expense to investigate, mitigate issues, notify customers, and potentially pay damages  not to mention a public relations nightmare in the making. Also, if your company is involved as a subcontractor to a larger organization, you may be required by contract or policy to take certain security steps, or indemnify against them. If you company is not able to meet security requirements, you may not be able to take advantage of opportunities. There was a time when setting up an Ethernet connection to the cloud would have been challenging. But today they are much less complex. You can basically outsource the private Ethernet connection. An ISP that is set up to serve business clients can deliver a more-or-less plug and play dedicated network, meeting your requirements, to connect to the cloud. You dont have to support the Ethernet connection either  ongoing support gets handled by your service provider. When your cloud assets are mission critical, reliability and availability are key issues. Ethernet is typically based on fiber and can be switched to a redundant path almost instantly, eliminating interruptions. Public Internet connections cant guarantee that your systems will be available consistently with the level of performance needed. With a dedicated Ethernet network, your offsite cloud data and applications can offer the same level of performance as if they were located within your local are network, but still maintaining the advantages of cloud computing.","In September Google in its effort to create a Web page for every business on the Web (and, of course, take away a little steam from Yelp). Last week they offered up to help make the service a bit more interactive and useful for users and business owners. The new features also give SMB owners yet another reason to claim both their Google Local Business Listing AND their Google Place Page.  Its just one big ball of Google rolling out of Mountain View. First, the two additions. Business owners who claim their listing through the Local Business Center will be able to post short updates on their pages directly through their LBC dashboard.  Consider it another Twitter feed that will show up directly on your Place page. This will give you the opportunity to post about upcoming events, let customers know whats fresh out of the oven, offer daily coupons, etc.   Its a strong sign to your community that your page is up to date and that youve had a hand in creating it.  It helps them to trust the information that theyre reading. To add extra cred and authority to their Google Place Page, business owners can claim their listings and receive a badge they can place on their page to tell customers that the listing has been verified. It will look something like this: While both features are certainly helpful new additions, theyre a little underwhelming. If Google created Place Pages as a way to compete with Yelp and become the go-to hub for local businesses, then they should really be looking for ways to open up the walls and let SMB owners use these Place Pages as a way to aggregate all of their information. Instead of letting them post updates from the LBC, let them integrate Twitter right onto the page.  Why give them double work? Let them bring in their Yelp listings so customers dont even have to visit the site. Let them post pictures from Picasa or Flickr.  Google should be looking for ways to make Place pages branded portal pages that SMB owners can build out and control. Matt McGee posted his comments on the new features in a post entitled and lists off 7 ways he thinks Google could improve the pages.  I think Google would be wise to heed some of his advice because he outlines the exact direction that these pages should be going. If you want SMB owners to claim their listings and to start looking as Google as a centralized place to house their information, then Google needs to start breaking down the walls to allow them to that.  Let them use third-party widgets to highlight where they live elsewhere on the Web. Import reviews.  Turn these Place Pages into business hubs.  Not only are you going to encourage SMBs owners to claim their pages, but youre also going to get customers into the habit of checking for these pages the way they do right now for Yelp. And isnt that the point? To make Place Pages the Wikipedia of the SMB world? While the new additions to Place Pages are helpful, theyre pretty unremarkable.","Last year, I wrote a post that used data from the Center for Venture Research (CVR) at the University of New Hampshire to explore since the financial crisis and Great Recession. Now that the CVR has released its activity in the United States, I am updating that analysis. The twitter length message is this: The number of angels and angel-backed companies has risen, but investment dollars have fallen, driving down the size of the average investment. More Americans made angel investments last year than in 2007. The CVR estimates that the number of angels increased by 16 percent between 2007 and 2013. Thats considerably faster than the 5 percent increase in the population that the U.S. Census Bureau reports. The value of angel investment has fallen in inflation-adjusted terms. In 2007, angels put $27.3 billion (in 2010 dollars) into young companies. In 2013, they invested $23.2 billion. The decline occurred primarily during the economic downturn. The amount of investment dropped from $27.3 billion to $18 billion (in 2010 dollars) between 2007 and 2009. Since 2009, it has risen slowly. The number of angel-backed ventures has increased. CVR data indicate that the number of companies receiving money from business angels rose from 57,120 in 2007 to 70,730 in 2013, a 24 percent increase. That rise is significant, given that most estimates show that the number of startup companies stagnated or declined over the same period. The size of the average angel investment has shrunk. The CVR figures show that the average investment was $477,000 (in 2010 dollars) in 2007. In 2013, it was $328,000, nearly one-third less than it was in the last year before the Great Recession. Changes in angels preferences for stage of investment and industry may account for some of the decline in the size of the average investment. In 2007, 39 percent of the angel investments were at the seed and startup stage. In 2013 that figure was 45 percent. The industry distribution of funded companies also changed between 2007 and 2013. Media deals increased from 5 percent of the total in 2007 to 16 percent in 2013. Industrial and energy deals went from 8 percent of the total to zero, while financial services deals rose from zero to 7 percent. Another big change between 2007 and 2013 was a rise in the yield rate  the percentage of pitched opportunities that result in actual investments. At 14 percent in 2007, the figure reached 22 percent in 2013. The rise in the yield might be a cause or an effect of the decline in the average deal size. Investors might like more deals than they used to, leading them to spread their money around more businesses. Alternatively, investors might be making smaller investments allowing more of the deals they see to pass muster. The CVR does not provide pre-recession data on valuation. But in 2013, the average deal was valued at $2.8 million, with angels taking an average of 1/8 of the companies shares in return for their money. The 2013 data doesnt significantly change the post-Great Recession patterns in angel investments shown in the CVR data. The number of angels and angel-backed companies has risen, but amount of money invested has declined. The primary change is a significantly smaller average investment in 2013 than in 2007.","The highlight of my mailbox a few weeks ago was a review copy of by Judy Hoberman. When I opened the first pages, the highlight to bring me further into the text was a paragraph regarding a significant challenge that saleswomen face. Its a issue that is sometimes debated when discussing diversity and professional development  being provided outdated tools while setting objectives to be successful. More women are entering the sales ranks. But some of the glass ceiling issues that occur in corporate America exists for professional sales as well. Hoberman, a sales strategy consultant based near Houston, Texas, crafted a short book meant to challenge those notions through accessible suggestions. It speaks to managers looking to expand their communication style to saleswomen, as well as to saleswomen looking to leverage their skillset. has the same size and scope as , a concise human resources book for specific issues with disabled people. Its concise approach means inserting skirt tips  notes in each chapter meant to crystalize the point  and chapters grouped into three segments on culture, understanding the differences, and professional development beyond sales into management. The reminders are light but serious notes regarding how to train women to their strengths. One example notes how competition is approached, leading to better ways to train salespeople. As you read Hoberman words, youll gain more insight as to how her tips lead to bottom line impact. Her goal for your organization is to create processes that enhance strengths for all. Its the authors approach that closes the deal for this books capacity to aid your sales team. She wants you to understand why  When suggesting open-ended questions, Hoberman notes a few examples: What are your biggest concerns? What features are on your must-have list? Then she reviews the nuances of listening needed to make open-ended questions an opportunity to connect with leads. Those who love deep research wont find a ton of stats and footnotes, although a few chapters like New Era offer sources for notes regarding womens financial clout in the marketplace. The stats do help to raise the points Hoberman notes on communication style as well as what is at stake economically for businesses to survive.  The stats mentioned are used wisely, with no sense of overselling or blatant bias just to make a point. Hobermans insight and professional wisdom comes through on the pages, yet deftly avoids overdone claims of self-success that plaque overhyped guru books. This book focuses on sales, but lets face it. If you call yourself an entrepreneur, sales is the invisible syllable in that word. You will find a terrific guide that makes sales feel more real to entrepreneurs as much as it does for experienced sales teams.

It will compliment books like with ease. Keep this guide at your ready access, and with each read you will see how your sales will become meaningful activity.","Google announced its plans for Android Wear recently. The adaptation of the companys popular mobile operating system will allow it to be used for a variety of wearable technology including watches. In a post on the Google Official Blog, Sundar Pichai, Senior Vice President of Android, Chrome and Apps : Google says it is working with watch and consumer electronic makers to develop new devices that operate on the Android Wear system, including Asus, HTC, LG, Motorola, and Fossil Group, among others. The company says some of these watches will be available later this year. For small business owners and entrepreneurs, the new adapted operating system could create several opportunities. Like other smart wearable devices, watches powered by Android Wear will give you basic information like time and weather. They will also sync with your smartphone to deliver notifications like texts and emails. A demo video shows users able to connect with their Google contacts via Hangouts, too. All of it will happen on a full-color face plate on the watch. Devices powered by Android Wear will allow you to keep your smartphone stowed away safely while still letting you keep in contact and get vital information. Youll even send texts, make calls, and send Hangouts messages from your smart watch. Android Wear will also enable voice search features. By simply saying OK, Google users will be able to get information based on their location  like location about nearby businesses, flight and travel information, or just general news updates on topics important to them. For small app developers, Google has already opened a of the Android Wear system. The system preview will also allow developers to create new apps specific for Android Wear devices. Later this year, Google will unveil Android Wear SDK to allow developers to create more customized experiences for users of smart wearable devices.","More and more, people are turning away from TV, and towards YouTube for entertainment, education and information. And many YouTube channels boast having more than one million subscribers  even if they arent movie stars, rock stars or famous athletes. Jonathan Davids, founder of influencer marketing platform , shares his thoughts on the importance of leveraging the growing influence of YouTube content creators. Davids talks about engaging YouTube stars to connect with prospects and customers. My first real business was right in the middle of university. I launched a lifestyle e-mag targeted towards women, and built up a really big audience on that site. It was a display-advertising driven business and we had a contents indication side of it. I sold that business in 2009, and then I got into the YouTube marketing world around 2011, and boy has it just blown up over the last few years. Essentially its an ad-tech platform. Brands or ad agencies or media buyers are used to buying media and ad space in a very scientific way, and when it comes to blogger outreach or influencer marketing, its been really a mish-mash of kind of who you know, who do I know, over the last few years. Were trying to embed a bit of science into that. Using our platform, a media buyer or a brand directly would log in, put in the filters of exactly what type of audience theyre trying to reach, what their budget is, what the creative output is, and all that kind of stuff and we will programmatically tell them, okay, here are the top 100 influencers on YouTube or Twitter or Instagram that are perfect for your brand. And we take them through that entire process of working with them. That stat that you just rang off, thats one number and there are lots of stats just like that. The number that I always use is, effectively YouTube reaches a billion people every single month and you know, the number of video views and comments and engagements that take place on YouTube are well into the hundreds of billions. The other side of it is, theres this entire democratization of who can work with, YouTube in this case, or the other networks. Whereas you want to do a buy on a broadcast network, you need to have millions of dollars to do that. But with the right YouTube content creator that reaches your consumer audience, even a small marketing agency or a small brand thats regional or local in focus can find the exact content creator thats going to speak to their audience and get your product out there. Exactly, and thats the biggest shift. Essentially if youre picking from a population of movie stars, TV stars, recording stars, theres only going to be a couple dozen in each of those categories who are really viable candidates. When youre talking about, I want to find a YouTube star who talks about food and dining lets say, and I want somebody who has an audience over 100,000 people, the number of options you have there, again is enormous. Youre talking 10,000 plus people who would fit that category. And then the other side of it is, you dont even need to worry about household names. We just signed a young lady for example, shes working on the back-to-school campaign for one of our big retail clients and the brief that the client gave us was, we want to find someone whos very influential in music among other things. So we found this girl. She has 1.3 million subscribers on YouTube who tune in every week for a new music video that she does, usually cover songs. Absolutely. Its completely transparent. You can see everything from the number of subscribers, to what are her average video views. Exactly. We launched our brand new platform at Influicity.com about three months ago, and originally our target was the clients that we had already been working with  big retailers, big consumer packaged goods companies across North America. But we realized we were getting a lot of requests from content companies and small agencies and small media-buying companies, 5, 10 employees. The real need there was if youre a 5-person shop, an ad agency, you dont really want to waste time going through mounds and mounds of potential influencers or bloggers you could work with. You could really save your time and improve your efficiency through a platform that actually finds those influencers for you.","Attention all business owners and marketers! Its planning season!

The first thing I noticed when I opened the book was the slew of smartly written accolades from a variety of folks that span a wide variety of industries and disciplines  one even came from a military strategist! Im not one to be swayed by the testimonials I see in a book because so many of them are rather general and just say that the book is the greatest thing since sliced bread. But the testimonials and recommendations from are very specific. So much so, that they almost read like the menu at a gourmet restaurant. I couldnt wait to see what these folks were talking about. McKeown hits on the biggest issue that surrounds strategy  no one really knows what it is or how it works. If we did  he probably wouldnt need to write such a comprehensive book that simplifies that topic in a way that is accessible and practical for readers at any level or business education and experience. Its clear that the focus of is on the reader and your ability to apply the principles. McKeown accomplishes this in three practical and important ways; Max McKeown isnt new to strategies or writing books.

A recent survey shows small lenders already grant more than half of small business loans. And last month, approval rates jumped again to 51.6 percent from 51.1 percent in April. Rohit Arora, CEO of Biz2Credit, an online lending marketplace, explains: The results were part of the May 2014 , a monthly survey of 1,000 loan applications on Biz2Credit. The survey showed small banks continue to issue a larger share of small business loans than even their larger competitors. However, large banks with over $10 million in assets also saw an increase in lending last month and now approve almost one out of every five small business funding requests, the survey says. Arora added: It seemed the only category to continue to see a decrease was alternative lending including cash advance companies. This group of lenders saw its sixth consecutive decrease in Mays survey as the economy improved and more qualified small businesses sought banks or institutional lenders with better interest rates. Arora said: Credit unions and institutional lenders also continued to see increases in lending approvals, the survey said.","Heres some good and bad tax news for owners of Subchapter S-Corporations. The good news is that your chances of getting audited remained low last tax year, and are not expected to increase this year. That should be some solace for tax-compliant small business owners concerned about unnecessary examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The bad news is that the majority of those burdened by examination will likely be compliant taxpayers who shouldnt have been bothered by the IRS. So much for the solace. By historical standards, S-Corp audit rates are low. The IRS examined 0.42 percent of S-corporations (either through correspondence or in person) in tax year 2013, down slightly from 0.48 percent the year before, the tax authority (PDF) recently. The S-Corp examination rate has been largely flat in recent years, after rising from a low of 0.19 percent in 2004 to 0.45 percent in 2007. However, between 1998 and 2004, the fraction of S-Corps audited by the IRS dropped by more than 80 percent, as the figure below shows. Though he was speaking about tax filers in general and not specifically about S-Corp owners, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said that current audit rates are too low. Any further declines, he believes, would undermine Americans faith in the tax agencys ability to ensure voluntary compliance with tax laws. Mr. Koskinen blames a lack of money for the low number of taxpayers his agency has examined in recent years, (PDF) that tight budget constraints have eroded the examination staff available to conduct audits. He is asking legislators for more money to examine filers. His agencys (PDF) calls for an 11.1 percent hike in funds for enforcement  a hefty rise in a time of low inflation. While the commissioner might be right that the IRS needs more money to ensure compliance with tax laws in general, thats less likely to be the case for S-corporation owners. Either those owners are choosing to comply with tax requirements voluntarily, in spite of the low audit rate, or the tax agency has little idea which owners to target for unpaid taxes. A 2012 Report of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (PDF) that more than six of every 10 S-corporation audits selected by the agencys Discriminant Index Function  a computer algorithm that identifies taxpayers likely to be underreporting income  resulted in no additional tax owed. That means that most of the time the IRS audits Sub Chapter S corporations, it is bothering compliant taxpayers with unnecessary investigation. Figuring out whether the IRS should increase S-Corp audit rates and get them closer to late-1990s levels, or leave them where they are, is important. The share of small business activity organized through S-corporations has risen substantially in recent decades, growing from seven percent in 1980 to 34 percent in 2008, (PDF).","I suppose you can say that Im in the No B.S. frame of mind these days.

But Bank of America is still the only one that has forsworn arbitrary interest rate increases on existing balances. That means the who use credit cards for financing purposes each year will need to get a bit creative if they want to attain debt stability as well as the best combination of product terms possible. You basically have two options. First of all, you could use a card like the Bank of America Cash Rewards for Business MasterCard, which offers 0% interest for 9 months in addition to 3% cash back on purchases made at office supply stores and gas stations, 2% cash back at restaurants and 1% on everything else. Alternatively, you could implement the Island Approach. The Island Approach to credit card use is a strategy that entails using separate accounts for different types of transactions and needs. In general, this might involve a small business owner using a base rewards card for everyday spending, a 0% general-consumer credit card for financing stability, and perhaps a card offering an attractive initial bonus in order to cushion your coffers. More specifically and with currently available offers in mind, the Island Approach could look something like this: Citi Diamond Rewards Card: This card offers 0% on purchases as well as balance transfers for 18 months and does not charge an annual fee. It does, however, have a 3% balance transfer fee, so its best used to finance upcoming big-ticket purchases. Slate Card from Chase: A free balance transfer credit card, Slate offers 0% interest on transferred debt for the first 15 months and does not charge either an annual fee or a balance transfer fee. For the average consumer with about $6,500 in credit card debt, transferring that balance to the Slate Card from a card with a 17% interest rate and paying it down within 24 months would be worth more than $1,000 in avoided finance charges. Capital One Spark Cash for Business: This card offers a full 2% cash back on all purchases, with no rotating spending categories, earnings limits, or other caveats. You also stand to get a $100 initial rewards bonus for spending at least $1,000 during the first three months and another $50 for signing up an employee as an authorized user. There is no annual fee during the first year ($59 beginning in year two). Ink Plus Business Card: The 50,000 bonus points youll get from Chase for spending at least $5,000 during the first three months are redeemable for a $500 statement credit or $625 in travel booked through the Ultimate Rewards program. The Ink Plus Card also offers 5 points per dollar on up to $50,000 in annual office supply and telecom purchases as well as 2 points per dollar on $50,000 in annual gas and hotel expenses. There is no annual fee during the first year ($95 thereafter). Business Rewards Card: This card offers up to 85,000 bonus points  50,000 after your first purchase and 35,000 for charging $2,500 during the first 90 days. Those points are redeemable for up to 18 free nights at hotel chains like Radisson and Country Inn & Suites. While any small business would benefit from 0% rates and hundreds of dollars in rewards bounties, the best offers are only available to people with above-average personal credit standing. Creditors consider small businesses to be extensions of their owners and evaluate the personal finances of small business credit card applicants as a result. Should you therefore need to do a bit of credit building prior to revamping your suite of small business spending tools, get a credit card with no annual fee. It will report information to the major credit bureaus on a monthly basis and wont cause you to waste money on service charges as you climb back to good credit. Like paying down debt or , credit building is one of those things that isnt terribly easy or exciting. But its important, and if you take care of it now, you, your wallet and your company will all be happy later.","Just because youre working hard on those doesnt mean youre not still doing cool things the Web. You still have your meet ups, your local events, your community gatherings, your sponsorships and, of course, youre still the resident browner baker for your school district. So why not get the best of both worlds by using the Web to help you promote not only what youre doing online, but what youre doing , as well? Have a local event, training or meet up you want to spread the word about? Here are six ways to use the Internet to your advantage. One of the most effective ways to promote an offline event on the Web is to start early and build that first touch of buzz. Maybe its a blog post announcing a conference youll be speaking at or its some early photos as you prepare for your company birthday party or photos of a product you currently have in development. By using social media outlets like your blog, Facebook, Tumblr, etc, to tease people about whats coming down the pipeline you build awareness for whats happening offline and create that initial excitement. Its that first spark of interest thats going to make someone want to tune in or show up in person to see what the commotion is all about. If its an offline event, why not make it a Facebook event? Small business owners can create Facebook events around product releases, community events, things happening in-store, and anything else. By doing so you give people a place to gather and talk about whats going on. Youre able to share information with your audience, take advantage of targeted Facebook advertising, and it can be used to incent others to promote your event in their own networks. After the event, you can also send a call-to-action encouraging users to upload media (photos, videos) from the event that you can host on your Facebook page. In the weeks leading up to your event make sure you dedicate some time to blogging about it. Announce the event, talk about what youre doing to prepare, host some giveaways or special offers that will be taking place at the event, etc. Blogging about what youre doing can help get the word out and it also gives people in your community something they can share to encourage their friends to come out, as well. A hashtag is a symbol used to group or mark related information on Twitter. Hashtags are often created by topic (#business) or by event (#blogworld) to help people find the information theyre after or to associate themselves with something thats happening on a larger scale. For example, is an affiliate marketing conference that just took place in Las Vegas earlier this week. Attendees of the conference used the hashtag to talk about what they learned, get information from sessions they werent at, or just to meet up at the networking events. Trying to get people talking about an event youre creating or are part of? Assign it a hashtag and encourage people to use it when talking about the event. Twitter is a great way to connect with people online about your offline event, both before, after and during! Just because the event is taking place offline doesnt mean you cant let people sign up and tell everyone theyre coming via online channels. Use a site like to create an online registration page that you can share, promote, and drive traffic to. Creating this page will also allow others to see who ELSE is attending and give you some social proof to drum up registrations. Video is another great way to spark buzz about your event. You can create a video of yourself talking about whats coming up, film the preparations or even encourage attendees to upload videos talking about why theyre so excited about your event. This gives people something to share and produces a different type of content you can put on your site and show off to visitors. Theres no shortage of ways small business owners can use the Web to promote offline events. And the earlier you start, the more time youll have to","Arjun Arora, creator of , which presents highly targeted ads to consumers, moved on quickly after selling his six-year-old startup this past March.And now a new app called ishis new gig. The Immediately app is designed to integrate deeply with Gmail and Salesforce to help salespeople better manage their workflow. It does so by providing the ability to monitor leads and log phone calls. It also notifies users when recipients open emails, among other things. The startup is located at 2 Mint Plaza in San Francisco. I joined as a late co-founder, Arora told Small Business Trends in an exclusive interview. He first met co-founders CTO James Mock and CEO Branko Cerny in October 2013 when the two were just starting out. Two brilliant young first-time founders had gotten the company to a great place and it made sense for me to join and help take the company to a new level, he said.When I was ready to get back into operating I happened to reconnect and it all made sense. Mock and Branko initially focused their efforts on an email organizer app but later decided to focus specifically on sales with Immediately. The platform aims for nothing less than to replace the CRM concept with a mobile program that is data-driven and highly automated. Its deeply invested in becoming the one product that a sales rep wants to use day in and day out, Arora on Immediatelys website. Noting that more than 70percentof lost deals happen due to slow reaction time, the program aims to fix that by freeing up salespeople to focus more on the selling process itself. The Immediately app hasgotten kudos from the likes of Peter Kazanjy, Monsters Vice President of Products and Technology, who : The Immediately app has also gotten funding. Cofounder Cerny TechCrunch that Immediately had raised $2 million in funding and was working with pilot customers, including Tapsense, UserVoice, NatureBox, Spark Central, New Relic and ZenPayroll. Immediatelys investors include Streamlined Ventures, Maiden Lane, Galvanize VC, Queensbridge, Friendster and Nuzzel founder Jonathan Abrams, TalentBin co-founder Peter Kazanjy, EdgeSpring co-founder Ryan Lange, and HootSuite CEO Ryan Holmes. Aroras earlier company ReTargeter was purchased for an undisclosed price in late March by Sellpoints, which distributes media content for manufacturers. It started as a business partnership and turned into an acquisition, Arora told Small Business Trends. It started as a solution that their clients could use and to help them win more business and then turn it into an acquisition. The acquisition benefits SellPoints by enabling it to combine its massive collection of consumer data with ReTargeters ad network to bolster and expand efforts to reach online shoppers.","NEW DELHI: futures fell by Rs 20 to Rs 2,790 per barrel today as speculators cut down their bets amid weak cues from the Asian . At the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for delivery in August was trading lower by Rs 20, or 0.71 per cent, to Rs 2,790 per barrel in 1,673 lots. On similar lines, crude for delivery in far-month September fell by Rs 19, or 0.66 per cent, to Rs 2,856 per barrel, in a business volume of 70 lots. Analysts said trading sentiment remained weak after oil prices fell in Asia on profit-taking following two days of gains, with concerns about a global oversupply keeping optimism in check. The losses come despite a rally across stock markets after the announced an interest rate cut - the first since 2009 - and surprise stimulus to shore up the after Britain's vote to leave the EU. Globally, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was down 36 cents, or 0.83 per cent, to $41.57 a barrel, while Brent was 40 cents, or 0.90 per cent, to $43.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices dropped below $ 40 a barrel on Monday, the first time since April.","The British had a ruthless economic agenda when it came to operating in India and that did not include empathy for native citizens. Under the British Raj, India suffered countless famines. But the worst hit was Bengal. The first of these was in 1770, followed by severe ones in 1783, 1866, 1873, 1892, 1897 and lastly 1943-44. Previously, when famines had hit the country, indigenous rulers were quick with useful responses to avert major disasters. After the advent of the British, most of the famines were a consequence of monsoonal delays along with the exploitation of the countrys natural resources by the British for their own financial gain. Yet they did little to acknowledge the havoc these actions wrought. If anything, they were irritated at the inconveniences in taxing the famines brought about. The first of these famines was in 1770 and was ghastly brutal. The first signs indicating the coming of such a huge famine manifested in 1769 and the famine itself went on till 1773. It killed approximately 10 million people, millions more than the Jews incarcerated during the Second World War. It wiped out one third the population of Bengal. John Fiske, in his book The Unseen World, wrote that the famine of 1770 in Bengal was far deadlier than the Black Plague that terrorized Europe in the fourteenth century. Under the Mughal rule, peasants were required to pay a tribute of 10-15 per cent of their cash harvest. This ensured a comfortable treasury for the rulers and a wide net of safety for the peasants in case the weather did not hold for future harvests. In 1765 the Treaty of Allahabad was signed and East India Company took over the task of collecting the tributes from the then Mughal emperor Shah Alam II. Overnight the tributes, the British insisted on calling them tributes and not taxes for reasons of suppressing rebellion, increased to 50 percent. The peasants were not even aware that the money had changed hands. They paid, still believing that it went to the Emperor. Partial failure of crop was quite a regular occurrence in the Indian peasants life. That is why the surplus stock, which remained after paying the tributes, was so important to their livelihood. But with the increased taxation, this surplus deteriorated rapidly. When partial failure of crops came in 1768, this safety net was no longer in place. The rains of 1769 were dismal and herein the first signs of the terrible draught began to appear. The famine occurred mainly in the modern states of West Bengal and Bihar but also hit Orissa, Jharkhand and Bangladesh. Bengal was, of course, the worst hit. Among the worst affected areas were Birbum and Murshidabad in Bengal. Thousands depopulated the area in hopes of finding sustenance elsewhere, only to die of starvation later on. Those who stayed on perished nonetheless. Huge acres of farmland were abandoned. Wilderness started to thrive here, resulting in deep and inhabitable jungle areas. Tirhut, Champaran and Bettiah in Bihar were similarly affected in Bihar. Prior to this, whenever the possibility of a famine had emerged, the Indian rulers would waive their taxes and see compensatory measures, such as irrigation, instituted to provide as much relief as possible to the stricken farmers. The colonial rulers continued to ignore any warnings that came their way regarding the famine, although starvation had set in from early 1770. Then the deaths started in 1771. That year, the company raised the land tax to 60 per cent in order to recompense themselves for the lost lives of so many peasants. Fewer peasants resulted in less crops that in turn meant less revenue. Hence the ones who did not yet succumb to the famine had to pay double the tax so as to ensure that the British treasury did not suffer any losses during this travesty. After taking over from the Mughal rulers, the British had issued widespread orders for cash crops to be cultivated. These were intended to be exported. Thus farmers who were used to growing paddy and vegetables were now being forced to cultivate indigo, poppy and other such items that yielded a high market value for them but could be of no relief to a population starved of food. There was no backup of edible crops in case of a famine. The natural causes that had contributed to the draught were commonplace. It was the single minded motive for profit that wrought about the devastating consequences. No relief measure was provided for those affected. Rather, as mentioned above, taxation was increased to make up for any shortfall in revenue. What is more ironic is that the East India Company generated a profited higher in 1771 than they did in 1768.  Although the starved populace of Bengal did not know it yet, this was just the first of the umpteen famines, caused solely by the motive for profit, that was to slash across the country side. Although all these massacres were deadly in their own right, the deadliest one to occur after 1771 was in 1943 when three million people died and others resorted to eating grass and human flesh in order to survive. Winston Churchill, the hallowed British War prime minister who saved Europe from a monster like Hitler was disturbingly callous about the roaring famine that was swallowing Bengals population. He casually diverted the supplies of medical aid and food that was being dispatched to the starving victims to the already well supplied soldiers of Europe. When entreated upon he said, Famine or no famine, Indians will breed like rabbits. The Delhi Government sent a telegram painting to him a picture of the horrible devastation and the number of people who had died. His only response was, Then why hasnt Gandhi died yet?""       This Independence Day it is worthwhile to remember that the riches of the west were built on the graves of the East. While we honour the brave freedom fighters (as we should), it is victims like these, the ones sacrificed without a moments thought, who paid the ultimate price. Shed a tear in their memory and strive to make the most of this hard won independence that we take for granted today. Pledge to stand up those whose voice the world refuses to hear because they are too lowly to matter. To be free is a great privilege. But as a great superhero once said, With great freedom comes great responsibility.","Facebook announced on Wednesday that the number of users of its Messenger application had topped one billion, a key milestone as it seeks to expand the platform to new services. The growth in Messenger gives greater reach to Facebook, which is moving to create a family of applications beyond the social network. said Facebook Vice-President David Marcus in a statement. He added,We remain focused on helping connect people to the people and businesses who matter most. Facebook itself has more than 1.6 billion users, and WhatsApp, another messaging application acquired by Facebook for some $20 billion in 2014, also counts more than a billion users. Other services in the Facebook family include Instagram, which more than 500 million use to share images, and Oculus, which makes virtual reality gear. Marcus told AFP that Messengers key markets include North America, Australia, Britain, France, the Philippines, Thailand, and several other European countries. Facebook has been moving to make Messenger a platform with other services such as bots that deliver news or connect with retailers or other businesses, for example. Marcus said Messenger has some 18,000 active bots and continues to expand the platform. Messenger can help monetisation because it keeps users in the Facebook ecosystem where they can be targeted with ads. ""We will see that happens in the coming months, but I think that once you have an ecosystem that starts working between businesses and so many users on Messenger, we'll find more monetisation vectors in the future,"" Marcus said, adding,""But we aren't at the stage where we are rushing to monetise."" WhatsApp, which is managed independently, does not accept advertising but is exploring ways to allow businesses to use it to connect with customers. According to the company, Messenger is the second most popular application in Apple's iOS system behind Facebook itself. Facebook said more than 17 billion photos are sent to friends through Messenger every month and that Messenger users have played 1.2 billion games of virtual basketball.","When your business receives a complaint through the Better Business Bureau, it can really harm your reputation. Complaints are not only publicly available, but they also impact your overall rating. Its an issue that affects a lot of businesses. In 2013, Better Business Bureaus in the U.S. and Canada handled 918,695 complaints. The Akron, OH branch alone processes about 4,500 complaints annually. Sandy Gamby, director of operations for explained when and why complaints are a big deal for businesses in a phone interview with Small Business Trends: Small businesses, in particular, can see their ratings suffer from complaints, since it will take fewer unhappy customers speaking up to cause an impact. Complaints stay on a companys record for three years, so avoiding them whenever possible is crucial. But if you do receive them, there are some things you can do to minimize the damage and try to avoid causing any more of it. Complaints should never go unanswered, according to Gamby. The BBB recommends that all businesses, both BBB accredited and non-BBB accredited, should respond as soon as possible. If a BBB accredited business is unable to respond within 10 business days for any reason, Gamby said they should reach out to their local branch to explain the reason. Otherwise, the complaint will go on record as unanswered, showing the businesses didnt successfully address the issue, resulting in a ratings drop. In your response, the BBB recommends addressing each issue that the customer has brought up. Gamby also said that the business should stay fair and reasonable, acknowledge the experience that the customer had, and stick to the facts. If the customers story doesnt match with the real experience they had, try to provide some documentation that supports your side of the story. This may not always be possible, but it can add some credibility to your brand since the BBBs complaints and resolutions are publicly available. Oftentimes, Gamby said, customers reach out to the businesses themselves before filing a complaint with the BBB. When this happens, she said businesses should try their very best to resolve the problem so that it doesnt escalate to a complaint. Sometimes customers are just seeking acknowledgement and an apology. Other times, a refund or other resolution might be in order. But taking action before a complaint can often help businesses avoid the situation altogether. One of the ways businesses can avoid negative feedback is by having clear contracts with their clients and customers. If people know exactly what they should expect from you, they will be less likely to have inflated expectations that will cause them to complain later. The BBB will even review contracts for their members to ensure that they are sound, and thus less likely to cause problems later. There are other, common sense steps businesses can take to avoid complaints. Gamby said that business owners and representatives should always show up on time, treat people with respect and courtesy, and make sure that customer service is a top priority. Showing simple respect for customers and clients can eliminate quite a few potential complaints. The BBB also gives customers the opportunity to post reviews on their website. They are different from complaints since those can impact a businesss BBB rating. But for all to see. Businesses still have the opportunity to respond to their negative reviews, and Gamby said they should definitely try to do so whenever possible. However, balancing these out with positive feedback goes a long way to presenting a more balanced view of your business. The Akron branch sees about two-thirds positive reviews and just about a third negative. So encourage happy customers to speak up and you can boost your companys reputation even further.","As content marketing increasingly becomes the standard avenue for building trust and gaining credibility with customers, your website is going to have to keep up with the trend. Heavy-handed and salesy strategies that may have worked a few years ago in order to get email opt-ins or conversions just arent going to cut it anymore. Consumers are looking for someone they can trust  period. And trust isnt something you can fake. So for business owners and marketers looking to succeed in this age of inbound marketing, having a website that conveys trustworthiness, credibility and authenticity is going to be paramount. So how do you do this? How do you make sure your website stand out among less credible resources online? Lets face it, your businesss biggest asset is you.

Dont assume that your audience demands your personal involvement in all areas of your content marketing such as emails, blog posts and social media updates. Most will understand that you simply dont have time to do it all. If you have staff to perform these functions for you, be transparent by having them include their names and credentials. Offering social proof on your website is a not-so-subtle way of saying, Hey, others like me, why dont you? Help alleviate fears your website visitors may have about connecting with you by showing that others have done it before. You can include social proof on your site by using social media counters, showing the number of email subscribers you have or by displaying verifiable testimonials. There are obviously some sites and types of content that are, by their very nature, timely and up-to-date (think news sites, travel booking sites, shopping sites, etc.). But if its not immediately obvious that your content is fresh and timely, without even realizing it. Make sure your blog posts are dated, and that any newsy type content is clearly labeled as current. Of course, if youre not regularly updating your website, this is going to hurt your credibility, so be aware of this up front. Whether you have an eCommerce site, a content-based site or a site that simply represents your online and/or brick and mortar business, be clear and transparent about the purpose of your site and any potential conflicts of interest that could arise. For instance, if the ultimate goal of your website is to sell your web design services, dont masquerade your site as something else. Be up front about what you do, why youre doing it and if or how your content may be affected. In a time where content needs to be reliable and authentic in order to stand out from the pack, content marketers are going to need to be diligent about conveying this credibility to their website visitors. By following the general rule of being clear and transparent about all aspects of your site and business, youll be well on your way to gaining the trust and respect of your website visitors both now, and in the future.

Giles House, SVP/CMO of sales and marketing effectiveness platform CallidusCloud, joins us to talk about what he calls the most important cloud to business people: The Lead-to-Money Cloud. He describes what the Lead-to-Money cloud is, how it helps align marketing and sales to the needs of customers  current and prospective, and how it should build a more efficient platform for customer engagement. * * * * * Ive been in software for a good ten years. Spent all my life in it, in my professional capacity of course. Joined SAP and spent five years there in sales, pre-sales and business development. Were an enterprise SaaS company. Our focus is on helping sales people, and the marketing teams as well, close more deals faster. We want to get more deals, bigger deals, and do it as easily as we can. Essentially, its a process. To acquire a new customer starts with mining all that intelligence of what theyre doing on your website and how theyre responding to your marketing campaigns. How do we execute those campaigns more efficiently, get better quality leads, get more intelligence out of our website (often a neglected resource for companies)? But its their shop window, so you have to be able to track all those anonymous visitors. Something like 90% of your traffic can be anonymous, so thats a huge amount of traffic youre losing insight from. So we have to sort that out, and thats something we do. Then its really abouthow does marketing enable the sales force? Having the sales people being able to go into the portal, look at what content they should be using based on where they are in the sales cycle, where the buyer is, etc. I think it was Forrester who published a survey last year of B2B buyers globally, and said something like only one in five meetings with a buyer resulted in a successful follow-up meeting. So four out of the five meetings with the sales person were useless and of no value. So theres a sort of performance angle. How do we get the sales people to be better? But theres also an effectiveness angle. Think of it as lets remove friction from the process. Were trying to change the way sales and marketing teams behave. It feels like it should be a non-issue because Ive spent time in the field and now Im in marketing, so Ive got that perspective. But a lot of people havent got that perspective, and sales cast their aspersions on the effectiveness of the marketing team, and vice versa. Yeah, better leads. Its a well-trodden path, but what we believe is sales and marketing have to be joined at the hip. Back to the Forrester survey  one in five meetings was successful. If we take our company, for example, we have our lead-to-money suite and in that, there are eight different products, lets say. If you come to our website, and youve just watched our overview video. And then youve filled in a form to download our lead-to-money white paper. And then my sales development team calls you, with just that knowledge theyre not going to be prepared to go into any kind of detail on any of those areas. Theyre not going to have a clue what youre interested in. But if that inside sales person knows, for example, that youve not only filled in this form. But all that anonymous browsing you were doing before that, where you spent 2 minutes 36 seconds on the configure price quote page, and then spent 2 minutes watching the configure price quote overview demo video, then that sales persons got a much better idea that what youre really interested in is a configure price quote. Marketing captures that information, but doesnt always get it to the sales person. So we have these lead alerts that go out to all the sales force, exec team, marketing team, etc. And the sales guys can also set up their own individual alerts. So if any of their accounts are on the website looking at anything, theyll get that intelligence in real time. The overriding thing is, think about the customer experience. The first part of the customer experience is that first date, when you speak to a sales person. Theyre your first representative. Now if that sales person doesnt do a good job of articulating the value proposition, or worse still, is trying to talk to you about something that youre not even interested in, or theyre trying to talk to you about something that youve already bought from them, that is a dreadful experience. Yes. And I can tell you, Ive had vendors who want to sell to us, running lead-gen programs who were already working with, telling me why I should be working with them. Guess what happens when that contracts up for renewal? Youre not going to renew it. Im not doing a renewal because its a bad experience. It leads me to believe that if they havent got a handle on me as their client, then how on earth are they going to do a good job for me elsewhere? Easiest way is . Weve got videos, white papers, content galore.","When you once were called the Social Media Swami, what might a logical next career step be? For Shashi Bellamkonda, that next career step is to become a Chief Marketing Officer. Bellamkonda joins starting April 1. He will be the new CMO of the technology and services provider based in Herndon, Virginia. Bellamkonda is joining the management team as the company prepares to launch a new online software service called SurePulse later this summer. Chris Marentis, founder and CEO of Surefire Social, cited Bellamkondas deep experience and vision in the local marketing space as a key reason for the hire. In an official release from the company announcing Bellamkonda joining Surefire Social, Marentis says: Bellamkonda has more thana decades experience serving small businesses in the technology realm. Hemade social media history by taking on the unofficial title as the worlds first social media swami while at Network Solutions. He was among those on the forefront who foresaw social media becoming a critical channel for customer satisfaction and marketing. Today, we take it for granted that social channels like Twitter must be monitored and listened to for customer service. But it wasnt always that way. Said Bellamkonda, in an email interview with Small Business Trends: So much has changed in the last fiveyears. When writing about website trends for Small Business Trends, we stressed the importance of mobile for small business marketing. Today, that is even more important and small business should pay attention to these points to win in business. Businesses today are more localcentric, Ballamkonda says. This involves businesses being more integrated with GPS so that customers can use applications and Google searches to find local businesses, then visit the businesses with the GPS on their phone. This integration leads to action with customers. Their using mobile devicesmeans itsmore likely theyllmake quick decisions and convert due to the on-the-go nature of mobile devices, Bellamkonda adds. Business websites have become more visual and instant as mobile has changed the way we lay out websites and the way we interact with content. Everything is simpler. People are more likely to choose search results at the top of directories simply because fewer results are shown on their phone screens. Also important, Ballamkonda says, is the wisdom of strangers. Fiveyears ago, social media was still in its infancy for customer interaction, he says. Today, customers find and visit the business on mobile and then post to social media to discuss their experiences. Or, if they didnt get the kind of service they felt they deserved, demand it. All on a mobile device. Mobile social media has also led to a streaming world, Ballamkonda says. He explains, Photos, videos, and live streams are giving customers the tools they never had before. This is also an opportunity for businesses to showcase their products and services. Bellamkonda says hes excited to be returning to the world of small business. His most recent role was Vice President of Digital Marketing for a real estate firm. Surefire Social currently serves independently-owned small businesses and franchisees. The companys platform helps small businesses with their local marketing needs, including Web, mobile and social. Surefire Social was named to the Inc 500 list of fastest growing companies in the United States in 2014. Bellamkonda was twice named a Small Business Influencer Champion, in 2011 and 2012. Bellamkonda credits serendipity with how the new role came about. He was contacted through LinkedIn to recommend someone like Shashi Bellamkonda. Instead, Bellamkonda said he recommended himself.","Long gone are the days when Googling yourself was enough to monitor your .

In todays want it now, want it fast world, customer expectations are at an all-time high. Customers seem to want to stay connected to whats happening and have access to the outside world all the time, no matter where they happen to be. And a few magazines scattered on tables in the lobby are not enough anymore  people want to engage through visual technology. Thats where business TV comes in. Today, TVs serve as customer service amenities for customers and clients who have to wait, and marketing aids for visitors to your business. Televisions lend themselves as efficient and inexpensive tools for conveying information to employees. In hospitality-related businesses such as bars and restaurants, TVs can be an important part of your offering mix to draw customers, and keep them staying longer and spending more. Dollar for dollar, business television is an inexpensive marketing and customer satisfaction technique. Lets take a deeper look at key points you need to know about business TV and the role it can play in your business: There are some obvious choices for business television, and some not so obvious ones:  Bars are a natural for TVs. Sports bars, in particular, need televisions with the most up-to-date sports packages just to compete. But think outside the box. Casual restaurants, coffee shops and sandwich shops can also also benefit from television  think morning news or local programming that draws in regulars.  Business TV gives visitors the impression that your business is vibrant and connected. And for companies that use television integrally to serve clients  such as PR firms and advertising agencies  television is an important work tool.  Whether a doctor, lawyer, car repair shop or dentist, use TV as an amenity that keeps clients feeling positive even if they must wait. TV can create a welcoming environment, and reduce anxiety.  People today love to multi-task. Getting caught up on the news, watching sports or simply enjoying their favorite talk shows while they exercise, can make all the difference to those who dont like to exercise. Its an added amenity that can set your facility apart from competitors. Your cable television service provider may offer packages designed specifically for your type of business or needs. That can make your choices easier. The answer to this question depends on the type of business, the number of people watching, the setting and layout. Here are some thoughts to get you thinking: Sports bars generally need multiple large screen TVs, at least 50 inches or larger. You should have enough TVs where your patrons can watch several events from several locations. In a small business lobby or waiting room of a professional, TVs can be the same size as what youd find at home. For instance, in a doctors office with two intimate seating areas, two 32 tabletop sets may be best for patients. In the lobby of your companys offices, a single 42 wall mounted TV may suffice. When it comes to fitness centers, even small ones might have at least four wall-mounted TVs, 42 inches or bigger. For large fitness centers, the number of TVs needed could be much higher. In places with high foot traffic or lots of people, flat screen televisions mounted high up on the wall,  perhaps one in each corner  will typically be the better choice, versus set top models or a TV placed in an entertainment center. Consider traffic patterns and seating arrangements. Try to make it so that people (including wait staff) walking about do not disrupt others line of sight. And try to ensure that every seat in the house has an unimpeded view of at least one TV. In larger or unique environments, speakers and acoustics may be another consideration. Tilting helps reduce glare, and tilt mounts are necessary for higher mounting applications. Every business owner shudders to think about it, but you need to consider theft and vandalism. Wall mountings that are up high make it harder to reach TVs so they cant be accidentally broken. Some wall mounts come with the ability to lock the television to the stand with a key, making theft harder. If your place of business is compact, you may be able to install the television hardware in-house. But for larger installations, bring in a professional audio/video company to lay out where to place television sets, and get the right configurations, including mountings. Professionals also have access to a greater range of hardware than you can buy retail. Your cable TV provider can provide service packages with the correct number of TV outlets for your facility, along with suitable packages of local, news, sports and/or entertainment programming. Look for packages specifically set up for businesses similar to yours. By bundling with Internet and related services, you may be able to get additional savings. Finally, keep in mind that costs associated with business television can usually be deducted or depreciated on your business taxes. You should always consult with your own tax advisor for specific tax advice, but for general background information we reached out to , the author of JK Lassers Small Business Taxes. She says that the cost of monthly business television cable service and programming can be viewed as an ordinary and necessary business expense, which makes it deductible provided the TV service is used for business purposes. When it comes to hardware, such as television sets, she notes, Generally, the cost must be depreciated. However, the cost may qualify for the Sec. 179 deduction (up to $500,000 for 2013 as long as the business is profitable for the year) and/or bonus depreciation (50% of cost in 2013 as long as the equipment is new and not pre-owned). As you can see, there are good reasons to use TV in your business. And the cost can be affordable, especially when you factor in the potential for tax deductions and depreciation.","When the Trappist monks at St. Josephs Abbey in Massachusetts realized the jellies and jams they had been selling would soon no longer pay the bills, they needed an innovative solution. Their response was to get entrepreneurial. So they chose what might seem like an unconventional opportunity for monks: Brewing beer. Prior to opening the , the monks at St. Josephs Abbey cooked and packaged jams and jellies under the Trappist Preserves label for over 60 years. But a few years ago, the monks realized that their expenses were rising faster than their income from selling jam. One of the monks brought up brewing as a possible business. They got the blessing of the abbot and then began visiting Trappist breweries throughout Europe to gather data. Though not uncommon in other parts of the world, the result is the first brewery run by monks in the U.S. In fact, European monks have brewed beer since at least the eighth century, possibly even earlier. So it actually almost seemed like a natural fit for the monks to start this venture. It is tradition for monks to be self-supporting and to provide charitable assistance to others in the community. To do this, they normally produce their own goods and sell them to the public. So that concept isnt a new one. The brewery officially opened earlier this year. Its Spencer Trappist Ale is a full-bodied, golden hued ale with fruity accents, a dry finish and light hop bitterness, according to the brewerys website. Their beer, along with the novelty of it being the first of its kind in the country, could potentially lead to a lot of success for the monks of St. Josephs Abbey. But the monks are more worried about the impact their beer can have, both on their charitable efforts in the community and on the environment. Because of that, they make sure the brewerys practices are environmentally sustainable and in keeping with their faith and traditions.

That increase happened between 2011 and 2013 with the number of apps increasing from 11,000 to 42,000. Apps mentioned by Risk IQ seem to largely deal with personalizing your phone, entertainment and gaming. But apps popular with business users might also be affected too. The report classed an app as malicious if it contained spyware, or an SMS trojan. Malicious apps do a variety of different things including sending contact lists, email addresses and other important information to third parties without the users consent. Google managed to remove about 60 percent of malicious apps from Google Play in 2011. By 2013, the malicious apps Google had removed had dropped to only 23 percent of those in the store, the report claims. This means Google left the remainder of these apps on the site to be downloaded by unsuspecting users. Not everyone is convinced by the report though. ZDNet , by virtue of the fact that Google routinely scans the Google Play store for malware, . Bouncer also scans new apps which are uploaded to the store for the first time. And the app doesnt make it into the store, unless Bouncer gives it the all-clear. So if malicious apps have increased by almost 400 percent, then is Bouncer a total failure? If these stats are true, then it would be good news for Apple, who has many more safeguards in place to prevent malware apps. A report like this may deter people from using an Android device, and instead persuade them to use an iOS device instead.","Separating work from pleasure is difficult enough, but when it comes to your employees using company smartphones for personal use, it can be costly. Nowadays, this concern goes beyond using the phone for personal calls, of course. It goes beyond using a smartphone, too. An employee could be using any smart device, like a tablet, and consuming most of your monthly data allowances for personal use. Soon however, it may be easier to separate personal voice, data and messaging charges on personal devices from business ones. BlackBerry recently acquired SIM developer Movirtu. The company provides technology that lets users have multiple numbers active on a single device. This means the possibility of separate BlackBerry accounts for business and personal. For small businesses, this could help conserve valuable data allocations and also save on the time that comes with trying to monitor employees personal use of company-owned devices. Conversely, with the rise of the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) movement in which many employees would rather use their own technology, this makes it much easier to separate personal from company use. Movirtu CEO Carsten Brinkschulte says that his companys goal is to create virtual identities on smart devices. This allows the same device to operate under two different accounts. In a post on the Inside BlackBerry Business Blog,Brinkschulte : BlackBerry notes that a recent ruling in California requires companies to reimburse employees for data and call charges that an employee incurs while using their own smart devices for work use. The solution being considered by BlackBerry and Movirtu would make this much easier on a practical level. Brinkschulte says his company already has worked with all the major mobile carriers in the past and those industry connections could result in a rather rapid integration of Movirtus technology into BlackBerry devices in the future. BlackBerry says it plans to introduce Virtual SIM identification technology into devices soon. These devices will be supported by all major mobile carriers, too.","Facebook confirmed rumors Thursday by introducing video sharing to its Instagram service.At a press event, Instagram Co-Founder, Kevin Systrom, unveiled the new Instagram video feature to the already popular Facebook and social media app. The new Instagram video feature comes just two weeks after Twitter-owned rival to Android users. Previously, the popular video app was exclusively available on iOS. The announcement also comes as Vine is making considerable headway with users, in the sheer number of files shared on Twitter. However, the Instagram video feature is not simply a duplication of what is currently available with Vine.For example, instead of 6 seconds, Instagram videos deliver 15 seconds of video. And unlike Vine, videos play a single time through instead of looping. You can capture a lot in 15 seconds, Systrom told onlookers at the press event. We need to do with video what we did with photos. Capturing videos with Instagram will be relatively easy. There is no new app to download; the Instagram video feature is now added into the Instagram app. If a user wants to use video instead of photo sharing, they just need to select the video icon, press and release the record button and start capturing video. Each 15-second video can be started and stopped with a press of the record button and clips from the video can be deleted with just a few button pushes, too. The Instagram team also added 13 new filters exclusively for Instagram video, similar to the filters that are used by the 130 million current users of the photo sharing feature. Also, where Vine videos tend to be jumpy like most other video captured on a smartphone or tablet, a Cinema feature on Instagram videos stabilizes what youre sharing. Instagram video users will be able to customize how they share their videos, specifically the thumbnail that appears on Facebook news feeds. A user can select an image from the video they just captured and make it their thumbnail which their friends will click rather than have the thumbnail be preselected. In the more than two years that Instagram has been available to the public, users have shared 16 billion photos, Systrom said. Those photos get about 1 billion likes per day on Facebook, which acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion.","Its time again for the Small Business Trends news roundup.

But as more consumers go cash-free in favor of credit cards or even electronic options, these traditional tip jars have become nearly obsolete. Now theres a startup thats looking to create an updated version of the traditional tip jar. is a device that allows customers to leave $1 tips with their credit or debit cards. The device looks similar to a regular tip jar and can also sit on store counters so customers can leave tips without further assistance from employees. Theres a slit in the center of the jar where users can insert their cards and pull them back out. That action automatically leaves a $1 tip. Currently, the device only works in the specified increments  normally just $1. And there are a few other issues the company is trying to work out. For instance, some users have expressed confusion about whether or not their tip actually went through when they inserted their cards. The company claims that the device makes a noise when a payment is processed, but it can be difficult to hear over the ambient noise of a coffee shop. They are also reportedly working on a feature that will have DipJar light up when a payment goes through. For now, DipJar is being tested at about 20 locations throughout New York. But the company is working on the next generation of these electronic tip jars and hopes to make them widely available soon. Interested businesses can sign up for updates on the companys website. The company has been running trials for about two years now. The participating businesses seem to be happy with the results, according to DipJar co-founder and CEO Ryder Kessler. He CNN: Theres also a version available for charities and non-profit organizations that collects donations. GiveJar devices (pictured at the top of this article) can collect donations in a few different increments: $1, $2 or $5. Organizations can choose the increment that makes the most sense for their collection location. But there isnt currently a model that allows varied donation amounts within the same device. DipJar takes eight cents of every dollar it collects for processing. This, along with credit card processing fees, means that each dollar a customer tips doesnt actually mean a dollar for the employees. But for customers who dont have cash to put in a regular tip jar, it still can be better than nothing.","For most Internet accounts, it takes much longer to upload a video, photo or other large file than to download content from the Web. This is especially a problem for small businesses as they increasingly need to share more and more content with customers online. But one online provider says, for small businesses and many other users, that is about to change. Verizon says it will increase upload speeds for its small business and residential FIOS customers to match their current download rates. The company announced its Verizon SpeedMatch program today Sept. 22 to even out upload and download speeds on its FIOS network. So, a small business with download speed of 50Mbps should be able to upload video and other files at the same speed from now on. Heres a video outlining the program in more detail: The Verizon SpeedMatch upgrade is available for customers with FIOS speeds up to 500Mbps. Typically, upload speeds have been only half the speed at which most FIOS users can download content from the Web. But that arrangement is no longer meeting the needs of most small business customers. In a news release on the official Verizon website, vice president of National Mass Business Marketing Mary Yarbrough, : Verizon says the increased upload speed will give small businesses many capabilities they dont currently have. Those capabilities include sending large files more quickly. For instance, if a medical office wants to send an MRI result over the Web, that 100MB file would take about 53 seconds to upload on a 15Mbps connection. When the upload speed is increased to 50Mbps, it takes just 16 seconds to upload the image, Verizon says. But higher upload speeds also allow small businesses to participate in more seamless video conferences. And it also allows them to more easily stream events online. Small business owners wishing to learn more about the new Verizon SpeedMatch program rolling out to all Verizon FIOS users this Fall can visit . Verizon believes the demand for high speed upload will only increase in the next few years. For example, in a news release detailing the new program, the Internet carrier estimates that by 2016 the upload activity on its FIOS network will have doubled. The company also expects the number of devices connected to the Internet to increase in the next few years. And this too will likely increase the demand for higher upload and download speeds, the company says.","With all the noise from email, texts, voicemail, in-person meetings, and other distractions, it is far from easy to get work done with technology. Web-based applications promise to make it easier and more affordable for small business owners to get things done. Smartsheet may have cracked the code on how to get more done with its online project collaboration service. You may be asking the same question I had: What does online project collaboration mean, really? Is it as simple as sharing a file or is there more to it and why would I, as a small business owner, want to do it? Read on. I usually start with an overview of the product as the above home page screenshot would imply, but this time, Id like to suggest you click on the third tab testimonials to . Frankly, I often view testimonials with suspicion, but these case studies answered why and how others are using the service. This section quickly answered my questions about how I would be able to use Smartsheet. I didnt find sales-speak. Customers talk about how they use Smartsheet to manage their projects and even their company operations. The examples were so well done that it motivated me to click through to the free trial. I particularly liked the one on the Virtual Assistant (VA) Networking Association with its 10,000 assistants. Many SaaS (software-as-a-service) applications aim to make the user experience drop-dead simple and elegant. Smartsheet does that, but they took it one step further in my book, and included these little tips boxes (which you can turn off) and pointers to help you figure out what to do. Right after you sign up, you are sent to a sample page with little help boxes all over the screen. At first glance, this screenshot is busy, but after taking just a second to get your bearings, youll quickly find that most of it is static and the next steps happen in the Welcome to Smartsheet box to the right. From that one introductory screen, you are able to navigate and get started. I clicked on See Example Templates because I wanted to see the range of things I could do. There are 119 templates in the gallery and from there you can kickstart nearly any type of project or process. As a quick aside, I appreciate when a company does what it says its going to do. On the sign-up page, Smartsheet promises a 60 Second Sign-up that honestly only took 15 seconds and I was up and running. Along with that, there is no credit card required to do the free trial. Most companies try to capture your card info. Something else I really liked: Smartsheet enables you as the owner/manager of the sheet to involve contributors without ever requiring them to login to the application. During my test, my clients and friends didnt have to sign up, although some of them might once they see it. With Smartsheet, I can assign a task to someone on my team and request that they update the status of that item in Smartsheet. In part of my test, I requested a team member change the task name. That person received an email from me and then when they complete that item, I receive an email showing it completed and what was entered (which is highlighted in yellow). I can select to receive all these updates or not. I can attach files to a specific row in the sheet which gives me a one-stop place to manage my project from the web and for my team to get access to it as well. If you want someone to get that document, you dont send them the actual file and wait while they make changes. You send them a download link to Smartsheet location where the most up-to-date version resides. As you change and update the document, you store the most recent version, as well as previous versions, in this one location. No application is perfect and Smartsheet lacks a few things. There is no search function, but I have heard that this is coming very soon. It would also be ideal to see a way to collect web content via a webform into the app, from a survey, for example. The last challenge I see is function/feature overload for the user. This is a good thing and bad thing. The application is rich with features, but it can be intimidating to use because you dont know what to do first. The pre-built templates solve some of this, thankfully. What you are trying to do with a service like Smartsheet is save time passing information among your employees and teams and keep it in one place instead. Conceptually, this should make business easier. As the manager, I can now set alerts that notify me when someone makes a change or adds new information or gets the job done. This could be more info and emails to manage, but they make it user-friendly and I can set how often and what I want to see in an alert. While many compare Smartsheet to a spreadsheet, it is much more than that. It is a centralized online location to create and manage projects and processes.

No doubt you can find a small and lightweight one, but some of the least expensive laptops are huge. I went searching for lighter and slimmer solutions for the mobile small business owner. The Samsung Chromebook offers an interesting option and is the focus of this review. Samsung provided a 30-day loaner unit for this review. If youre not familiar with the new Chromebooks, you may find this review interesting and these machines a good alternative to more powerful, and expensive, computers. The Chromebook is a laptop that runs only the Chrome browser from Google. Thats it. No operating system of any type that you may have seen before. It starts up in 8 seconds-yes, only 8 seconds. The closest device Ive seen to rival its weight, speed and design is the MacBook Air. However, before the Mac community flips out, let me say the Chromebook is clearly not a MacBook Air. But if you live your life in Web applications for the most part, then this device may save you money and save your back from toting larger laptops. Many small businesses dont need more than a browser-based solution. The Samsung Chromebook is a solid contender for your technology purchase budget. With the many, many apps on Googles marketplace, you can run your business from the Web. With prices starting around $429 (at publication time), you get a device that rivals the more powerful netbooks on the market (less power, less cost), minus the full-scale OS and traditional apps. Like everything in business today, in my humble opinion, you have to take a closer look at why and how you operate your company. Do you need to spend $1,000-plus on a simple laptop? Do you need a more powerful desktop? Its fine if you do, but the options exist to reduce costs with machines like these.

Well, funny thing, because an interesting real-life example just presented itselfand it probably affects you and your business. Last week Google announced that it had . This update did many things, but the most the drastic thing achieved by the new was that it .  Yup, all of them.  Gone. Google announced that Yelp review content had been reclassified and will no longer reside as review snippets. A Google spokesperson : The removal of Yelp reviews from Google Places is a notable change and comes as both parties were becoming increasingly frustrated with how content was being handled. But thats for them to figure out.  You want to know how Yelp and Google chasing each other around the playground affects you and your small business. And the answer to that depends  were you a small business owner who sought out reviews from a variety of different sources, or did you make Yelp your steady, assuming theyd always be there? If you did the latter, you have some make-up work to do. Regardless, here are some tips for small business owners looking to manage reviews in a Yelp vs. Google world. :  While Google and Yelp may have taken issue with how reviews were being aggregated, most small business owners did not. It meant that they only had to direct customers to Yelp to populate both sites with reviews. However, now you have to specifically encourage customers to leave reviews on your Google Place Page, and its important that you do so.  Your Google Place Page is often the first point of contact a user has with your brand given how much weight Google Place Pages have in the SERPs and within Google Maps.  That means you want to populate this page with lots of positive reviews and information about your business to build trust with users. Google recently opened up the option to let business owners .  You want to make sure youre taking advantage of that and showing your best face to visitors. : Google has stopped aggregating reviews from Yelp, but they are collecting reviews from other sources. Its your job to find out where.  Take a place at several Place pages for your city + industry and note where Google is pulling reviews from. Which appear to be their favorite sites? Once you know, are you well represented there? If not, you may want to work these sites into your review efforts so that youll be replacing the reviews that you lost from Yelp.  Just because Google and Yelp are taking a relationship break doesnt mean you want to take a break from your customers. : When youre , dont be shy about directing users to certain sites or asking them to repost reviews on sites that are important to you (and tell them which ones those are!).  If a customer left you a glowing review on Yelp, it may be worth an e-mail asking if theyd mind reposting on Google Places.   If they were so happy with their experience that theyre leaving one review, its likely they wouldnt mind reposting it somewhere else, as well.  Educate them on your preferred review process. :  Just because Yelp reviews will no longer appear in Google Place Page listing doesnt mean you should ignore the site.  Yelp remains important to your business because its still important to your customers. Your customers dont care that Google and Yelp are in a tiff. They use Yelp to leave reviews, get information about your business, and to discover other places they may be interested in.  Ignoring Yelp and new features like is essentially cutting off one arm of your marketing efforts.  Dont buy into the knee-jerk reaction to ignore Yelp altogether. You tell me: How are you dealing with Yelp reviews being removed from your Google Place Page?  Are you angry about it? Relieved?","You might take hundreds of photos with your smartphone but do you ever print them? In truth many of the photos taken with a smartphone are never looked at again. The team behind wanted to make a phone case that could instantly print photos from your phone, anywhere. They are calling it memories you can hold in your hand and give away. Prynt is kind of like turning your smartphone into a Polaroid camera. The company boasts that by clicking your smartphone into the Prynt case you can take a photo and print it in less than a minute. Prynt doesnt use Bluetooth or WiFi. By snapping a smartphone right into the case you are suppose to get a direct and speedy connection. First, its modular. By changing out the dock, one Prynt can be used on multiple phones. With modular cell phones hitting the market in some countries, this could give Prynt an edge. Its also great knowing that your Prynt wont become useless just because you upgraded your phone. Second, theres the Prynt app. Specifically the Prynt apps augmented reality capability. Prynt claims that their app can take short videos while you take photos and stores them online. By holding your phone over a printed photo the app will scan and recognize it then play the video right over the picture. Its like watching the photo come to life. See the example below: Prynt looks bulky for a phone case. There is appeal in turning your phone into a Polaroid-like camera, but the added width may not be something you want to carry around. So, Prynt may be more of an accessory for special occasions. Also, as of right now, Prynt is only compatible with iPhone 5, iPhone 6, Galaxy S4, and Galaxy S5. Still, the device has gotten a lot of attention from its Kickstarter campaign, over $600,000. See the video from the campaign below: With this kind of backing, the developers ambitious stretch goal of $1 million could be possible. But what could be worth this high of a mark? How about an extra color option? The added fundraising goal may seem a bit excessive for one extra color. But Prynt is looking to include their customers in the color decision.

But less than two percent of accredited business school faculty members teach entrepreneurship and small business, and less than one percent of college freshmen intend to major in it, data from two major surveys reveals. While a higher fraction of college students is likely have some exposure to entrepreneurship classes, my best guess would be that even that share is in the single digits. But let me stick to the hard numbers. According to the , which surveys incoming college freshmen annually, only 0.7 percent of the 193,000 students at 283 U.S. colleges and universities who responded to the 2012 survey, said that they intend to major in entrepreneurship. To give you a sense of how large this fraction is, consider these numbers: 2.3 percent of incoming college students plan to study accounting; 2.6 percent intend to major in elementary education; 6.9 percent aim to major in biology; 2.7 percent plan to study mechanical engineering; and 1.0 percent intend to major in economics. Of course, the fraction of students planning to study entrepreneurship isnt the same everywhere; the intended major is more common at some types of academic institutions than others. The major is most popular at historically Black colleges and universities, where 1.6 percent of incoming freshmen planned to major in it in 2012. In fact, at private Black colleges the fraction reached 2 percent of entering students, the HERI survey revealed. The numbers were considerably lower at other types of academic institutions. The HERI survey revealed that 0.8 percent of freshmen at nonsectarian colleges, and 0.6 at Catholic institutions planned to major in the subject. But only 0.5 percent of students at non-Catholic religious institutions planned to study the topic. At universities, the numbers were higher than at four-year colleges. The HERI survey shows that 1.2 percent of students at private universities, but only 0.7 percent of students at public universities, intended to major in the subject. The vast majority of intended entrepreneurship majors are male. The HERI survey shows that 1.1 percent of male students plan to major in entrepreneurship versus only 0.3 percent of female ones. At most colleges and universities, entrepreneurship classes and majors are taught by business school faculty, but only a minority of accredited business schools worldwide offer degrees in the subject. A  the largest association of business faculty and administrators  21 percent of AACSB-accredited institutions worldwide offer at least one undergraduate program in entrepreneurship or small business and 10 percent provide at least one program at the MBA level. Only 6 percent of schools offer a specialty masters degree in the subject. Only a tiny slice of full-time business school faculty members falls in the entrepreneurship discipline  2 percent of the total full-time faculty pool at AACSB-accredited institutions. That number is growing slowly, with the AACSB reporting its accredited institutions planned to increase the number of full-time doctoral positions in the discipline by 4 percent in the most recent year its member institutions were surveyed. For all the media attention entrepreneurship education on college campuses receives, it remains a niche course of study.","The story of Manish Bhattacharya stands out not only because of his humble beginnings but his determination and grit. Manish is a final year student of computer science engineering at Shobhit University Meerut. He has a knack for discovering vulnerabilities in web applications and so far has discovered bugs in the websites of Microsoft, Facebook, Dropbox, Shopify, Asana, Github etc and has won awards. Manish studied in Bhagalpur, Bihar and was introduced to computers when he was in 3rd standard. However, the genius in him was dormant until he joined engineering. When Manish got into college, he got his hand on computer magazines and was hooked. He began to read more and more about hacking and started trying out what he learnt on various websites. In 2012 when Manish was in his second year, one of his friends blogged about an XSS vulnerability in MSN. Motivated by him Manish also tried his hand on the website of Microsoft Canada and posted the vulnerability. Microsoft acknowledged his gesture giving him a mention on their page. That was only the beginning. Manish received his first award from Asana for a discovering a Click Jacking vulnerability, he was awarded $ 100 for it. Also during the same time one of his friend discovered a vulnerability in Facebook and was awarded $5000. Motivated by him, Manish also started digging deeper and found two vulnerabilities related to messages and notes which allowed users to send messages to any Facebook profile using the compose page of the new mobile site. The second issue which related to the mobile site was about getting likes and comments on any notes using ClickJacking. After interacting with users who have shared the Facebook note, Manish could get likes and comments from their profile without them knowing about it. After that instance, Manish received 3 more bounties from Facbook. In another instance Manish discovered several vulnerabilities in GitHub. Some were critical enough that he could take over any account on GitHub by modifying certain parameters. Github created a page for Manish (the first one for an Indian at the time). Manish also discovered an XSS vulnerability with Shopify and reported the vulnerability to the team. But they were reluctant and dismissed it. It was only when Manish logged into their forum and stared posting to reveal the true nature of the vulnerability, that it was acknowledged. And once more Manish was inducted into their hall of fame. He has also contributed to the security of Dropbox by discovering vulnerabilities. Till date, Manish has found close to 50 bugs and his path has been rewarding. Manish talks about his most difficult time during the early days. During his engineering admission their father didn't have enough money to pay the fee. He borrowed 25,000 from the owner of the medical shop where he worked and gave an application for loan in the bank. However, a bank official asked him for the bribe to process the loan application. But Manish said, If he had the money he wouldn't have applied for the loan. Manish complained to higher authorities. His application was processed. But the bank officials were furious at him. They forced him to take his complaint back but Manish didn't back out. Today Manish says he has paid all the loans with the bounty he received from bugs. Manish is looking forward to starting up on his own after graduation, though he has a couple of offers from startups and multinationals and work in the field of computer security.","    Reliance Jio 's extravagant trial offer that allows customers to use unlimited data for free for three months is facing backlash from the top telecom operators of the country.  India's top telecom operators Airtel , Vodafone, Idea wrote to the Department of Telecom to stop Reliance Jio's test trial immediately. Telecom industry body COAI in its letter to Telecom Secretary, JS Deepak said that Jio has already rolled out their complete services under the guise of testing. ""This is no test. This is the provisioning of full-blown and full-fledged services masquerading as tests, which bypass regulations and can potentially game policy features like the IUC (interconnection usage charge) regime, non predatory pricing, fair competition etc"". In an indirect response to the incumbent telecom players, Mukesh Ambani led Reliance Jio promptly wrote to the telecom regulator saying ""steps taken by COAI in last few days by issuing press releases, alleging unfounded biases with the regulator and by writing letters against test trials are in fact attempts to sabotage the market entry of RJIL"" Calling the allegations ""malicious, unfounded, ill informed and frivolous"", Reliance Jio's letter says that the COAI's campaign appears to be an exercise to promote the vested interests of the incumbent dominant players.  Jio initially began testing its voice and data services with employees only scheme and now the company has over 1.5 million customers after they extended their free data trail offer to retail consumers. And this figure has not gone down well with the existing telcos ""In order to ensure compliance to licence conditions and the Trai regulations and guidelines, we request your (DoT) urgent intervention in this matter and instruct the said licensee to stop such practices. Further, they should be instructed to immediately disconnect all such connections provided to general public under the guise of test connections,"" COAI said.  Reliance Jio's launch has been long awaited and Jio puts the onus of delay in the commercial launch of its services on the incumbent players saying they are not offering the requisite interconnection bandwidth and that incumbents are using their dominant position to stifle other operators.  The key challenge however for the operators new and old is to maintain and grow their subscriber base and incumbent players accuse Jio of porting subscribers with the ""so called trial offer"". In the letter to DoT, COAI said, ""(Jio) has also tried to port subscribers from other operators, even though this is a prelaunch test period"".  While the war of words is in full swing between the telecom players now it's time for the telecom department and telecom regulator of the country to give their verdict.  Image Source: AndroidCentral ","Twitter sent out thousands of reset notices this week and media sources report users may have had trouble accessing their accounts initially. The problem was not hacking, however, the company insists. Instead, it was simply a system error that caused Twitter to send the notices to thousands of users by accident. At the time, Twitter also said it had reset affected passwords for user protection. In a portion of the initial email reprinted by Naked Security, the : Then, in a complete reversal, a Twitter spokesperson : Twitter users, including many small business owners, can at least breathe a sigh of relief. It would seem that their personal and business data has not been compromised this time. It isnt the first time that potentially putting user data at risk. And, of course, Twitter users, including those with legitimate business accounts, have also endured other problems. Take the rash of back in 2013. If you use Twitter regularly for your business, these problems are just par for the course. But if you run an online business, youll also want to think about how such system hiccups make you feel. Try to keep similar problems to a minimum for your users and customers and be sure to make up for mistakes when they happen.","Most small-business owners need a bank loan at one time or another, and applying for one involves much more than filling out paperwork and saying a prayer. Among other things, you need to consider the state of your personal and business finances, how you're going to repay the loan, and how much money you actually need. Here are some of the key questions you should ask before starting an application: Is it likely I will qualify for the loan? You're only going to hurt your credit if you apply for a loan you won't get. ""Just like if you get declined for a personal credit card, it makes it more difficult to borrow in the future,"" says David Gass , a business consultant and coach in Meridian, Idaho. ""If you get turned down, it looks to the next bank like you're a bad risk."" He suggests asking lending institutions about their specific requirements before applying. Many will let you know the minimum credit score they require, the cash flow you need to show, and other qualifying factors. How much do I really need? Before you approach the bank, make sure you have a good handle on how much cash you actually need. The best way to determine this is to create a monthly cash-flow projection. Does your customer pay you in 60 days, but you have to pay your vendors in 15 days? If so, you might need extra money to tide you over. ""It will reflect poorly on you if you come in to the bank asking for $50,000, then they ask you to create a cash-flow projection and you find out that you actually need $100,000,"" says Adam Hoeksema, co-founder of Muncie, Ind.-based ProjectionHub , a Web app to help entrepreneurs make financial projections. ""You should know how much you need and how you will use the funds before approaching the bank."" How much can I borrow based on the asset I'm using for collateral? Business owners often think if they purchase a piece of equipment for $100,000, they should be able to borrow $100,000 by pledging the equipment as collateral. But banks usually don't agree, Hoeksema says. ""Banks will value your asset below what you think the value should be, and then they will only lend up to a certain percentage of the value of the asset."" For example, banks might lend up to 70 percent of the value of a new piece of equipment, and maybe only 60 percent for a used piece of equipment. Do I have adequate cash flow to repay the loan? Your banker will probably ask you to provide financial projections for the business. Make sure to include your debt repayment plan in those projections. Bankers are going to be looking for businesses that have some wiggle room, and you may need to show available cash flow that is three times greater than your debt payment requirements, Hoeksema says. ""They don't want to see if you lose one customer, you won't be able to make your loan payment this month. If your projections show that you have very little room for error, you are likely to scare them away."" Will the money help my business grow? If you're borrowing $10,000 for payroll or other routine operating expenses, you're not generating more revenue from the loan and could find yourself in the same spot three to six months from now. Instead, you should put borrowed dollars into the parts of the business that will generate more revenue over time and help reduce future borrowing needs, Gass says. ""If I take that dollar and leverage it, put it into sales and marketing and drive more revenues -- $1 driving $5 -- then it's worth it. It's all about growing the business."" How good is my business credit score? Most people know their personal credit score, but very few know their business score, says Rohit Arora, CEO and co-founder of Biz2credit , a New York-based company that arranges loans for small businesses. As with personal credit, you can find your business credit score through Experian, Transunion or Equifax. If the score isn't as high as you think it should be, it might be because there are outstanding liens against your business. Also, check to make sure your vendors are reporting your payments. You can try to boost your score by reducing the balance on your business credit cards or requesting a credit-line increase to lower the percentage of your available credit in use. ""The lender is going to check your business, and your score is the final arbiter of whether you get the loan or not,"" Arora says. ""Even if you have stellar personal credit and good assets, if a lot of business contacts are saying you're paying them late, that's going to scare off lenders."" Are my personal finances in order? Bankers may want to look at your ""global financial statement,"" including personal information like outstanding student loans, personal credit card debt and mortgage payments. Until your business reaches a substantial size ($5 million to $10 million in annual revenue or more), the bank is going to rely heavily on your personal financial statement and personal credit score to determine the creditworthiness of your business. ""If you have a $200,000 mortgage on a house worth $250,000, and you have $200,000 in student loans, the bank may not see you as a good candidate for a loan,"" Hoeksema says. ""If you have a lot of personal debt and very little collateral that you can provide to the bank, you may need to find a strong co-signer."" Do I have all the documentation I need to apply for the loan? Arora says some studies have shown that as many as four in five loans never close -- ""not because the business didn't qualify, but because of the paper chase."" When applying for a business loan, you will need a lot of documentation. For example if you're seeking a Small Business Administration loan, Arora recommends you provide the last three years of business and personal tax returns, personal financial statements and financial projections for the next 12 to 24 months. ""If you go to the [lender] and are not fully prepared, not only does it make you look unprofessional, but by the time you get the documentation in place, it might be outdated,"" he says. Does the loan have a prepayment penalty? When you take out a loan, find out if you're free to pay it off early without any penalty. Some states allow lenders to charge prepayment penalties, in which case you should try to negotiate a compromise. For example, you could agree to a penalty only if you pay off the loan in a relatively short period of time, say, within six months from the time of the loan. ""Prepayment is especially valuable if you believe your business may grow soon, and you may need a larger line of credit,"" says Jeanne Brutman , a New York-based financial planner for small-business owners. ""By having good excess cash and a paid-off or [paid-down] line of credit, it shows the lender you are responsible with debt and can handle an increase in your total credit."" If I die, how will the loan be repaid? It's something most people don't like to think about, but in the event of your death, an unpaid business loan can affect your family. ""Most people think, if I die, the bank is out of luck, but that's not true,"" Brutman says. If you leave a large life insurance policy, for example, the bank may come after that. Find out what a lender's policy is in the event of your death to best determine how to protect your family. ""Most business owners understand that if they're collateralizing their house and the business fails, they could lose their house,"" Brutman says. ""But they may not understand that if they die, it doesn't cancel out their debts."" It may be best to put your assets in your spouse's name, if the spouse doesn't have an ownership stake in the business. Brutman also recommends personal property and casualty insurance coverage, which in the event of your death, takes business debt into consideration.","As important as tracking employee time is for organizations, it is typically tough to get employees jazzed about it. From their point of view, its at best a minor administrative nuisance. At worst, its a waste of time entirely. Companies have tried various ideas to make time tracking more fun and less of a chore for their employees. went the humorous route and used their own employees to create motivational posters and pinned them around the office. Regardless of the approach, the issue needs to be addressedso whats a leader to do? If you tell someone to do something that like busywork and like busywork without telling them why its vital to the operations of the company, theyre going to blow it off. Its like getting the creative and operational teams to work together. If neither team understands the jargon of the other, what the other does or why its important, they wont take the time to make it work. Its your job to make sure communication barriers are removed and the importance is clear. This could include: Obviously, if the company isnt successful, the employees wont be successful either. So you need to articulate how this data is going to be used in the short and long run. According to the , For goals to be meaningful and effective in motivating employees, they must be tied to larger organizational ambitions. Employees who dont understand the roles they play in company success are more likely to become disengaged. Additionally, according to , 84% of people surveyed said they dont get enough information from top management, while 75% said their employers arent telling them enough about changes in policies and goals. Almost the same number (74%) said consistent messages from senior management, although few and far between, are important to them. Be clear about why its important, and communicate often. Even after they understand the need to track their time, you might still find some employees slacking on the effort. But heres the reality of it: time tracking can be useful for seeing which projects are the best use of employees time, which teams perform well and on what types of projects. According to by Raj Sisodia, purpose-driven companies . Now that your employees are working toward a common purpose, youll need to monitor progress, but from a distance. As a manager, youll quickly be able to identify those who are just entering in their time haphazardly versus those trying to do it correctly. Not to mention, you can give your employees a bit of power by having them hold each other accountable with different approval levels. This is important to note, because according to , Your employees are much more likely to own their work when they help create or have a voice in what theyre doing. In the end, time tracking (and other types of data collection) are meant to help make your workplace environment run more efficiently. They also meant to allow the company to be more profitable as a whole (which, of course, is going to make things better for the employees!) Because of that, its worth the time to make sure your employees understand why its necessary and how it works to their benefit.","If you want to connect with small business professionals like yourself, then one way to do it is by visiting .

Which LinkedIn business groups do you belong to?","Small Business Majority The New York Times Many employers already pay their employees more than the minimum wage. A whopping 82 percent of small business owners in the survey pay more than the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Small business owners think increasing the minimum wage will benefit their sales. Fifty-two percent of entrepreneurs in the survey say raising the minimum wage will help small businesses because minimum-wage earners, who are more likely than other consumers to shop at local businesses, will have more money available to spend on products and services. Small business owners also believe that raising the minimum wage will help them compete. Thirty-five percent expect that a higher minimum wage will prevent competitors from undercutting them on labor costs. They want to relieve the burden on taxpayers. More than half (54 percent) of survey respondents think it would be helpful if minimum-wage earners had more of their own money to spend and could rely less on government assistance, thus on taxpayers, to survive. They believe its the right thing to do. Finally, the same percentage (54 percent) of respondents think its not right that the current minimum wage only provides a salary of $15,080 annually for a full-time worker. When adjusted for inflation, the study notes that this is significantly lower than the salary of a full-time minimum wage worker in the 1960s. Depending on what state youre in, of course, whether the federal increase passes or not may not matter. The Times reports that 34 state legislatures are currently mulling increasing their state minimum wages, some of them to levels even higher than $10.10 per hour, and that eight more states may add ballot initiatives this fall that would increase the state minimum wage. Do you support raising the minimum wage?","Are you worried about the rising cost of health insurance for yourself and your employees? Youre probably not alone, and concerns about cost may be one reason why nearly all (87 percent) of business executives nationwide believe workplace wellness programs are beneficial for their companies. The study , conducted by the Alliance for a Healthier Minnesota, polled business leaders nationwide and in six states to find out what they thought of workplace wellness programs and what challenges they faced in implementing them. Three-fourths of respondents said community-based networks of business leaders would be useful resources to learn about workplace wellness initiatives and share information and ideas.Said Tom Mason, president of the organization, in announcing the results: Some 84 percent say such programs led to lower healthcare costs. Ninety-six percent say they help employees enjoy healthier lifestyles, 84 percent say they boost productivity, 78 percent say they lower absenteeism rates and 58 percent say they reduce workers compensation claims. More than half (55 percent) of employers in the survey already have workplace wellness programs in place. While improving employee health is the top goal (cited by 92 percent), reducing healthcare costs was the second most important goal (cited by 85 percent). The major health issues employers say their employees are struggling with are obesity (5 percent), stress (51 percent) and lack of exercise (51 percent). Speaking of goals, even employers who had programs in place were struggling to measure ROI from the programs, with just 42 percent actually doing so. Among those who hadnt implemented worksite wellness programs, cost (65 percent), concerns about getting enough participants (59 percent), and lack of time (54 percent) were the main reasons for not doing so. I bet the reasons for not doing so cited above ring pretty true. Here are steps you can take to get past these obstacles and get a wellness initiative going: As the business owner, you need to commit to the importance of wellness in the workplace. Model the behavior you want to see by taking breaks, working out and eating healthy foods and snacks. A do as I say, not as I do approach wont work for wellness. Put someone at your company in charge of leading the wellness plan implementation. Give them a budget and time frame to work with, and have them find out what employees are interested in, what your insurance offers and whats realistic. The best wellness programs are customized to fit your company culture and employees needs. If your company is staffed by 20-something beach Frisbee players, gym memberships or standing desks might be in order. If most of your team are 40-something moms, stress and weight loss might be their big issues. Many health insurance plans now offer a wellness program or reduced rates on wellness options such as massage, yoga classes, gym memberships and more. Contact your insurance provider to see whats available to you. Even having someone come out to talk to your team about ways to improve wellness is a good way to encourage it","Few books are providing a rallying cry for the environmental and social shifts impacting goods and services. is one of those books. Its cry is worth a listen. I listened to its author, Lisa Gansky ( on Twitter), at the first BizTech Day conference in New York, as I skimmed the free copy given to everyone in the audience.  A founder of multiple Internet companies and a cofounder of Dos Margaritas, a conservation-focused social venture, Gansky is well regarded by business luminaries such as Seth Godin.  After reading , I can see why. I spend a lot of time reading articles online and listening to presenters talk about new ways of doing business today. I still felt that after reading I read a book that offered original thought-provoking utility. Gansky reveals how the standard business model has become aligned with the sharing aspects of community and the managed consumption of sustainability, letting entrepreneurs scale with lower costs. She focuses on startups  some familiar and some unknowns, yet all transformed through the use of advanced Web networks, mobile technologies, and sharable goods.   Readers will learn about businesses such as lending exchange Zopa, peer-to-peer lender Prosper and custom winemaker Crushpad. Social media plays a significant role in .  But social media is mentioned not as a newfangled trend, but as an integral network that is the backbone of delivering value. Gansky reveals the benefits and shares her findings through anecdotes and case studies, all offered in fresh ways. At the heart of the authors thoughts, however, lies the anxiety that has many consumers rethinking their lives, and that have subsequently created more information and social savvy businesses. I loved the analytics perspective that offers in its explanations. Its not overt, but certainly implied.  Gansky nails a great description of Zipcar as being an information company and shows how it manages to use data constructively to serve customers better and develop a competitive advantage. The later chapters are useful for entrepreneurs who want to develop a Mesh business but are not sure where to start or look.  There are five aspects of Mesh: Simple ah-ha suggestions abound. As an example, Gansky suggests that Hotels can easily integrate car and bike sharing into their suite of services.  I also liked Ganskys suggestions for how old, familiar firms can access Mesh aspects, such as the idea for a new kind of tire service for Goodyear. Product design itself is reimagined, as a Mesh-worthy design is: Gansky explains how this new design approach is the result of Mesh aspects merging: Gansky then relates the significance to environmental concerns: Included in the book is a directory that gives wonderful Mesh-related resources on subjects such as home improvement, books and real estate.  This will give you an industry-based starting point for incorporating Mesh characteristics into your business or life. With , Gansky collects excellent examples and truly enlightens with her knowledge, rebooting your sensibilities like a splash of water from a morning shower. offers small businesses a means to develop a profitable model based on sharable goods, as well as ideas for augmenting current offerings at a reasonable costs.  I am delighted that Gansky developed a book that truly combines business acumen, ecological concerns and Internet sensibilities into a startling, unique, must-read package.","Staff training is an on going part of business. You cant just toss people in and expect them to swim. That works for a hand full of all-stars, but if you want to increase the success rate and the consistency in how the team does what it does, then effective training is important. Theres a big difference between having a training session so that you can say you had it; and having a training session that effectively changes behavior. In other words, it doesnt matter what you tell the team if the message doesnt stick. I recently heard my Aunt, whos working on her Masters in Information Technology, say: When it comes to advance education isnt that what we all want? Information that makes a difference in our business, in our daily life? So why torture staff with boring or ineffective training  when theres another option on the table? Dr. John Medina, molecular biologist and author of Brain Rules, says: He continues by stating that we retain and remember six times more information when we the words and the images. In fact, theres a real benefit to adding some entertainment value and true hands on experience to your staff training. But how? Below are five steps to help make any training message stick (Ive used it for well over a decade and teach others to do the same  because it still works). Of course, its more effort on the trainer and the managers end, but it pays off in a team of people that can actually do the work the way you want it done. Successful teams dont build themselves. Effective leaders and managers build successful teams by reinforcing a core message until it becomes second nature for them and their team members. Even though most people retain more by doing than hearing, all training begins with a message about: Before you can expect your team to effectively do anything, explain some things. The goal is to expose them to the information. And since your trainer understands that this is step one, he doesnt have to cram information into people who stopped listening 30 minutes ago. Once youve spoken on the subject, its time to reinforce the information. Create visual reminders to use inside your training and to post around the building. The goal is to provide a bite sized way to digest the information from training, and since a picture is worth a 1000 words, then make it visual. Dont try to cram everything onto one poster. Instead, choose the most important points. You can also: And for online businesses with teams who work from home, you can place your visuals on your private company website, as well as forward it by email. Now your team has an easy reminder of what is expected, instead of having to wade through a dense report or letter. You dont know what you dont know until youre in the middle of the situation. And while hands on is priceless there are certain things that you can NOT allow your team to learn the hard way  because it could be bad for business. So role play. This is the step right before your team gets their hands dirty. Give them a relevant scenario and have them to talk it out and then act it out using the information you just gave. Let them work the kinks out in this setting. Now that your team has heard it, seen it and had to role play it  its time to place them in a real world situation where they have to use what you taught them. To solidify the lesson you have to back off a little bit and let them deal, but make sure they can get in touch with you. Even if you are in the building, let them work it out. They need to feel the fear and find the answer in order to drive the lesson home. Of course you have a business to protect and clients to take care of, but this step is necessary if you intend to have a team that can produce while youre in the hospital, on vacation or at a conference. And for your own peace of mind you can be right around the corner ready to step in, but only if necessary. I dont care what they say, people need a refresher. So after they have gotten their hands dirty, its time talk about the training again. But this time let the staff reteach the lesson to each other. Now youre driving it home. Follow these steps and it will stick because you have to know more in order to teach it to others. Plus the team is pulling from personal experience after these steps and not just theory.",he Nifty ended at 52-week closing high led by banks after a meeting of G20 finance ministers came to a consensus to support global growth amid growing uncertainty post the Britain's exit from the European Union.

Well, during last weeks Le Web conference, business owners received their holiday gift just a little bit early when the new business-focused app was unveiled to the public. is designed to help small- and medium-sized businesses take advantage of their internal knowledgebase by giving them the tools they need to collect, discover, collaborate, search for, and share ideas within their organization for a more productive environment. The new Business version of Evernote makes use of the features free and premium users already loved, while adding a suite of business-only tools and capabilities : As both a former business owner and someone who manages multiple teams, Im most drawn to the Business Library, which becomes a central repository for company information. Anyone in your organization is able to create Notebooks and add to them so that theyre searchable to anyone in your organization. Over time, the amount of information that would rest here could become a huge hub for your business. Whether its a human resource-type knowledge bank, a client-specific notebook documenting all work from all teams, or notebooks about company goals or milestones, aggregating the information into one collaborative environment and making it searchable will benefit many organizations. Think of how many documents get lost in your organization. Or how useful it would be to find out a coworker solved the issue youre facing weeks ago. The best part is Evernote gives you this information without you even needing to know the information exists. You start working on your Notebook and Evernote will find information it feels is relevant to what youre doing. It does the work for you. Another feature I like is the ability for users to maintain and leverage personal notebooks, without making them sharable to the whole organization. Performing a search in Evernote will give users access to everything theyve created + everything the business has created. This is a great way to increase efficiency, while not sacrificing privacy to do it. Of course, there are also potential problems with Evernote Business In order for your organization to really benefit for Evernote Business there needs to be a clear understanding of how Notepads and information are to be tagged and what the process is for creating them. Without that, its easy to see how a team of users entering in their own information in their own way could quickly become a bit of a mess and something that is hard to navigate and understand. However, if youre able to get everyone on the same page and using Evernote for Business the same way, it could replace many of the Google Apps that business owners rely on. What do you think of the new Evernote app? At $10 a month per user, is there a place for it in your business?","The robust growth showed off during its first quarter earnings call this morning was nothing short of astounding. The Isreali-based tech firm $28.8 million in revenue for the quarter, an 86 percent increase year over year. And thats nothing compared to its 46 million and growing user base. The company says it has seen a 45 percent increase since this time last year. And 908,000 of those are paying customers. All of this comes from a company that only went public last fall with a total of 38 million users already on its platform. The company also runs a curated full of tools for managing Web presence.

In his comments during the sales call, Abrahami : At first glance, mobile appears to be another place Wix is experiencing run away growth.","Clate Mask, CEO of Infusionsoft, a company that specializes insales and marketing automation,joins Brent Leary to discuss the recent investment of $54 million dollars the company received from Goldman Sachs and also their acquisition of GroSocial, a suite of web-based tools that allow you to build and track social media campaigns  and the benefits these recent events will bring to you and your small business. * * * * * I did have other choices. We had some other great people. But I think if I had to summarize why Goldman Sachs, I would put it this way; number one they had a real desire and an appetite to invest in small business and that was a surprise to me. But it was also extremely refreshing and exciting. Goldman Sachs really is interested in us over a long stretch. That was super important to us. So I would best summarize it as small business passion, long term focus, and then good validation. I think you are right, Brent. For us and Infusionsoft, it is marketing automation, it is CRM, it is eCommerce, it is sales and marketing automation. There is no doubt about the fact that a big part of what we do is marketing automation. A big part of what Goldman Sachs sees is marketing automation. The combination of CRM and marketing automation is a special thing for smaller businesses. I agree that the very low end of the market with true small businesses that we serve; we just see more and more of the appetite to have sales and marketing go together. I feel that at the enterprise level it makes more sense, or its more feasible, for a standalone marketing automation solution that plugs into, or is integrated with, other CRM and other systems. We see in these companies that are less sophisticated, that integration is just one more challenging thing that they have to try to figure out. We feel like the momentum we continued to build last year is just more and more validation of small businesses saying: First, we recognize that to do all-in-one sales in marketing, software for small business lead generation needs to be a more prominent part of the solution. Early on, we were much more a lead conversion company. But over the last couple of years, we have really embraced the idea that it is not just about conversion. Its also about lead generation. Second, its clear that social media is an absolutely necessary part of the sales in marketing suite for small businesses. What we have seen over the last 18 months or so is an evolution from social media being an interesting part of small business lead generation and customer relations activities  to becoming a necessary part of it. To be totally honest, our take on it two years ago was that social media was useful for companies in monitoring brand. It was interesting for big businesses, and it was promising in a lot of ways. But we did not see a lot of hardcore practical value for small businesses, and how they were extracting value. A year ago that began to change quite a bit and we started to see some pretty strong data that showed small businesses were able to generate interest, and generate leads using social media platforms  in particular Facebook. Twitter was also starting to show some real interesting stuff. Then as the year progressed, we just saw more and more that when small businesses are out there trying to get the word out  they were beginning to do it very effectively through social platforms. For us, about the middle of last year, our thesis was pretty clear that we could not afford to just go and develop it on our own. We needed to go and get the expertise and then the innovation and the thinking that others had spent a few years putting into it. And the best way for us to do that was to acquire a company. Frankly, we were a little bit smitten by their understanding, their expertise and their true understanding that it is not just about capturing a lead. Its about nurturing that lead. Developing relationship with that lead. The combination of social lead generation and CRM, in their mind, was so powerful. As they began talking about what their future plans were, it was so similar to what the way we thought about nurturing leads and customers through CRM, and sales and marketing automation. We were just impressed with their deep understanding of social media for small businesses. The most important thing was the culture of the company. It really felt like it would be a successful integration and acquisitions usually succeed or fail based on the culture of the integration. It was very clear to me that this could be a good win in terms of our cultures. Thats as true as can be, my friend. Sure, I totally understand it. Its the norm and its definitely not what we are doing. We are totally focused, more than ever, on serving true small business. That is a really great question. We dont right now. But we do think there is a chance that could evolve and help us to get more into retail. Where traditionally, we are much more focused on service businesses. Our initial push with GroSocial and the integration of what we are doing will be about serving the same kind of customers we are serving today. Yet we have a sneaking suspicion that down the road, it could help us get into the businesses where the average ticket size is smaller, that is typically in the retail space.","Chris Hondros / Getty Economists estimate that private payrolls grew by 165,000 in September, according to Bloomberg. ADP's release comes ahead of the official jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. ""Relative to our a priori assumptions for this morning's ADP report, we would need to see a meaningful miss in the vicinity of 60k - 70k for us to consider altering our nonfarm payroll forecast,"" wrote Deutsche Bank economists in a preview.

The New Jersey native was 57 when she lost her job as a marketing professional, which she had for about 30 years. Instead of panicking or sulking though, Schechter saw it as an opportunity to make a living doing what she loved. She launched in 2011. The bakery sells what Schechter describes as a fusion between cookies and pies. She makes them in a variety of flavors, including chocolate chip, almond raspberry, and rocky road. Its an old family recipe, so Schechter says she takes great pride in the product as well. But even though she enjoys baking, it wasnt necessarily an easy path for her to take. She had to take money from her retirement fund to invest in the business. She also had to rent space in a commercial bakery and set up a home office where she could process and ship orders. She recently with The Huffington Post about the challenges of starting her career over: Schechters background is in marketing, not baking, so many of the business aspects that went along with starting Barbaras Cookie Pies came easily to her. However, she said that things like manufacturing, production, and eCommerce were new to her. She also had to adapt to commercial baking since she was used to mainly baking as a hobby. So while it was definitely a challenge and a risk, Schechter said that its been worth it for her to continue learning and growing. When she was let go at 57, she wasnt ready to retire. But instead of allowing a job loss to defeat her, she saw it as an opportunity. Now, she says the business is doubling in size annually. She fills orders for individuals and major retailers alike. That never would have happened if she hadnt taken that initial risk and jumped into entrepreneurship.","Last week on SmallBizTrends we discussed some of the new designed to increase communication between brands and users.  As a SMB owner myself, I was really pleased with the announced upgrades. I felt they addressed many of the long-standing frustrations I had and it was nice to see Facebook tackle so many of them at once.  Now that Facebook has upgraded its platform for brands, that means you should absolutely head over there and create a page for your small business, right? Well, not exactly. Just because Facebook has made important upgrades to its platform, doesnt mean its a place you need to be.  Below are a few reasons you shouldnt create a presence on Facebook.  Feel free to replace Facebook with Twitter, blogging or that other social media site as you see fit.  Because, really, the same rules apply. Youve heard it a million times  the only thing worse than having no presence on a social media site is having a BAD one.  And its the truth.  Creating a Facebook brand page means making the choice to invest valuable time and resources into Facebook instead of putting them somewhere else.  To create a strong Facebook presence youll need a person (or a group of people) that can create content, start conversations, respond to interactions, moderate activity and more.  If you dont have the time to participate in Facebook or youre not interested in devoting the time to it, then dont create the initial page.   Because once its there, you have to manage it.   Otherwise it collects dust and shows users that youre really not paying attention. It would not be wise to assume that your audience is on Facebook simply because marketers love talking about it.  As a small business owner, its a waste of your time and money to invest in a site thats not going to convert for you or that wont help you to build awareness.  You want to make smart choices when .  To help you do that, its worth spending some time looking at your analytics, your referrer logs and even asking your customers which social networks they use before you simply hop on and create a presence. Otherwise you may be buying a dress for the wrong party. Not every small business will benefit from creating a social media presence.  If youre the type of business that has to run everything through legal or corporate or PR before you publish it, then social media may become a bottleneck that your business could do without.  Or perhaps you dont to interact with your customers. If thats the case, then there might be a better way for you to get your message out then forcing someone in your company to be social. If social media doesnt align with your business goals, then dont feel pressured to set up shop. Its not just the daily interactions and updating that can take time away from a small business owner, you also have to factor in the time involved staying up-to-date with Facebooks constant changes and updates.  Creating a presence on Facebook means you have to be aware when Facebook , only to .  You have to know what the best practices are today, compared to what they were a year ago.  Because things change fast in social  media.  If youre not watching, you may miss something and accidentally get your brand in trouble or miss out on a prime opportunity. Obviously the rules above dont apply to just Facebook. Before you invest in any social media or marketing channel for your business, you want to establish a clear reason for what youre doing and an understanding of how youll use that site/platform to reach your goals.   Dont assume you need a Facebook page just because everyone is talking about it.  Do your homework and have a purpose for being there.","Twitter is huge and we all know it. For me, Twitter has become the ultimate place for me to get the best information out there for my industry. I only follow people that provide information that will educate me along with perhaps, 5 friends. I only follow 285 people. Why does this matter? Well get to that in a bit. But first, those new to Twitter sometimes automatically assume that someone with large follower numbers, meaning the number of people that follow a Twitter user, could be someone they need to follow. In some cases that is true and in many cases it is not. If you are using Twitter to find good information for your business and industry, than you may want to only select a few people to follow. If your goal is to get a lot of Twitter followers for whatever reason, than you could follow a lot of people and see who follows you back. Figure out why you want to use Twitter and what your goal is. If you are looking for entertainment, than using Twitter can be fairly simple. But if you are looking to follow people that can offer you the type of information and ideas you are looking for  then you need to choose people to follow carefully. There are a lot of folks out there with tens of thousands of followers, but they also follow tens of thousands of people. It is fairly easy to get a lot of followers when you follow a lot of people. Therefore, having a lot of followers doesnt automatically mean that the person has good information to share or can offer you any value. If you check out someone like , a man deeply respected in the SEO industry, you will see that as of right now he has 295,049 followers and he follows 3,186. It is quite obvious that Danny didnt follow a lot of people to get this large number of followers. He has a large following because he offers great information, he is respected and he is who most of us consider to be one of the top dogs in our industry. When Danny tweets, talks or writes  we all retweet, listen and clip to Evernote. If you see that someone has 5,000 followers, but follows 200 then you can assume that a good number of people believe that person has something valuable to offer on Twitter. You can follow them and see if they do. If they dont you can just unfollow them (give them a week before you decide). There are many people out there with less than 5-10K followers with great information to provide. Normal people dont have celeb follower numbers. When I first started using Twitter, I had about 40 known industry writers that I immediately followed. That obviously wasnt a lot, but I didnt want a lot of junk I had to sift through. I wanted great information that would give me what I was looking for. So I watched the Twitter stream and observed, for months, who the people I followed spoke with  and also who they followed. This is how I found some of the best people out there to provide me with the information I really need and want. In April of this year, I will have been on Twitter for 5 years. I have met a ton of people in those 5 years and have made a lot of industry friends at conferences and online. However, I dont follow them all on Twitter because I use Twitter for a specific purpose, to get information. Above I mentioned that I only follow 285 people and this is why. I choose carefully and I believe that the people I follow offer me fantastic information daily. I do add people from time to time, but if they are not educating me  I dont have an interest in their Twitter stream. I add friendly folks that I have personally met to Facebook and I engage there. But Twitter is a business and education tool for me. Dont be fooled by some people claiming they are hot shots on Twitter because they have a lot of followers. It is easy to get  and even buy  followers. Choose people that provide you with what you need and find people that others respect. You can see who gets respect in the follower / following ratio. I also want to say that there are some people/businesses out there that have an almost equal number of followers / following that offer fantastic information. They sometimes put everyone they follow into defined lists that educated them or meet their needs. I am not saying to rule out people with an equal ration. I am just saying  dont be fooled by those with large follower numbers. Make sure whoever you follow meets your goals and wants on Twitter.","t Ambit we spend a lot of time reading articles that are not    directly relevant to Indian stocks. However, since the Indian economy is    now umbilically linked to its global counterparts, the articles that   we  come across have relevance for Indian stocks and the Indian  economy.  In  that context, this report contains the ten most  interesting pieces  that  we read this week. Here are the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week, ended August 26, 2016. 1) The seven immutable laws of investing [ Source: GMO ] The legendary James Montier of GMO is at his best in this insightful paper as he presents seven principles of sensible investing. Some of the most impactful principles highlight the importance of margin of safety while investing and how the this time is different  approach is extremely dangerous. He also shares his concerns around the current artificially stimulated rally in global equities and bonds alike and believes cash is the best bet today! 2) Is greed good? No, its seriously bad for your wealth [ Source: Financial Times ] Greed is good said Gordon Gekko in the famous 1980s movie, Wall Street. Now, fresh research, produced by State Streets centre for applied research, suggests that greed is not good after all. In fact, avarice can be seriously bad for our wealth. The study uses State Streets Investor Love for Money scale (ILOM), and found that the more someone had an emotional attachment to money, the more likely they were to make mistakes with money. The avaricious were more likely to buy at the top and sell at the bottom  which for investors is the cardinal sin, worse than all others. They also had shorter time horizons and were more inclined to hyperactive investing behaviour. Interestingly, the study also found that while Avarice is universal, it differs according to economic development with countries like India featuring in top of the list. 3) Alternative data firms are shedding new light on corporate performance [ Source: The Economist ] Given that financial statements are both infrequent and backwards-looking, getting a sense for how a business is performing in the present can be nearly impossible. This article highlights how to counter this, a cottage industry of a few dozen firms, mostly in America, is gleaning alternative data from novel sources - ranging from satellite images to obscure corners of social media. The growth of small, low-cost satellites and machine learning means companies can quickly and cheaply parse millions of satellite images a day. A common trick is to analyze photos of car parks outside big-box retailers such as Walmart to get a sense of daily revenues. A Chicago-based data firm, RS Metrics, sells estimates on the productivity of factories by tracking the number of lorries parked outside. 4) Centuries old sharks hold the secret to a longer life [ Source: Financial Times ] This piece highlights how a recent discovery of Greenland sharks that can live upto 400 years has started afresh the discussion on whether human lifespan could be extended dramatically. It discusses how human lifespan can be materially increased given that scientists found that mice could be engineered to live 35 per cent longer simply by clearing ageing cells from the body. 5) Robotics and virtual reality help heal spinal injuries [ Source: Financial Times ] This piece discusses how a clinical breakthrough, outlined in a US-Brazilian study published recently, shows how new technology combined with intensive long-term training could help patients paralysed by spinal cord injury to stimulate internal changes in their body and rehabilitate their nerves and muscles. One of the patients in the study, who had been paralysed for 13 years, was able to move her legs on her own after 13 months of training. The researchers use a brain-machine interface linked to various devices, including a virtual reality system that enabled paraplegics to simulate control of their paralysed legs. 6) The economics of marriage [ Source: LiveMint ] This article dives into the argument that people marry because it makes economic sense. It was in 1970s that this idea originated when Nobel Prize-winning economist Gary Becker first postulated an economic model of marriage, arguing that marriage was based on the principle of division of labour, and that gains from marriage were determined by how efficient this division was. The Beckerian model also said that in a marriage the one with comparative advantage at earning wages will go out and work; the other person has to do the dishes and probably stay at home. The article goes on to discuss some of the presumptions in the model and how the research in recent times has put these to test. 7) Office workers can learn from the Olympians [ Source: Financial Times ] As per this piece if there is one thing that distinguishes the Olympians from the average worker carrying out daily tasks it is this: practice. For athletes, training seems to make up 99 per cent of their existence against the 1 per cent of time spent competing in events that the public get to see. For most office workers, by contrast, a little training is quite enough and a ferocious desire to do more would be considered distinctly odd. It goes on to highlight that financial incentives are not so useful in encouraging people to complete the complex tasks of the modern workplace and that what really gives athletes the motivation to work so hard continues to remain a topic that needs to be researched further. 8) Indians spurn snacks, shampoo to load their smartphones [ Source: WSJ ] Consumer-goods companies in India are not thrilled with the countrys smartphone revolution. Now that their poorest customers have started spending on smartphone data, they have fewer pennies left over for snacks, sodas and shampoo. According to local mom and shop owners, kids have switched from spending their pocket money on chips and chocolates to data recharge. However, these companies have found ways to cope with this effect. Godrej Consumer Products has this year begun giving consumers beauty and hair-colouring tips on prerecorded mobile calls. In return, it said, consumers who answered and listened to these calls the most would stand a chance to win a free smartphone. HUL has invented a free mobile radio station that that lets callers dial in to hear popular Bollywood tracks. Breaks between songs are interspersed with ads for Lux soap and Brooke Bond tea, among other Unilever products. 9) An Indian state may be on the brink of recession because of the Gulf oil crisis [ Source: qz.com ] As per this piece, the global oil slump is wreaking havoc in Kerala. This southern Indian state has built an enviable record of human development indicators thanks to decades of abundant remittances from the oil-rich Arabian Gulf. Now these remittances, which form 36% of Keralas net domestic product, are drying up. According to Keralas finance minister Thomas Isaac theres going to be a very serious regional recession in this state of over 33 million people. 10) What drives Team GBs medal machine? [ Source: Spectator.co.uk ] Writing a story about the once prevalent sporting culture in Great Britain, the author talks about how rather than a lack of winning mentality in Britain, the reason for bad performance at international sporting events like Olympics was lack of a winning system: too much of British sport was a gentlemanly muddle. As a way to turn things around, UK Sport didnt just look for decent athletes and back them. It also looked for sports in which Britain had a serious chance of winning a medal - sports that would fall to a full-scale assault of money and talent. It wasnt about funding individuals and teams to fulfill their potential, it wasnt about the pure quest for excellence and it had nothing to do with idealism. It was about medals. - Saurabh Mukherjea is CEO (Institutional Equities) and Prashant   Mittal is Analyst (Strategy and Derivatives) at Ambit Capital Pvt Ltd.  Views  expressed are personal.

It has been found that the majority of online shoppers search for products and product information on one device and then switch to another device to continue their purchase process. Here lies the importance of multi-screen shopping. I am sure you simply hate to leave your shopping experience incomplete. For example, an evening gown on mobile that can only be acquired once you complete the purchase process on a desktop. This can be really annoying. To prevent this, online merchants should consider a multi-screen strategy to make their shoppers experience enjoyable.The following diagram from Marketing Land shows that : Clearly, some consistency is necessary to make the shopping experience and enjoyable one for your customers. So how can you begin to do that? Below are some suggestions. Taking a closer look at how consumers react to the multi-screen world will help you design a responsive site. But why a responsive site? Every online retailer wants to organize the content so that it can be easily read, seen and used, regardless of the types of device and the size of the screen. A responsive site puts emphasis on providing the shoppers with the same useful content whether they see it through their tablet, PC or smartphone. Buying decisions can change if your customer finds it difficult to access a product through their device. An online store without can suffer severely. According to Google, smartphones are now the backbone of daily media interaction. Mobile phones are a common starting point for the highest number of user interactions. As people are interested in learning about new apps, help them also get familiar with any new apps to find your products. Your app should provide value and they should find the app interesting enough to visit your online store again and again. Offer visitors useful, valuable content. To encourage repeat purchases, your content should win attention. Content plays a major role in presenting the product description and images successfully on your site. In a nutshell, your site content should aim at helping the customers. They should find the content easy to view and understand. Most importantly, keep the same content for a desktop computer that is available on a tablet or smartphone. Your customers will be more than pleased to see that your site has been optimized for swiping and touch. Dont disappoint with different versions of a same content across different devices. For instance, a shopper that sees one of his favorite sought after items suddenly available on his desktop enthusiastically informs one of his friends the item is now available. The friend is excited, only to find that his current device for purchase, a smartphone, does not have the same item available. This becomes a truly disappointing shopping experience. You need to have a consistent message throughout all your channels. At the same time, you need to be faster and more concise in your message, having several people accessing your sites content via different screens simultaneously. Do not make them wade through a lot of messages to get to what theyre after. Hit them with an offer right away. But when it comes to pop up ads, they can be disastrous for many devices. The best way is to use responsive design that can convert any pop-up into a banner or any other form on various devices such as tablets, PCs and smartphones. Using separate domains for different versions of your website is not recommended. It usually has a negative impact on your stores search engine ranking and more importantly on branding. Incorporating various domains can be quite confusing to shoppers. Are you giving your customers a fluid, enjoyable shopping experience across multiple devices?","With the rise of local, mobile and the social Web, small business owners have a lot on their plates in terms of marketing to customers.  With so many options and avenues, you want to make sure youre using the services and the platforms that your customers are gravitating toward, while also staying on top of trends. But how do you do that? You do it by seeking out data. Lucky for us, we didnt have to do too much research to find out just how many million users are flocking to Yelp via their mobile phones each month. Last week Yelp released some that small business owners should take note of.  According to the data: As a marketer and SMB, theres a lot of useful information tucked inside those statistics.  For example, the data show that Yelpers arent passive about their searching, especially when coming from a mobile application. Theyre engaged, theyre on a mission, and if you can entice them via a Yelp check-in offer or a Yelp Special, theyre going to click on your listing and make contact.  This is something were constantly seeing with mobile users (that theyre searchers on a mission), and its once again reaffirmed here. I was also interested in seeing that more than a third of Yelps searches are coming from mobile applications, because it gives us a sense of real search numbers associated with mobile. Were far beyond the days when it was just the ubergeeks with their smartphones surfing while on the go.  Mobile now has a mainstream audience and, as a result, small business owners need to be there. As an SMB, what does all this information mean? Two things: :  After years of false hope that would be the year of mobile, the year of mobile is and it is right now.  With Yelp now claiming 3.2 million mobile users and Google recently releasing a , mobile is seeing real activity. And it will only gain more momentum as Google enters the fray and users become more adept at searching via mobile devices.  As an SMB, if youre not taking advantage of mobile now, youre already behind the rest of the pack.   Your business should be as widely represented on the mobile Web as it is on the traditional Web. :  Im a really big fan of Yelp. As a small business owner myself, I think they provide an enormous opportunity to appeal to motivated users and to use discounts or special offers to lower the barrier to conversion.   With more than 15 million reviews, theres a good chance that your current customers are there talking about you, and that others are there looking for information about you.  By taking advantage of like check-in offers and better mobile tracking, you can reach out to customers at the exact moment theyre searching for you and get the intel you need to create better offers and incentives. The data is another sign of both the power of mobile and the power of Yelp as a platform to connect with users.  If youre a small business owner, Id encourage you to pay attention to both.","Not so long ago, Yelp received quite a bit of attention when they began left on the site.  It was something SMB owners and others had been salivating for. And for good reason.  Review sites and local search have changed the way your customers are discovering you and helping them make important purchasing decisions. If your company is who your customers say it is, then these online reviews play a pretty crucial part in giving them that voice. And you need to be listening. Let me share a quick story. A good friend of mine was recently researching movers as shell be moving into a new home this weekend.  Just like your own customers are prone to do, she started off by performing a local search in Google.  That search presented her with a Google 10-pack, listing the names of ten moving companies, their phone numbers, URLs and links to existing customer reviews.  She started from the top, clicking on the review for the moving company listed first in the search.  The listing had one review  it was negative, citing several customer service complaints. It was the only review on the page and the company in question never bothered to respond.  That company immediately lost the sale. Online reviews often act as immediate, in-the-moment for your company when someone is trying to make a decision. They can help with search engine rankings and work to establish trust and brand recognition. You need to be monitoring your online reviews so that you can be proactive about managing them. Your first step to managing online reviews is to know where people are leaving them.  For most small businesses, this simply means covering the basics.  You want to focus the bulk of your attention on the bigger name sites, as this is where most of your customers will naturally be hanging out and it will help you avoid spending too many hours trolling around the Internet. Id recommend monitoring these sites for online reviews: Reviews on these sites are also the ones most often aggregated by other search engines. By addressing them head on, youll get double the benefit and visibility. You should also check for any large niche review sites by doing a search for [industry name + review]. You may find that your industry has its own, very active niche sites.  [For example, if youre in the travel industry, youll want to check sites like Trip Advisor.] Its very important that you monitor the sites most important to your industry as these sites will often have the most credibility for your niche. Once you know where people are leaving reviews, make it easy to continually by automating the process as much as possible.  If youre on Yelp, use the option to subscribe to the page via RSS so that youre alerted each time its updated.  Set up Google Alerts to watch your name.  Most sites make it really easy to get updates via RSS or email. You want to take advantage of this to help keep yourself in the loop. If you need some help, I recently detailed an extensive plan for . You may want to check that post out for a more extensive plan. As social media continues to take off and the search engines are using reviews as a factor in their local algorithms, its really important that small businesses take the time to monitor whats out there and help manage any negative reviews that may develop.   As my friend helped show, it means nothing if your site shows up first for a query if a negative review is there to scare people away. And because many small businesses wont see too many reviews, it only takes one or two bad ones to send wary customers flying in the other direction.","One of the world's best video game consoles just turned 20 years old.

You probably dont think this could ever happen to you. Blogger Jordan Reid didnt think it could happen to her either  but it did. It started when Reid received a YouTube notification that someone had signed in to her account using a different device. She thought nothing of it at the time. She assumed instead she had just signed in on a mobile device or that her husband had used her account. Then Reid received an email from someone who said they were interested in purchasing her website. Again, she disregarded the notice, this time assuming it was spam. Then a friend of a friend told her he saw a listing for her website, , on an auction website. Reid didnt immediately consider this to be a huge problem either. That is until she discovered that the ownership of her website had actually been transferred to someone else without her knowledge. In a recent Mashable post, Reid why this theft was such a huge deal to her and her business: Getting control of her site back wasnt as easy as she thought it would be, either. She first tried going through her hosting and domain providers, but her attempts were not successful. She even got in touch with the FBI, since the theft qualified as an international cyber crime issue. The FBI opened an investigation and it is still ongoing. She eventually got her website back by dealing directly with the seller. She asked the family friend who originally found the listing for her site to get in touch with the seller to negotiate a sale. They reached an agreement, and Reid authorized a wire transfer not knowing for sure whether she would actually get her site back. When she gained control of the site again, she cancelled the payment. And finally the nightmare was over. So Reid did get her site back within a few days, but not without considerable drama. Of course, she would have preferred to avoid this situation altogether. So she offers some tips for website owners who want to avoid the same thing happening to them. Reid warns business owners should choose a strong password and change it often. She also recommends using a separate computer, if possible, in case family members accidentally click bad links. Turn off your computer and other devices when not in use. Utilize anti-virus software and purchase CyberRisk insurance. Your website is likely a very important part of your business. So website theft can be an absolutely devastating blow. It might not seem very likely that this could happen to you. But knowing how to avoid this situation can keep you from losing everything youve built online.","At the start of every project, hopes are always high. Expectations will be exceeded.

Previously, businesses that advertised on Twitter could only upload one individual ad at a time, and they had to do so through Twitter itself rather than using their marketing agency or ad management platform. With this latest change, businesses will be able to work with Twitters partner companies to create more in-depth and targeted ad campaigns to run on Twitter, as well as integrate Twitter advertising into broader marketing strategies across a variety of sites and platforms. Twitters API launch partners include , , , , and TGB Digital, which have built on the platform and will begin offering new Twitter advertising options to a limited number of their clients. The company said that it has been testing the ads API with its partners since January. In addition, Twitter is for more companies interested in using the API in the future. Aside from creating a larger revenue base for Twitter, the release of its API could also lead to an influx of ads on the site and apps, which has some users worried. However, Facebook has been giving marketers access to its API for years and hasnt reported many ill effects. Facebook first began testing its own in 2009 and has since allowed marketers to create automated ad campaigns that integrate a number of different advertising products. It has also given marketers the ability to create tools for measuring the impact of certain ads, when the best time to run ads might be, and what groups are the best fit to target. Overall, this is good news for advertisers, as they will have more options to reach consumers on Twitter and they could also save time in managing their overall ad campaigns as they will no longer have to manage Twitter ads separately and manually.","Big chain food stores have done a tremendous amount of research on how people shop. Today in these huge food stores, marketing is primarily transactional. That means there is a minimum amount of personal communication between the customer and the stores staff. Location, lighting, and packaging take the place of person-to-person interaction. These big box retailers need to know how customers shop because they arent particularly interested in having salespeople on the floor. Salespeople cost more than clerks. How do they entice customers to spend money? Easy. They put the milk in the back of the store forcing the shopper to wend his/her way through all manner of enticing goodies before getting to the milk, which is why he/she came to the store in the first place. But thats just the beginning. Here are some other things their research has told them: The vast majority of people entering any retail store look left and turn right. The grocery store puts the bakery on the right. Why? It smells good. Smell is purely emotional, not intellectual. Once past the bakery the shopper comes upon the fresh fruit and vegetable section. This area has mirrors, water, bright colored fruits and veggies. By now the customer is salivating and ready to go up and down the isles on a shopping spree. Another thing learned by these same retailers is that women look down not up. And men look up not down. Ive been told these actions are a result of our ancestors. Back in the dawn of human time, men hunted food in the trees while women tended the children and food growing on the ground. How do the grocery stores use this information? They and their suppliers know that food products placed on a shelf about three to four feet above the floor have the greatest sale potential. They also know that few women buy exotic high-priced foods but men do. That knowledge leads them to put these things high on the shelf. It works. Shoppers enter the store, look left and turn right. Men look up, women down. It seems simple enough but its also one of marketings best-kept secrets  until now. Can other non-grocery stores benefit from these unique human foibles? Sure. It works in any retail environment where the customer can ply the aisles. The product lines could include books, hardware, clothes, recreational products. It works for just about anything that is displayed on shelves in a self-service environment.","Youre on a business trip overseas, you brought your phone and tablet and now you need to charge them. The problem is your charger wont fit in the outlets. This is a common frustration that many jetsetters face and probably have already found a solution for with the use of plug adapters. Plug adapters are not a new concept. However, the makers of the MU System think they have found a way to improve on the humble power plug adapter. , the company behind the MU System, claim itsnew product is the worlds thinnest international phone charger. Made In Mind started with creating the . This USB charger isnt an international plug solution but rather a more streamlined international phone chargerfor UK outlets. Min-Kyu Choi, the creator of the MU classic, found a problem with his laptop becoming scratched from his charger while in his bag. He wanted to find a way to stop this from happening. Chois solution was to create a folding plug design, later known as the MU. When not in use, the MU closes to look something like a rectangle with rounded edges. The front can be opened to reveal the plug prongs that can then be twisted into place. The company boasts that this design reduces the typical plug size by 70 percent. With Chois design he and business partner Matthew Judkins founded Made In Mind and have been selling the MU for the last several years. There is a catch though, the MU international phone charger is currently only available in the UK and Ireland. The team wanted to find a way to reach global markets and so the MU System was born. Aside from being only 14mm thick, the MU System also has four interchangeable plug attachments. These attachments come with some cute names: The Brit, The American, The European, and The Aussie. Made In Mind claims itsplug attachments fit every socket type worldwide. But if you are not an international traveler and just like the idea of a compact charger, the attachments can be purchased individually to fit your needs. The company boasts itscharger is compatible with most smartphones, tablets, MP3 players, and other USB-charged devices. They also claim the MU System has an embedded auto-detect chip that identifies the connected device to deliver optimum charging. To launch the MU System, the company is an Indiegogo campaign.

The report covering 2012 reveals that small businesses spend about 24 percent more per year on these expenses than bigger companies. The report is a survey of Concur users and how much they spent annually on travel and entertainment. The study also specifies some reasons for that disparity: Items like baggage fees on flights and other ancillary charges for business travelers nearly doubled in the last year, the study found. Concur users spent $58 million on these fees in 2012, compared to $30 million the year prior. Despite the amount of these fees, which are the same for big or small businesses, its small businesses that are paying more often. The report also found that small businesses purchase 37 percent more airline tickets in a quarter than big businesses. Even if your business travel doesnt require flight, small businesses are paying more for hotel rooms and rental cars, too. The average small business traveler will spend about $736 per quarter, compared to a big business travelers $608 per quarter for lodging. Other expenses on the ground also hit small businesses harder. A small business traveler is dining out about 40 times a year and spends around $340 every three months on take-out or restaurant meals. The big business traveler eats out less often and typically spends less too. The study found that each small business traveler will spend about $500 more per quarter than a big business traveler.

A lot has changed since the last time we , so we decided to interview Mike again. This time, we will talk more about local Internet marketing holistically, and how it relates to your business. We are certain you will think differently about local search after this interview. The first thing is understanding the medium. It offers benefits (and some drawbacks) compared to offline. But understanding it requires education. Every business should learn what the online options are and how they fit into an integrated marketing plan (see ). The great benefit of web marketing is that it is more easily trackable and thus accountable. Whether offline or on, a business should be able to calculate the ROI on their investment. Some online choices, like Yelp, are impression based and end up as expensive as offline media. But if it targets your demographic well (Yelp does a good job of targeting urban 20-35 year olds) and delivers customers it might provide a good return.

What works with their customers and what works with their targeted age groups. Example: in the Midwest and particularly in rural markets, the print Yellow Pages are still very effective. The trick is to understand the value of each marketing choice and attempt to create a mix that provides good exposure and client acquisition at the lowest price. Offline and online are complementary in many ways. The mantra used to be make yourself visible to your customers. Now the mantra needs to be make yourself visible to your customers both off-line and online. Barbara Oliver & Co Jewelry is a good example. She has two demographics; older wealthy women and young, soon to be married young men that need help with picking an engagement ring. She targets one with local television and the other with Internet efforts. But the reality is that the TV ads also drive Internet activity as well, as people see the TV ad and then go to the Internet to look her up. If Google assesses searcher behavior and click throughs to affect rank as we think they do, then the result is very synergistic. I think Google local should be a strong and initial focus of every business that has a strong local focus. While in general search they may have 65% market share, in local search it is much higher. Once the initial 3-6 month effort is made in local search, a business can turn their efforts elsewhere. Often times the effect of a strong local push can last for several years depending on market dynamics There is a danger that focusing on reviews detracts from focusing on the real questions: customer satisfaction and running a business that truly delights its clients. Reviews have a very small effect on rank, but a huge effect on conversions. And thus their role should be in the context of the bigger picture of ongoing improvement at a business rather than a goal in and of itself. If you do a great job of running your business AND follow up with your clients, you will get your fair share of reviews with a simple ask. The Pigeon Update, as it is known, fits into the bigger picture of changes at Google. They have been reducing the number of images and visual distractions in the main search results with efforts like removing author photos, dramatically reducing the number of video snippets and, with the Pigeon Update, the reduction of the number of results that show the Local Pack results. (Local pack refers toa part of the Googlesearch result page that shows the businesss name, address, phone number and a map.) They have also, in many cases, reduced the radius of the search area used to display results. There were winners and losers with Pigeon. Regardless, it means that it has become more difficult to show in the Local Pack results for many business, particularly those in the suburbs. It is probably time to review your local strategy; which categories are you in, which things are you focusing on organically vs. local categories. It might mean that a business needs to focus on longer tail local phrases to regain their visibility in the pack. It really doesnt change a businesss overall strategy  which should include a mix of Local, Organic, PPC and offline marketing efforts. Obviously, as a founder of Local U, I am a big believer in education. Whether the business decides to do it themselves or hire someone, they need to understand the many online options, how they work, how they work together and they need to know enough to choose between one and the other. When should they do local search marketing? SEO? Facebook ads? It all depends and the business needs to know in a broad sense what they do and when they are most appropriate. Accountability and transparency. There is a lot of snake oil and it is important: 1) to know what is being done in your name, and 2) to be able to measure the results that you are paying for. The Internet is all about scale. And about the network effect. As a result, most users tend to end up at the same sites, but the specifics of that are very age and demographic dependent, much like offline. The business needs to know who their customers are and the best way to reach their particular age and interest group.","As a follow up to my last piece titled  , I felt it was important to point out the flipside: credibility killers. In many ways credibility killers are even more important because it only takes being guilty of one cred killer and all your hard earned credibility could be out the window. So, lets begin: When checking out a persons professional background and cred online, LinkedIn is often the first stop for me. It amazes me how little effort some people invest in it. To have good cred your profile has to present you in the best possible light. That means it needs to be filled out completely and accurately. Many folks simply dont know about all the bells and whistles (like videos, Slideshares, etc.) that they can use to spice up a profile. It also helps to have more than one or two testimonials. Need more? Then try giving more. And please, make sure your information is accurate, grammatically correct, and devoid of typos. When I say a bad website I mean a website thats unprofessional. That means broken links, bad grammar, a lack of design, etc. One of the worst things you can do is point out the fact that you dont have your act together with a lame, Sorry, our new site is under construction. Come back soon. Many folks start a blog with the best intentions only to lose steam after a year or two. So, when its the middle of summer and your last post talks about building a snowman, youre gonna look bad. In fact, youll look bad even if the only obvious thing is that you havent posted in a few months. Blogs are like plants, they need to be watered. If they arent, theyll look bad and make you look bad. Yea, I know they screwed up on their IPO, but thats not a reason to ignore the power and influence of Facebook. The fact is that if you have a business, product, service, organization, etc. and you dont have a dedicated page for it on Facebook  you just killed your credibility. Not only should you have a page, but it should be as cool, engaging and informative as possible. Unprofessional behavior can take many forms online, from an embarrassing rant on a blog post, to an Anthony Weiner moment on Twitter. Be smart about what you do and say. Remember, the Webis an exciting place. Its also unforgiving. Be sure you learn the rules of engagement for every online platform you use and always keep your professional image in mind.","Are your employees sitting at their desks all day? If so, chances are theyre not maximizing their productivityand they could be racking up your health insurance costs. The has officially recommended that employers not let employees sit all day. AMA board member, Dr. Patrice Harris, said when announcing the recommendation: If youre looking to build a healthier workforce (one that wont have as many accidents and illnesses, and saves you money on health insurance and workers comp), consider ways to make yourself and your team more active at work. The simplest and cheapest way to increase employee activity is to create company-wide exercise breaks. Consider having employees download online tools like: You can also encourage employees to take regular breaks to check out online yoga videos such as and and do some advanced stretching in the office. Of course, sometimes its hard to know if employees are actually taking those breaks. One way to get everyone moving is to make it a group activity. Every hour, announce a stretch break and have someone lead everyone in some simple stretches, toe touches, jumping jacks or other quick energizer for 60 seconds. This works best if youve got a small office with everyone in one area, but you can also make the announcement and lead the activity over the P.A. system. One of the most productive changes you can make is to hold standing meetings. Instead of sitting around a conference table (is there any bigger energy-suck?), gather everyone in a common area to stand up for a short (15 to 30 minutes) meeting. Standing means everyones motivated to keep the meeting moving so they can get back to their desks. Youll get more done in less timeand because people are more energized, youll probably get better ideas out of the group, too. To really kick it up a notch, graduate to walking meetingsbest held outside, these should also be brief, but can be a great way to energize while brainstorming or discuss sensitive issues you dont want others in the office to overhear. If employees respond well to the low- or no-cost options above, it might be time to invest a little money in equipment that helps keep them moving. There are a wide range of options for standing desks, from ones you build yourself to desks that adjust from a standing to sitting position. Unless you or your employees use laptops that you can easily move from one desk to another, an is probably the most practical choice, since most people wont want to stand all day. Want to support a small business? Check out adjustable desks, and the test-drive of six standing desk options (which includes an assessment of their goofiness factor). You might want to test the standing option first before you consider a treadmill desk, since this can be a pricey investment. To save money, consider buying just one and letting people take turns on it using their laptops. Steelcase offers a wide range of what it calls walkstations, or you can support an entrepreneurial company by buying a . Whatever option you choose to get your team moving: Dont pressure people who dont want to participate. Some employees may feel shy about doing a downward dog in the office. Others may not be up to racing alongside you at a walking meeting. Match the effort to the employees abilities. For instance, people using standing desks often feel more comfortable with a small footstool or yoga block that they can put one foot up on to vary their position. (As anyone whos worked retail knows, standing for eight straight hours a day can cause just as many health problems as sitting.) The money you save in having healthier employees could get eaten up in workers comp costs if someone falls off a treadmill. Make sure employees know the proper way to use the equipment, and dont encourage an unsafe level of multi-tasking.","Being locked in for two years was basically the norm for mobile contracts, but the changing landscape of the industry is forcing companies to reassess this model. While T-Mobile and its brash CEO might have made the most noise with its Uncarrier marketing, CountVerizonasbeing the latest to do so. Starting August 13, Verizon stoppedsubsidizing phones, and its newest price plan will kick in by offering four pricing tiers fordata allocation: What if you want more than 12GB? There are options starting at $120 for 20GB and going all the way up to $750 for 100GB, but the company is not promoting these options as strongly as it is the new plan. The new Verizon monthly billing plan doesnt have the traditional two-year contract, and if you want to buy a phone, you either pay for it up front or make monthly payments. The difference between the old format and the new is thatyou dont have to make a down payment of $200 or pay a $40 activation fee. Those costs arent involved with the newer plans from Verizon. With that in mind, how can you make the most out of the new plans? First, the more data you buy, the more money you will save. So, if what kept you from upgrading to a higher tier data plan in the past was a matter of between $10 and $40, you can now do it. Here is the breakdown: If you have your own phone or the contract is up on it, the best option is to keep the device and buy the XL package. Currently, you are paying $140 and under the new plan it will go down to $100, saving you $40 a month. Under the Large plan (with6GB of high-speed data) you would save $30. The Medium (3GB) goes down by$25 and the 1GB Small plan saves you $20. For customers under the Edge plan, which was Verizonsprevious no-contract plan, the savings will not be as dramatic. You will save $5 a month for all the tiers except the 3GB rate, which goes up to $10. So, how will getting rid of the subsidies affect customers and manufacturers? Paying $600 or more upfront for a smartphone will be a bit much for most people, and it will have an impact on high-end devices. We will have to wait until the next quarter to see the moves manufacturers make to adjust to this new environment in the industry. Compared to the old two-year contracts, the new Verizon monthly billing plan will give you the flexibility to move your device to a different carrier and not worry about early termination fees, a threat that kept most people locked in to their carrier for two years.","The decision to lift a restriction requiring real names on Google+ will have implications on small business users and marketers too. Google+ has announced a decision to rollback its real names policy. Since it started three years ago, Google+ has pushed heavily for the use of real user names on its platform. Last November, Google pushedeven harder by making it mandatory for all YouTube commenters to sign in with a Google+ profile. This was done in an attempt to clean up and remove all unwanted and otherwise vulgar content from the YouTube commenting system. The move sent YouTube users into a frenzy almost immediately. Many of them claimed Googles real names policy and forced integration on YouTube was part of a . However, with lifting the ban on pseudonyms, it seems Google+ is becoming more open to the idea of having anonymous users. In a post on the official Google+ account, the company : At a time when younger users were fleeing big networks like Facebook like Kik and Snapchat, it seems Google+ was pushing in the wrongdirection. It could be this realization that has given Google+ its newfound acceptance for anonymity. Google+ has received a lot of criticism in the past for its lack of members. Some have even after the resignation of Vic Gundotra, Vice President of Social for Google earlier this year. While it may not be the zombieits often portrayed to be, the network does lack the number of users some of the olderplatforms have. Thats especially true when it comes to younger users. And this is where the removal of the real name requirement may impact small business users and those who use Google+ for marketing the most. If Google+ wants to grow, it will definitely need the help of the younger generation. Removing restrictions like the real names policy should help to do that. The policy change means that YouTube is once again open to anonymous comments too. Thats exactly why Google forced integration on YouTube users in the first place. So does this mean YouTube Comments will go back to what they were before? , chief architect at Google+ says, I dont think so: YouTubers may be the ones affected most by this policy change at first. Existing Google+ users arent likely to change their usernames, especially since many of them are growing brands. And new users will never have to deal with it, unless of course, Google+ changes its mind again. The question is whether the move will spur growth in Google+ membership or simply lead to more spam and other bad behavior that will ultimately make it less useful as a networking and marketing tool."," One of the biggest Venture Capital Firms IvyCap Ventures , through a new wing called IvyCamp , is trying to engage with IITs, IIMs, BITs and ISB as well as industry experts at multiple levels to foster a startup ecosystem in India.  It is connecting alumni across educational institutions to build a network of mentors, investors, and experts, but at the same time also making connections to ensure the guidance and money are pouring into the right startups and innovations arising out of the campuses. For this, the company has been going to Indian B-schools for the past few years now, trying to make relationships with incubators here and helping startups or innovations (from colleges as well as outside) find the right match and resources.  So basically, the potential ideas or entrepreneurs are linked to IvyCamp's startups/investors/mentors network or corporations so that innovations from campuses are more visible, they can be commercialized and startups can leap onto the next level.  While on a tour to IIM Bangalore , we interviewed the Vice President of IvyCamp who is driving this objective in India and globally:      Here are some more insights from the interview on IvyCamp's work so far:  Holding Events On Campus   Adhiraj Banerjee told Business Insider - ""We are doing continuous events at IITs and IIMs and now we are headed to couple of other institutions as well. The idea here is to give the right direction to early stage entrepreneurs who need lot of mentoring in basic areas like how to build your B-plan, how to do your valuation and a sounding board for them.""   Setting up incubators   As a part of their objective to help young innovators and entrepreneurs, IvyCamp is conducting education programmes with colleges and also setting up its own incubators.  ""Just in the last two weeks, we have signed 14 incubators. We are setting incubators in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka and the idea is to not restrict the ecosystem to just the campuses. That means we will be doing the exact same things we are doing in colleges outside as well like pitch events, mentor events, education programmes etc,"" said Adhiraj.   Tie-up with Nasscom 10k Startups Programme   IvyCamp felt the success of IoT startups coming out of India needed a consolidated boost. Adhiraj said - ""This tie-up was therefore done to evangelize IoT and to help startups in this space in India get access to manufacturing units, connect with the industry who may use their applications and also connect them to the foreign governments.""   Efforts to bring angel investors onboard   Another way IvyCamp is trying to help startups is by roping in angel investors along with IvyCap Ventures investing in IvyCamp startups. ""Sometimes we find startups during events or through our outreach programmes which we can be invested in. We have invested in two such startups recently and we are looking to increase that by bringing higher number of investors on the platform.""  It seems like B-school students who wish to become entrepreneurs now have a big reason to smile!","You have to find the translation of comic book heroes into popular movies fascinating. Characters from childhood fantasies have been reimagined to fit every real life concern, from the complication of terrorism that underscores Chris Nolans Batman trilogy to teen angst represented by The Amazing Spiderman. It makes one wonder what does it take to be truly fearless in real life. Michael Carroll seems to believe he has the answer, at least for how we work. Thirty seven years of Buddhist training infuses his career as a human resources executive and professional coach. The thoughts are profoundly captured in his book I discovered the book through NetGalley and requested a copy. Carroll organizes 38 principles based on Tibetan practices (He explains the practices further in an appendix). The principles are eye-opening words for contemplation. Five sections organize the principles to be easy to find: You can read them sequentially, each building on each other. You can also read in your own order, useful for reminders, though Carroll recommends to read the 5 primary slogans. These are meant to help us engage life on our terms, instead of feeling out of control: The principles support any journaling you choose to do in developing ones avocation. Each principle ends with a brief summary paragraph. When digging deeper into the text, be prepared for startling phrases  not sure I would think of myself as a coward, for example, but its the word Carroll uses to get to the heart of vulnerability. It supports the facts of life outline in the primary slogans, so I appreciated the point the author makes  to appreciate a full aware of my life. Acceptance is a hallmark of the first pages, beginning with a listing of ideas supporting the first term, Face the Fierce Facts of Life: Now this is a heavy thought, for sure, but Carroll wisely explains each listing and expand the thought carefully so that jolt from the phrases connects to professional thoughts that everyone has mostly likely entertained in their career: I felt the most applicable thoughts to a reader who owns a small business is Living a Skillful Life. I thought the section spoke to connecting skills to ambitions through a spiritual conversation. Ever met a small business owner who believed so much in their skills or product offering? Im sure you have. Everyone has. And in every case these small businesses truly believe in their business, in some ways similar to an evangelist believing in the life calling. Many segments address behavior to account ones self for undertaking an action. For example, Dont Kick The Dog. I had to brace myself for that phrase. It means do not do something needless to alert people of a superior position you have, a petty action. If you kick the dog, it will bark, which leads to other dogs in the neighborhood barking along. Heres a better explanation of it: You have to read the chapter to learn a how the phrase came to be. Regardless, in simple language, when you are petty, others will know and barker, relay. Youll remember the emotional speedbumps that can impede fearlessness, and as a result, impede productivity and teamwork. Taking a vejra view of aggression  the fluid nature of underlying feelings  shows how to draw upon assertiveness without improper bullying, while part three, Taming the Mind, notes mindful awareness and meditation in establishing a fearless presence. Another segment, Just Slow Down, is a reminder of good judgment not being rushed. Carroll wrote this book, along with , and , to address what it is people really are striving to be personally and professionally  happy, stress-free, fulfilled. Fearless at Work is not meant to provide organizational process, but is a good journal for applying self-introspection in the middle of small business chaos. Like books such as and , does not tell try to interpret situations, but merely provide an overarching viewpoint that you can apply during your daily activities. Once you do, youll feel more like a superhero instead of looking for a hero.","Small businesses loan approvals saw record highs for a third consecutive month in August. Small business loans at bigger banks were approved 20.4 percent of the time last month. Thats up from 20.1 percent in July. Data comes from the August 2014 Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index. The rate in August was the highest since the Great Recession and is a sign that bigger banks are becoming more willing to invest in small businesses. In fact, over the course of the last year, that approval rate has increased 15 percent, the research shows. In a release further detailing the results of the latest report, Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora : Biz2Credit analyzes 1,000 small business loan applications filed each month at Biz2Credit.com to determine this rate. The research labels a big bank as one that has more than $10 billion in assets. Conversely, that data also shows that small businesses were less successful in August than they had the previous month when applying for loans at small banks. The rate of approvals for small businesses from those institutions dropped to 50.6 percent in August from 50.9 in July. Institutional lenders continue to give loans to small businesses at a steady rate. Last month, the approval rate was 59.4 percent, up slightly from 59.3 in July. Arora says that institutional lenders  like insurance companies and credit funds  can offer a longer-term product (in this case, a loan) at a reasonable price. He says: Biz2Credits data supports that statement, showing the approval rates for small business loans from alternative lenders like cash advance companies dropped to 62.7 percent last month. Thats the seventh consecutive month that rate has dropped, according to the report.","eBay is telling its users to reset their passwords after discovering a cyber attack that compromised encrypted non-financial files. The company insisted in a post on its official Website today that the reset was only a best practices precaution. The company says there is no evidence credit card or other financial data belonging to eBays customers or sellers was accessed. However, the company did admit the database compromised sometime between late February and early March did include customer names, encrypted passwords, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and date of birth information. In a statement addressing privacy concerns as part of the official announcement, the company : In the announcement the company also said it was working with law enforcement and security experts to investigate the breach. But the company said to date there is no evidence the attack led to any unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the site that might affect users. The company also said there is no evidence that PayPal, which eBay also owns, was affected by the attack. PayPal data is stored in a separate database and all files are encrypted. eBay said it would be informing users through email, site communications and other marketing channels of the recommendation to change their passwords. The company said it would also recommend customers who use the same passwords on other sites to change those as well. Cyber attackers apparently gained access to eBays system by compromising a small number of employee log-in credentials. Founded in San Jose, Calif. in 1995, eBay estimates it enabled $205 billion in commerce between buyers and sellers in 2013.","If youre a parent with a misbehaving kid, youve likely had to come up with different forms of discipline. Now, parents in the Atlanta area have a new option, thanks to a local barber. Russell Fredrick of A-1 Kutz in the Atlanta suburb of Snellville came up with a creative solution for parents who have reached their wits end  the Benjamin Button Special. (The special is named for the 2008 film and the F.Scott Fitzgerald story upon which it is based, about a man who ages in reverse.) Three days a week, parents can bring their misbehaving kids into the barbershop for a special haircut, free of charge. The haircut involves shaving off the hair at the top of the childs head so he resembles a balding senior citizen. Its a creative and ironic punishment for those kids who want to act grown as Fredrick put it on Instagram. Fredrick first used the haircut as a form of discipline for his own child, whose grades had fallen. But after the haircut, Fredrick the Washington Post that the 12-year-olds grades dramatically skyrocketed. He evidently wanted to avoid another Benjamin Button special. After achieving these results, Fredrick decided to offer it to his barbershop guests. He a photo of his next Benjamin Button special on Instagram with the following caption: Fredrick tells The Post that the reaction to the special has been mostly positive. But some have criticized the disciplinary measure as being emotionally abusive. Still, Fredrick, a father of three, said hes noticed a lot of parents just need a creative way to deal with misbehaving kids. And he thinks his hair-cutting solution should be used as a last resort. He explains: In addition, the special has brought a lot of attention to A-1 Kutz. And the local parents who have benefited from this unique form of discipline could be more likely to send actual business to the barbershop as well.","If youre wondering how to turn your website into an app for Android and iPhone devices, youre not alone. Yes, customers have gone mobile and any small business without an on-the-go presence is missing out on business opportunities. Not convinced?

Responsive design makes your website look and operate better (think user-friendly) on mobile devices. A on the other hand, is a software application that you download from either Google Play (Android devices) or the App Store (iOS devices). Apps are fully functioning entities that exist separately from, but can be integrated with, your website. So, why create a mobile app if your website is already responsive?

Ah yes, WordPress updates. Thanks to its incredibly active developer and user communities, WordPress is constantly undergoing change. In addition to updates that fix bugs, users consistently suggest, cajole and demand new features and functionality that some part of the vast developer pool is going to agree with, create and add to the ever-powerful WordPress code base. Yes, there are a lot of moving parts in there. However, when WordPress release an update, it all goes out in one neat package for users to install (a process well be covering in a post next week). Then you get to . A WordPress website can have tons of plugins and each one needs to be updated when a new version is released. Thats right, needs to be because plugin updates do more than fix bugs and add features and functionality  they also address security vulnerabilities. And compromising your customer and business data is no joke. Happily, updating a WordPress plugin manually is a fairly straightforward process (well showyou how to do it below). However, the need to regularly check for updates and then update each one when an update available is tedious and time-consuming and that brings us around to the opening paragraphs cry of frustration, How do I automatically update WordPress Plugins?! The good news? Were going to answer that question below. First however, lets take a quick look at how to manually update a WordPress plugin. One of the many handy features of WordPress is the way it lets you know when there are updates available. As you can see below, the orangecircle next to the Updates menu item shows that there are updates available (the number displayed indicates how many updates are available) and the red circle next to the Plugin menu item shows that some of the updates (indicated by the number displayed) are plugins. Once you see the updates notifications, click on the Updates menu item to be taken to the updates screen shown below: Next, select the plugins you want to install by clicking in the box to the left of the plugins name (you can select all of them at once by clicking on the Select All box at the top or bottom of the plugins list). Once youve selected the plugins you want to update, click the, Update Plugins button and youll be taken to the install screen. Once the plugins have been updated, youll see a screen similar to this one: Thats it. Youre all done with this round! Now you just have to do it again and again and  To avoid that repetitive stuff, its time to answer the big question, How do I automatically update WordPress Plugins? Before we dive in, a quick heads-up: WordPress comes in two flavors: hosted and self-hosted. When you create your WordPress site over at wordpress.com, youre using the hosted option. While not as customizable as the self-hosted option, its the perfect platform if you want to get up and running quickly. Unfortunately, your choice of plugins is much more limited. On the plus side however, your website automatically updated and that includes your plugins. If you create your WordPress website over at one of the many available hosting companies, youre using the self-hosted option. Infinitely customizable, self-hosted WordPress sites can use any of the 36,375 plugins available over at wordpress.org and thats a good thing. Whats not so handy is that you need to update your plugins manually or set them up to update automatically. So if your site is self-hosted, this next section is for you. Ironically enough, the best way to automatically update your WordPress plugins is to use a plugin to do so. Heres a list of a few options: The plugin is our top choice for automating your plugin updates. As you can see below, it offers a clean interface andlots of options for managing your sites updates. The plugin adds some options to your sites General Settings page, letting you specify how auto-updates should work. Although the plugin hasnt been updated itself in twoyears, it still gets rave reviews. Created by the same folks as the Update Control plugin, this one goes to 11 with lots of bells and whistles. To sum up, if your WordPress site is hosted over at wordpress.com, you dont have to worry about any of this stuff. WordPress will handle the automatic updates for you. Of course, youre missing out on all the customization possible with a self-hosted WordPress site.

Youll need to deal with plugin updates yourself, either manually or automatically.","   IANS | 22 Sep, 2016  As the global financial markets waited nervously, the US Federal Reserve kept its key interest rates unchanged -- a move that should bring some cheer when Indian markets open on Thursday. ""The committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives,"" said a statement by the Federal Open Market Committee after a much-watched, two-day meeting. The committee said even though unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, the job gains have been solid, even as household spending has been growing strongly. But business investment has remained soft, while inflation has continued to run below the 2 per cent long-term target. ""Against this backdrop, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0.25 per cent to 0.50 per cent."" The meeting of the US central bank's key committee came well past the closing bell at Indian bourses. But it had a major bearing on investors sentiments. ","We talk a lot about taking the time to manage customer reviews and it makes sense to do so.  Online reviews grow legs: The search engines are aggregating them, Googles putting them on Google Place pages and many users are even starting searches on review sites.  You want to make sure that youre encouraging your customers to leave reviews, that you know whats being said about you and that youre active about managing them.  That said, not all reviews are created equal. And not every bad review warrants a response or even an acknowledgment.   How do you know the difference? Heres a quick list of the types of negative reviews worth responding to. And then some that arent. :  Ideally, youd like to be able to identify and make amends with angry customers before they leave your store/office, however, that doesnt always happen.  If someone leaves a review with a legitimate gripe or complaint, you should absolutely take steps to respond and try to correct the situation.  Apologize for the misstep, explain why it wont happen again and then offer an incentive to get them to give you a second go.  Youll not only mend the fence with that particular customer, but youll get the added benefit of allowing future customers to see how you address situations and how confident you are in your product. : If someone is on your business page leaving a nasty review about a doctor that doesnt work in your clinic or about an offer they didnt receive because it never actually existed, you should politely step in to correct them.  They probably dont realize theyve made an error and correcting the bad information will help to add context to new visitors who stumble across the page. :  There are Bad Reviews and then there are Bad Reviews With Legs because they were left by people with a large social network.  If a person with considerable social wealth says something bad about you and it begins to gain traction, you need to step in and do what you can to remedy the situation fast. Even if you think the complaint is petty or you wouldnt respond to it if it was left by an average person.  Minor issues become reputation disasters when theyre poked by the right person. Learn to identify them. : Whether you goofed or the customer made an error, if you think that you can salvage the bad experience or convince the customer to give you another shot, you should respond and make a good attempt to right the perceived wrong.  It probably wont take too much of your time and effort to reach out to that person and the benefit it could have will be considerable.  Youll not only win back that customer but you show everyone else who stumbles across that review that you care about your customers.  Remember, reviews are no longer tied to the sites they came from. :  Some users are known for leaving irate reviews about every establishment they visit.  If you go through someones profile and see that bad reviews are ALL thats there, dont waste your time trying to change that persons opinion.   You may step in if theyre providing completely nonfactual information about what you offer/charge/etc, however, this isnt a fight youre going to win.  Invest your time in something you can. Or go encourage someone to leave a positive review to help balance this one out. :  My mom always told me not to engage crazy people and theres no place this statement is truer than on the Internet. If you have a feeling that calmly addressing an angry review may give them more fire to throw at you or a reason to keep the nastiness going, it may be best just to let the review sit.  Hopefully there are lots of other positive reviews that will balance it out. : If you just read something about your business that has your hands absolutely shaking in anger and you just HAVE to correct that angry know-it-all dont. Either let another member of your staff handle it or let the review sit altogether.  Its far better to have one negative review on your profile than to have a permanent reminder of that one time you went off the handle.  Have you read about the SMB owner who was booked for battery and had to undergo a mental health evaluation? Yeah. . The best way to combat negative reviews is to be proactive about encouraging users to leave reviews in the first place. The only way a bad review can really hurt you is if its the only review on the page.  The same way you work to , you should be working to encourage users to leave reviews.  Sometimes the best offense is a great defense.","Facebook recently unveiled a highly anticipated new feature, , which is similar to a traditional search engine but is intended to provide users with direct answers to specific queries rather than a list of links that include some matching keywords. Graph Search is currently focused on helping users find information about people, photos, places and interests that can be found on Facebook. This update isnt specifically related to businesses, but users could use Graph Search to look for local businesses on Facebook. For example, a user could search Italian restaurants in Manhattan my friends like and view a list of relevant businesses that fit that criteria. Users also have the ability to filter search results on the right side of the page. So if a search is place related, a map showing search result locations will appear, as shown in the photo above, and users will have the ability to change the region or business category as they choose. The photo also shows what the search page looks like, including a photo, friends that have liked or been to the locations listed, and some general business information. Search results are limited to things users can already see on Facebook, such as things that friends have Liked publicly. But any business that has a Facebook presence can appear in relevant search results since that is something that can be seen by any Facebook user. Facebooks Sponsored Result advertising product will also be present in Graph Search, but as of now no new advertising options have been introduced to go along with this new feature. Another way this feature could potentially impact businesses on Facebook is through new targeting information. When users search items using Graph Search, that gives Facebook even more insights into their interests and preferences, and so businesses that advertise on the site could potentially benefit from that knowledge down the line if Facebook does decide to use that information to influence advertising options. When users submit a query that doesnt fit into the categories Facebook has indexed, users will see a search results page powered by Bing. Its not likely that many will use Graph Search as a typical search engine like this, since that isnt its intention, but the feature simply allows for broader use of the tool. Graph Search is currently being rolled out in limited beta and will likely continue to be updated with new features and information.","Making it easy for your customer to buy from you is a mantra most online retailers know well.

He was there to talk to business owners about the opportunities that lie in the area of mobile applications. He let us know that 52 percent of the phones he sold last week were smartphones  Web-enabled phones that customers are using to access information on the go.   And that number is only going to grow, especially as Google continues to become further and further entrenched in the space. When it comes to mobile applications, not all apps are created equal.  But for every and , theres a business-focused application that can help you engage, build your brand and even help you make smarter business decisions.  Below youll find a handful of mobile apps that provide big SMB benefits. If you have an iPhone or Android device, youre probably already using this application. If you havent heard of it, Bump allows users to bumptheir phones together to share contact information, photos, calendar information, or connect on social networks. Though it may sound silly, its actually quite helpful at networking events, when discussing potential partnerships or any other time youre meeting a new business contact. As an added bonus, it also drives BlackBerry users crazy when you bump in front of them. The same social media sites you use via your desktop can also help you connect with customers via the mobile Web.   Whether its responding to a tweet while on the go, uploading a photo of your business to Facebook or creating a new status update on LinkedIn, these social apps allow you to keep customers and colleagues up to date on your business even when youre not sitting at your computer. I also feel they help in taking that social relationship to the next level. Theres something very personal about the business owner who takes a photo of a pie that just came out of the oven and immediately uploads it to Twitter or Facebook.   You reach people in the moment and drive them into your store.  Because were all using our phones, it seems more intimate and more connected. If youre using a WordPress blog then you may also want to pick up the WordPress mobile application that will let you post, edit and approve comments to allow you to manage your blog on the go. You can also configure WordPress to cross-promote your posts to Twitter and Facebook to help share them with those audiences while youre out and about.  I often rely on this application to approve blog comments when traveling or stuck in line at the post office. Its a lot easier to whip out your BlackBerry while seated on the train than your laptop. Evernote is a mobile productivity application that pretty much amazes you the first time you use it.  How it works is that you either take a photo of something, record a snippet of audio (maybe a blog post idea or a receipt amount), enter text, etc., and Evernote will then save what you enter and make it searchable.  That means if youre in a meeting and someone throws up an impressive slide, you can take a photo and have it be searchable later. Or, if youre out researching new computers, you can take a photo of the spec sheet and then bring it up later by searching. Because Evernote can actually read the text and record it, it makes whatever you scanned/entered completely searchable. Its pretty cool. The of this application offers bigger upload capacity and other advanced features at just $5 a month. As the name suggests, this is a shopping application. With it, SMB owners can use their phones camera to scan barcodes and find the best prices online and in-store for the item theyre looking at.  It may sound like this is one of those frivolous, sheep-throwing type applications, but it can really save your small business quite a bit of money.  Use it when you buy office supplies, new electronics, educational books or magazines, or anything else you may purchase for your business. Or, if , either upload your items to Google Base (which you should be doing anyway) or provide ShopSavvy with your API  and you can include your items in their database. Its a great way to expose your business to targeted customers in your area. After all, if customers dont know about your items, they cant buy them.  Make sure you get your products listed with ShopSavvy to help them find you. If youre currently sporting the iPhone, then Shoeboxed has a great application to help you track expenses.  Just take a photo of your receipt and the application will extract the data and post it to your account. From there you can create expense reports, track receipts and more. Perhaps the only flaw with this application is that, to date, its only available for the iPhone.  Id love to see one for the BlackBerry. If youre using an Android device, then is a pretty good alternative.  Im still trying to find one I like for the BlackBerry. With Docs To Go, SMBs can create, view and edit Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files directly from their mobile devices.  If you often find yourself working on the go or trying to access files, this is a handy app to have around.  As I mentioned earlier, its often a lot easier to grab your mobile device than your laptop. is another great application for creating docs or spreadsheets on the go, if you prefer that suite. Those are some of my favorite mobile apps, but as an SMB owner you should be working with any application that ranks well and is relevant to your business or can help you work smarter.  Which mobile apps are you currently using?","Think back to when you started your most recent company. What were the biggest mistakes you made at the time? Or, if youre in the process of starting a business today, what mistake are you most concerned about making? has come up with this infographic listing 15 startup mistakes small business owners and entrepreneurs need to consider. They run the gamut from underestimating the financial requirements of your startup to spending too much time on product development  and not enough on sales. But of all the startup mistakes, perhaps the most critical involve your business plan, your hiring process and the building of your core team. One of the can be that its either too big or too small to be much use, says veteran entrepreneur, small business coach and social media strategist Melinda Emerson. In the first example, Emerson says, unless you are seeking money from investors, your business plan seldom needs to be the 40 plus document youve probably read about in business books or maybe heard about in business school. Such a plan would probably be too complicated to be useful anyway. In the other extreme, entrepreneurs might have been too busy in the startup phases of their business or too intimidated by the whole business plan writing process to ever bother. In this case, Emerson says, its never too late to get started. Another problem is that some entrepreneurs never look at their business plan after creating it. In some cases, this may be because it is not very actionable  filled with fluff and $10 words but without clear steps abouthow to proceed. When it comes to hiring, some of the biggest mistakes have to do with not thinking about how potential employees will fit into your plan and your vision, says Small Business Trends founder and CEO Anita Campbell. may include hiring for aptitude only rather than for attitude. Aptitude important. But its only the first step to identify viable candidates. Its after this that entrepreneurs and small business owners should use the interview process to figure out whether a candidate has the proper attitude to make him or her the right fit for your company. Another mistake is failing to write a detailed description of the position you are trying to fill. Without a proper description you run the risk of hiring someone who is not a good fit for the role you had envisions. In the end, the person is likely to leave or be let go, leaving other employees overburdened and the work your new employee was supposed to address undone. Team building is an important part of the startup process. Building the proper team can help you accomplish tasks more efficiently and draw on the creativity and energy of others to help you accomplish your goals. But ignoring the well-being and the needs of your team can lead you to , warns entrepreneur Valentine Belonwu. These mistakes can include things like failing to communicate clear cut goals with your team thus making it more difficult for you and them to succeed. But it can also include failure to show faith in your team members by insisting on doing everything yourself instead of letting others contribute to the process. For important startup errors to avoid, see the full infographic below.

It looks like Yahoo is doing this primarily to make room for potential new users of its services coming over from Tumblr.As , Yahoo announced plans to acquire the popular social blogging network for $1.1 billion last month. The company said on its official Tumblr blog Wednesday that it will allow new users to stake their claims on inactive Yahoo IDs. Heres what Yahoo Senior Vice President of Platforms about the changes in a post called  Can Be Yours!: Heres how Yahoo plans to give new users a crack at the old inactive IDs. In mid-July, Rossiter said Yahoo will be resetting IDs inactive for 12 months or longer.At that time, Rossiter says anyone will have a chance to score one of these free IDs. No word yet on exactly how this will work. They can then return to Yahoo in mid August to find out whether they got the ID of their choice.Yahoo IDs are used to access most Yahoo services including Yahoo Mail and Flickr photostreams.

Have you ever wondered if you should form an LLC for your business or where you should incorporate? Or maybe youre not sure if you need to create a non-profit for your activities? These are just a few of the frequently asked questions about incorporation. Assembled below are all the answers to the most frequently asked questions when it comes to incorporating your business. If youre a small business owner, read on to learn more about the various business structures and how you should incorporate your business. The main reason to incorporate (or form an LLC) is to minimize your personal liability. Once your business is incorporated (either by forming an LLC or Corporation), it exists as a separate business entity. Essentially, you put a wall separating your personal assets from anything in the business. Of course, there are other benefits too. Here are the top reasons to incorporate: 1. Minimize your personal liability and protect your personal assets. 2. Get more flexibility when it comes to taxes (talk to your CPA or tax advisor for specific advice on your personal situation). 3. Boost the credibility of your small business. 4. Add a layer of privacy (dont use your personal name and home address to represent your business). 5. Start building your business credit. 6. Protect your business name and brand at the state level. The only real drawback of incorporating is that youll need to operate your business at a higher administrative level than youre used to as a sole proprietorship. In addition, incorporating as a C Corporation can result in higher taxes for some small business scenarios due to double taxation. With a C Corporation, the business needs to pay taxes on any profits, and then owners are also taxed when any profits are distributed to them. Obviously, if youre looking to put your small business profits into your own pocket, you may end up paying a lot in taxes. However, as the following question shows, there are ways to avoid double taxation while still getting some of the benefits of incorporation. As mentioned above, the C Corporations tax structure isnt optimal for many small businesses, since business owners often are taxed twice on the profits. However, Corporations can elect for S Corporation tax treatment. Often called a pass-through entity, an S Corporation doesnt file its own taxes. Rather, profits and losses of the business are passed through and reported on the business owners personal tax return. To qualify for S Corporation tax treatment, youll need to fill out with the IRS. Youll need to do this no more than 75 days from the date of incorporation, or no more than 75 days from the start of the current tax year. Be aware that not every business can qualify to be an S Corporation. For example, an S Corporation cannot have more than 100 shareholders and shareholders must be U.S. citizens or residents. An LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a hybrid of a sole proprietorship/partnership and corporation. This structure is very popular among small businesses, and for good reason. The LLC limits the personal liability of the owners, but doesnt require much of the heavy formality and paperwork of the corporation. This makes it a great choice for business owners that want liability protection but dont want to deal with exhaustive meeting minutes, addendum filings or other paperwork youd need to file as a corporation. You can structure your LLC to be taxed as an S Corporation (as described above) where company profits flow through to the owners and are taxed at the personal income rate. A nonprofit is created for charitable, educational or other purposes (actually there are five recognized purposes: charitable, religious, scientific, educational and literary). Nonprofits cannot benefit the owners: all money above operating costs must be used to further the goals of the nonprofit. This allows nonprofits to operate tax-free. Approval is needed at both at the State and Federal (IRS) level. Just like with other corporations or LLCs, a nonprofit corporation offers a corporate shield that helps protect the personal assets of the nonprofits stakeholders. In most cases, as long as the legal structure remains correct, stakeholders of nonprofit corporations are immune from individual liability. You often hear of companies . Thats because Delaware offers flexible, pro-business statutes, while Wyoming and Nevada feature low filing fees as well as no state corporate income, franchise or personal income taxes. However, as a general rule of thumb, if your business will have fewer than five shareholders, you should incorporate in the state where you actually live or where your business has a physical presence (such as an office.) When you incorporate in a different state from your physical presence, youll need to deal with added fees and paperwork, since youre considered operating out of state. And for most small businesses, the added hassle and fees just arent worth it. In most cases, its best to incorporate or form an LLC as soon as possible. After all, the main benefit is liability protection and by waiting to incorporate, you can be exposing yourself to liability. Keep in mind that your corporations start date is not retroactive. This typically means filing two business income tax returns for the year. For example, if your corporation was formed on June 1, youll need to file as a sole proprietor (or whatever your previous entity may have been) from Jan. 1  May 31 and then file as a corporation from June 1  Dec. 31. There are three common methods for incorporating or forming an LLC. Each has its pros and cons, depending on your needs: , you may want to speak with a tax professional to determine what business structure will be the best for your particular circumstances.","I love Monty Pythons and Im sure that I speak for all of us when I say NO SPAM PLEASE  especially the email kind!  Yet, email continues to be the primary way that we communicate with each other and with our customers because its cost effective and efficient. I currently have several clients that are considering using email marketing as a strategy and this is what prompted my curiosity in the new book   by Eric Groves.    It must have been fate because while I was making plans to purchase the book, Constant Contact sent me a copy for review. You may already have heard of Constant Contact.  They are one of the most popular providers of email marketing services.  Hundreds of thousands of businesses rely on Constant Contact for technology, support and education to promote their products and services via email.  Ive referred them to clients for years because they offer just the right balance between cost, ease of use and having a great reputation for getting your email through to your intended recipient.  In other words, no one is better qualified to put together a book on how to successfully manage your email marketing campaign. I read and review a lot of books and cant recall the last time Ive actually read a book that was put out by an organization and written by one of its employees, Eric Groves, Senior Vice President, Global Market Development.  I think its a brilliant branding move.  This book further cements Constant Contact as a credible and experienced resource. The book I received is a hard-back.  This is a good thing because youre going to want a sturdy copy since its going to get a lot of use as you implement your marketing campaign.  Here is the bulleted list from the inside cover of what is inside: This is a book youll want to pick up and read all the way through first.  Eric Groves writing style is easy and direct.  Its almost as if the book is a friendly how-to manual peppered with insider advice that youll want to listen to because it was gained through years of learning experiences. The first four chapters are introductory in nature: Then chapter 5 starts the how-to portion of the book.  The rest of the 14 chapters are ones that you can reference depending on where you are trying to improve.  Here are just a few chapters that grabbed my attention: The underlying message I got out of the book is that YOU are ultimately responsible for the success of your email marketing; not your email marketing service provider.  In reading the book, I got this impression that Constant Contact decided to write this book after watching so many businesses hurt themselves and their marketing efforts by doing it wrong. My recommendation for everyone is to get this book and literally follow it page by page as you implement your email marketing campaign.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  If you think your process is better, challenge it by following Constant Contacts process and see if your stats improve. This is the perfect time to pick up .  Start fresh and start strong with a campaign that shows you in the best light for your customers and prospects.","  When the cabinet of PM Modi was shuffled a few days back, the biggest news came in the form of Smriti Irani being replaced by Prakash Javadekar. As soon as the news was announced, people began to speculate the reasons behind this change, one of which was the non-delivery or slow movement on the PMO's to-do list for higher education.  However, turns out, other than that, she also failed to deliver on the school education to-do list, which was also being closely monitored by the PMO.  As against the five key issues that were undelivered on the higher education side, including the autonomy of IIMs and world-class institutes, school education had a 39 point to-do list, including a focus on improving learning levels, teacher training and vocationalisation.  PM himself reviewed the implementation of actions taken on these issues in a meeting held on March 10.  Even though the ministry was talking about addressing these aspects for over a year now, something concrete was yet to be done. However, some of the steps were taken within the stipulated timelines; however, a majority of steps were yet to be taken, which probably led to Irani's exit from the ministry.

This is an attempt to return the land as a bio-diverse rainforest for elephants, tigers, leopards, deer, snakes, birds and hundreds of other creatures. The couple owns 300 acres of land in Brahmagiri, a mountain range in the Western Ghats, which houses the Malhotras Save Animals Initiative (SAI) Sanctuary. Its probably the only private wildlife sanctuary in the country with more than 300 kinds of birds as well as many rare and threatened animal species. In a report by , things were quite different 1991 when Anil, 75, and Pamela, 64, who run the SAI Sanctuary Trust, came to this part of the country. When I came here with a friend who suggested I buy this land, it was a wasteland of 55 acres. The owner wanted to sell because he couldnt grow coffee or anything else here, said Anil, an alumnus of Doon School, who worked in the real estate and restaurant business in the US before moving to India. For me and Pamela, this was what we were looking for all our life, he added. They sold their property in Hawaii, bought the first 55 acres at the foothills of the Brahmagiri range and began afforestation work. There were legal complications as many land documents were not in order and many farmers had debts to be settled. ""Once we bought the land, we allowed the forest to regenerate. We planted native species where necessary and allowed nature to take care of the rest,"" said Anil. Today, SAI Sanctuary covers approximately 300 acres, and draws naturalists and scientists doing research on the different animal species as well as hundreds of indigenous trees and plants, which have medicinal value as well.","Big news: Google has announced a new AdWords Upgraded URLs format to give advertisers more features/options and save them time. Google Upgraded URLs will mean less time spent managing URL tracking updates, reduced crawl and load times, new tracking parameters and, finally, an end to the sending back of ads for editorial review when tracking criteria are changed (in most cases). This will be a forced migration, but advertisers shouldnt get too upset about it. It really was stupid that advertisers lost all of their tracking history and Quality Scores if they had to change their tracking parameters. In fact, we have clients who were terrified of messing around with the tracking on top-performing ads for fear of messing this up! So yes, its a welcome change  and long overdue. But whats changed and what do you need to know about Google Upgraded URLs? Lets jump in and see. A Destination URL is simply the address of your webpage people reach when they click one of your ads. The way its worked until now is that AdWords ad and keyword tracking relied on the Destination URL, which was made up of the landing page URL and tracking parameters. If you wanted to adjust your tracking for any reason, you had to update the Destination URL, which sent your ads back to editorial review. Your ads would stop running during this review and whatever information was tied to the old URL was lost. This upgrade basically splits the Destination URL into two parts  you can now enter the landing page portion of the URL and the tracking information separately. Its so much easier and more convenient! Changing your tracking parameters at any level except the ad level doesnt trigger a review, your ads dont have to stop running, and you can update your tracking at the account, campaign or ad group level without seeing your ad stats go down the drain. This is what youre used to seeing: The landing page field was where you could choose to set a Destination URL  but that option is retiring and youll no longer see it there. Final URL will be the only landing page option youll see. Final URLs will need to match the domain of your display URL or your ad may be disapproved. According to Google, your final URL can still contain redirects within that domain. Now, youll use URL options to manage your tracking and redirect information. With this change, youll be able to specify URL options at the account, campaign, ad group, ad, keyword, auto target, and sitelink level. You can optionally use a to bring together your tracking and landing page information if youre specifying additional tracking parameters or redirects. The tracking template creates a new address people will click through to go to your site. ValueTrack appends tracking values to your ads landing page URLs and records certain details about the ad, which you can then review in Google Analytics or third-party analytics software. It helps advertisers better understand where ads get the most traffic, and which ads or keywords get the most clicks. Now, ValueTrack itself is not new, but much has been added with this URL upgrade, including a location-tracking parameter: See the full list of ValueTrack parameters from . One more small-ish change as part of this upgrade: The {copy} parameter is being deprecated and will not be supported by Upgraded URLs. If you were using it, you can either create a new tracking template and custom parameter, or just a custom parameter. Learn more about those two options . Because the old system was clunky and not advertiser-friendly at all. Okay, thats not how they put it, but thats the truth. The official word was,  we are introducing Upgraded URLs to provide an easier and faster way to manage and track important information about each click on your AdWords ads*. (The asterisk refers to a note at the bottom of Googles blog post with this news, which says, Everywhere we say ads, we also mean other targeting options available for the Search Network, Display Network, and Shopping.) Right now, Google is rolling out the change to all advertisers, so youll be able to try it out soon if you cant already. The forced migration is coming later this year, beginning in July 2015. At that point or shortly after, all of your Destination URLs will automatically become Final URLs. You can start manually migrating your Destination URLs now. However, if you start manually upgrading at the ad level today, its like creating new ads; your performance stats will be reset and your ads will be sent back for review. Repeat: Dont start the upgrade today at the ad level unless youre ready to lose your stats! Google has released a in anticipation of this switch, to help you identify what type of advertiser you are (theyve segmented advertisers into groups by activities and type of tracking), and which upgrade method you should use. There is a palpable fear among advertisers of changing things in AdWords, particularly things that are doing well. We tend to have a If its not broken, dont fix it mentality. However, since Google would reset the ad history and you lost your Quality Scores and everything else under the old system, we can safely say it was broken and this a great fix. It makes sense for Google to not discourage in any way advertisers tracking of the ROI of their campaigns, so elimination of this dumb thing makes a lot of sense. Get to know it, get comfortable with it, and get ready for it!","Last week, Google announced  a new way of organizing and displaying information for local businesses and attractions.  Google used to show local business information via info bubbles associated with Google Maps.  Now, however, Google has taken the extra step and broken out business information into full-fledged profile pages. The pages are filled with a mix of provided and aggregated content. Place Pages are actually quite similar to the Google Profiles that Google recently started encouraging individuals to create. Only this time, it is Google creating the profile pages for businesses, points of interest, cities, neighborhoods and even transit stops. And not everyone is happy about it. From a user perspective, the Place pages are pretty worthwhile. Theyre attractive, informative, easy to use, and encourage small business owners to claim their listing and make it as accurate as possible.  From one page, a user can get a store address, directions to the storefront, find out whats nearby, read reviews, see images, get a map to the location, etc.  In essence, any piece of information someone may need about your business is accessible from that page. If youre a searcher, that means far less clicking around for you and a higher chance of finding trustworthy information. Very cool. Of course, if you happen to be that small business site, you probably dont want customers interacting with your Google Place Page. You want them on your Web site  a place that you control and have total authority over.  And thats where the controversy comes in. When Google initially launched its Pages, they assured business owners and SEOs that though each profile page would have a unique, structured URL, they would not be indexed (ie they would not rank and therefore compete with your site). We were told that the Place pages would only be found within the Maps silo. However, a search for [ ] clearly shows an indexed Google Place page for the Boston caf.  Over at Search Engine Land, Danny Sullivan notes in the postscript that he thinks the in how to prevent these pages from showing up and used the wrong tag. As a result, the listing appears because it received links to the page causing Google to index it. Danny bets that Google will soon be changing this. Of course, others are suggesting that Google is set to create business landing pages that theyll be able to use to hoard searchers and place ads on.  Theres also the danger that if your Google Place Page has more info than your real Web site, that people will link their instead  taking links, rankings and traffic away from your real site. Personally, Im not too worried about the Google Place Pages, even if they do start ranking for local businesses (though I dont like the competitor PPC ads). And as a small business owner, I dont think you should be either.  These pages are helping users find you. You may lose some traffic to your site, but in most cases, theyre simply helping someone find information about your business. What you should be focused on is making sure that the information on your page is as accurate as you can make it and to monitor the page should questionable content arise.   Until we know what Google is going to do with Google Place Pages, theres not much more we can do. Whats your take on Google Place Pages?","Yelp is probably here to stay. Though the company , or $0.08 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2012, thats less than the net loss of $9.1 million, or $0.56 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2011. At the same time, revenue for the quarter was $41.2 million, up 65 percent from earnings in 2011. Meanwhile, Yelp managed to reach a significant milestone last month. The hitting 100 million unique visitors in January for the first time since the sites inception. What does this mean for your business? If you have a Yelp page, youre more likely to receive customer feedback than ever before. And if you havent visited Yelp, it may be time to discover whether a page has already been created for your business and what people are saying about you there. For those not familiar with the site, Yelp provides the opportunity to gain customer feedback and to market your company, especially a local business, to local consumers or other businesses interested in working with you. To get an idea of how the site works and how to get up and running using it, check out from TJ McCue. Not everyone is sold on the sites importance as a location-based marketing tool, however. First of all, there are plenty of competitors in the space. Some reports point to the possibility that Facebooks Graph Search could replace other location-based rivals with . Adam Gottlieb advises against business owners buying into the location-based marketing hype. Reasons to avoid investing too heavily include steep cost, high learning curve, no guarantee of return, and a highly specialized group of customers. On the other hand, Gottlieb agrees, its important to keep up with what your customers are saying about you. In fact, one study suggests that customer reviews on sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Angies List might be more important than professional reviews to many customers. The study by Weber Shandwick and KRC Research shows how customer reviews trump professional opinions of consumer products like smartphones, PCs, and printers, and how consumers find them. The study also shows how interested customers are in the .","EXCLUSIVE : Our friends at Six Apart are about to get another big round of venture funding. It is their series B round of funding, and the lead investor in this round is said to be August Capital. Augusts capital wont be much of a surprise for the two entities have old linkages. For instance, former August Capital partner Andrew Anker is now an Executive Vice President of Corporate Development. The amount of money raised is still under a shroud, though I am told it could be well over $5 million, a modest investment when compared to Silicon Valleys free spending ways of the past. ( Press release says $10 million ) Many of my better sources in Silicon Valley say that there was a good chance of Sequoia Capital participating in the round, but obviously that did not pan out. I have sources telling me David Hornik of August Capital spearheading the investment, and is likely to join the board of the company. The Trotts obviously are not talking, and neither is rest of the senior management. I had tried getting in touch with Hornik but he would not say. Anyway I am pretty certain of the news. Six Apart had received an undisclosed amount of money from Joi Itos VC fund, Neoteny . Reid Hoffman, a member of the founding team and former executive officer of PayPal is also an investor. The company has been on a tear and recently signed a deal with Nokia where Nokia camera phones (ugly as they might be) play nice with TypePad, SixAparts hosted service.","When 2020 hits, you can bet it will start the decade of driverless cars. Volvo We rounded up 19 companiesaiming to havedriverless car technology ready by 2020, someeven declaring their fully autonomous car will be hitting the roads at that time. (Assuming the various necessary regulations are in place, of course.) Here's who is in the race to make driverless cars a reality just four years from now.","Last year we published a list of . One of the more popular tools on that list is Hootsuite. Today we give you a deep dive into Hootsuite: what it is and how it can make you more productive with social media. If you are looking for a tool that lets you manage all of your social media accounts and presence in a single place, and collaborate as a team on them, then should be at the top of your list to investigate. Hootsuite is a Web-based tool (although it also can be used on popular mobile devices- see screenshot above). You take a few minutes to set up a Hootsuite account; then connect your various social media profiles. After this one-time setup, you will be able to use it. Here are 4 essential functions that Hootsuite performs: You do this from the Hootsuite dashboard, without visiting each site separately or using a multitude of different mobile apps. This includesreplying to others, retweeting, liking, sharing and responding to private messages, and otherwise carrying out activity on your social accounts. The activities that you can perform vary by social media platform. You wont be able to do every single thing for your Facebook Page, for instance. But weve found that we can do 90% of our day-to-day social activities from within Hootsuite. You can manage Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, LinkedIn, Google Plus, MySpace, WordPress and Mixi  individual profiles and business pages. The built-in calendar is one of the most important features. Use it to schedule posts to your social accounts. In other words, you can keep your accounts active. More importantly, you can be efficient by scheduling all your social updates at one time for, say scheduling once a day or once a week. In other words, you can batch your work. Then you arent constantly interrupting other activities to update social accounts throughout the day or week. Theres also an auto-schedule feature that will automatically schedule your tweets and updates to go out at optimal times. Running a marketing campaign and have a lot of updates to make over a period of say, two weeks? You can actually upload a CSV spreadsheet for all the messages. If you prefer set it and forget it automation, you can add RSS feeds to automatically update social accounts every time a new article goes out from your company blog, for example. You can set it to post one item at a time (recommended) or more. You can direct it to check for new items in the feed and post them, once per hour or up to once per day. You can assign tasks, such as responding to a tweet or a private direct message, to a team member, as seen above. No emails or separate instant message instructions needed. Assignments are right there within the Hootsuite dashboard. Also, because multiple users can use Hootsuite, everyone can see what activity is completed or hasnt been done yet. Again, no communicating via email or messaging programs to find out if someone followed up on that Twitter customer complaint yet, or not. How many users you can have depends on which product level and upgrades you have purchased. Fragmented results here and there dont do much to help you analyze and understand how well social media is working  or not. For that, you really need to see a birds eye view of activity over a period of time, and be able to compare it. Many social media platforms now offer analytics. But who has time to run and grab those analytics from Facebook Insights, or a multitude of other social sites? Hootsuites built-in analytics and reports give this kind ability to track your progress and understand whats working best, in one place. Best of all, you can get weekly reports emailed to you. These are extremely helpful. For instance, here at Small Business Trends we review the analytics reports in staff meetings from time to time. The company keeps investing in enhancements to its platform. Hootsuite just keeps getting better. And thats not always true with products. Here are two aspects that are particularly impressive: Youre not limited to managing just the 8 social media platforms Hootsuite currently covers. You can extend capabilities to other social media sites and even other programs, by adding apps from the Hootsuite Apps Directory. For instance, youll find apps for social sites such as Instagram, Tumblr, Flickr, Scoop.it, YouTube and several more(see screenshot below). Then there are apps that offer some level of integration or interoperability with popular marketing and CRM programs that businesses use. There are apps forConstantContact, Nimble, HubSpot, Salesforce, ZenDesk and more. What exactly the apps allow you to do with Hootsuite varies by app. For a description of one such app, see our write-up about the . Most apps are free. Some, like the app for Salesforce, require an additional monthly fee. But even the paid premium apps are relatively inexpensive. Apps usually cost less than $5 per month per premium app. I like the fact that Hoosuite has been open to allowing these kinds of apps, through its developer program. It makes Hootsuite more useful as a central dashboard and management tool. Another positive aspect of Hoosuite is that it offers different pricing and feature levels. Theres a free level, for a single user to update 5 social profiles. This is good for a really small startup or sole proprietor. Its also a risk-free way to try out Hootsuite. The Pro version, currently $8.99 a month  the price recently went up  can be used with a small team of two users. Additional users can be added for a fee. The added users can vary  anywhere from $10 to $15 for the third user, and $15 to $30 each additional after that. It all depends on whether you are under the new pricing or old. Note that some of the features in this review may only be available at the Pro level. With Pro you can manage an unlimited number of social profiles. You receive an enhanced analytics report, and can choose an unlimited number of apps. Theres a 30-day free trial of this version, too. The Pro version is what most small businesses likely will use. The Enterprise version is for, well, large enterprises. Pricing is not even available on the site for Enterprise. The Enterprise version adds advanced features, such as advanced security, geo-targeting, advanced customer support. It also adds Hootsuite University, an online training program for social media and learning to use Hootsuite. Theres a discount of 10% for annual billing instead of monthly, for some savings. While I like the different levels of Hootsuite, some small businesses may consider it expensive to purchase certain add-ons ala carte. The cost can really add up. Hootsuite University is one such add-on Ive heard people kvetch about. Ala carte its $21 per month. Small business teams really could benefit from training. But the pricing model poses a challenge. Smallbusiness owners Ive heard from are concerned that once you sign up for a monthly fee, if team members dont use it, you could find your organization a year later paying for a service thats rarely been used  just because somebody forgot to cancel it. A one-time fee per user would solve that issue. Another pricing issue is the limitations and expense of using vanity URL shorteners for brand enhancement of your links shared. For instance, at Small Business Trends weve started using our own URL shortener of http://SBT.me.  Hootsuite allows custom URLs  but only if you sign up for Owly Pro. That costs $49.99 per month. Small businesses will be very cost sensitive about social media tools.Just . Of those the majority isolate the dollar value to under $1,000 per year. Still, at the base price of under ten bucks a month, Hootsuite Pro delivers excellent value. The base price should be affordable by most small businesses. Just be careful about those add-ons! At Small Business Trends we are paying customers of Hootsuite. We did not get any special consideration for this review. As mentioned, Hootsuite is a Web-based based app, and can be used from most modern browsers. There are extensions (hootlets or hootbars) for Chrome and Firefox browsers. Hootsuite offers mobile apps so that you can manage your social presence from aniPhone, Android devices and the iPad. HootSuite Media, Inc. was founded in 2008 by Ryan Holmes, who is also the company CEO. Its headquarters is located in Vancouver, BC, Canada. It has over 6 million users, who send 3 million messages a day through the dashboard.","Hey video creators, would you like to set a new YouTube custom channel URL for your YouTube channel?

The company has also announced a new e-reader and an update to its classic Kindle e-reader. But the most important of these devices may stand out because of its very low price. The Kindle Fire has never been a tablet to break the bank but the company has introduced a new version of the Kindle Fire HD that starts at less than $100. To do this, Amazon is shrinking the tablet considerably leaving only a 6-inch display.A screen that size makes the device slightly larger than the average phablet and an inch smaller than Amazons standard Kindle Fire HD. The Kindle Fire HD6 has8MB of internal storage. But it is also sold with 16GB of internal storage for $119. For a slightly larger tablet experience, Amazon hasalso released a new . That device starts at $139, with 8GB of internal storage. The same tablet with 16GB of internal storage is $159. Of course, the device has a 7-inch display. Both the 6- and 7-inch Fire HD tablets will have a quad-core processor and a front- and rear-facing camera. Amazon says the 2-megapixel rear-facing camera can shoot video in 1080p HD. So that would allow users to participate in Skype and other online video chat platforms. Both tablets will also run on the new Amazon-molded version of Android, Fire OS 4 Sangria. And Amazon is offering the devices in five colors: black, white, magenta, citron, or cobalt. On the higher end of the new releases, the new has an 8.9-inch display. By comparison with other similar devices,Amazon says that the new Kindle Fire HDX is 20 percent lighter than the Apple iPad Air and will also run Fire OS4 Sangria. The company also says the new Kindle Fire HDX sports the fastest connectivity hardware available. Amazon says the tablet has the fastest WiFi connection available. And it also supports 4G LTE service for use on-the-go. The Kindle Fire HDX also has an HD front-facing camera and an 8-megapixel rear-mounted camera. Specs say the tablet has a battery that supports 12 hours of browsing the Web and streaming audio. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement on the introduction of the new devices: For business users, the new Amazon tablets are all pre-loaded with WPS Office, a Microsoft alternative software compatiple across multiple operating systems. Amazon says this allows users to create, edit, save, and share word document, spreadsheet, and presentation files. Amazon has also made major enhancements to its Kindle e-readers, and introduced a brand new device to boot. The new Kindle Voyage is unique in that it is connected to an always-on 3G network the company is including for free with purchase of the device. This allows users to always stay connected, downloading new products and sharing updates via social media on the books theyre reading. Kindle Voyage will also have a new feature called PagePress, which hides touch sensors beneath the bezel. Amazon says that a press on the sensor will turn pages of an e-book being read on the device. Kindle Voyage will retail at $199. Amazon says its the thinnest device the company has ever made at 7.6 millimeters. The company is also updating its Kindle e-reader including a first-time-ever touch-screen interface. The company says that the new Kindle e-reader has 4GB of internal storage, twice that of the previous generation of devices, and will sell for $79. Finally, Amazon is also offering two new Kindle Fire tablets that are specifically designed for children. One has a 6-inch display and other a 7-inch display like their grown-up counterparts.","Google Glass isnt officially available to the public yet. But some businesses are already considering the potential impact of allowing such devices to be used on site. And some are putting people on advance notice with Google Glass banned signs. The wearable computer, which just a few thousand explorers currently have access to, gives users hands-free access to a number of smartphone features. They include the ability to take photos and videos. Both these features are a big part of the reason why some business owners have already decided to ban the device in their establishments. Seattles 5 Point Caf claims to be one of the first businesses in that city to ban the device from its premises. The owner in a March 5 Facebook post: Comments to the post were mixed. Some patrons seemed happy with the businesss concern for their privacy, while many others criticized the move as a publicity stunt and accused the owner of hating technology. The owner has since admitted that part of his intention was to be funny and get a reaction from Facebook followers. But he is serious about the ban. And hes not the only one to openly discuss the issue. Other types of businesses, including movie theaters, casinos and strip clubs, have also considered banning the devices preemptively. Fast Company, which is tracking the banning of the devices, New Jersey gaming authorities have already given local casinos permission to ban the devices. The National Association of Theatre Owners is preparing to develop a policy for their use at cinemas. In fact, Search Engine Journal has a list of 10 places likely to ban the devices. They include businesses like banks and any business like a health club or gym that might include a locker room or changing area. One group, in particular, is pushing to raise awareness among business owners and the community. Places where people expect to socialize freely like bars, clubs or restaurants are likely to be impacted, said Jack Winters of the privacy advocacy site in a recent email interview. The website is part of an organization founded to draw attention to some of the privacy issues surrounding wearable tech like Google Glass. Winters said that places like schools or doctors offices where children may be present should consider some of the legal issues surrounding allowing cameras and recording devices and the distribution of the images they create. And Google Glass isnt necessarily just another recording device. Smartphones and other mobile devices already give many individuals the ability to take photos and record videos at a moments notice. But Google Glass users have the ability to do so without actually showing any signs of recording. Your smartphone probably lives in your pocket, in your bag or on a table. There is a clear change in role from ordinary person to photographer, audio recorder or camera man. This both discourages you from constantly capturing stuff and acts as a series of social cues announcing that you are about to start recording, Winters said. He added that while it is possible for people to take photos or videos using their phones without attracting much attention, it doesnt happen often. However with Google Glass, there are programs that can take a series of photos or record automatically without even requiring the user to press a button or use a voice command. In addition, the advanced technology used by Glass opens the door for other anti-privacy features like real-time facial recognition, although Google has announced that it will not allow applications that use such technology. Face recognition is potentially a huge problem with the power to end anonymity and enable stalking and stigmatization. However, we are pleased that Google is taking this issue seriously and have banned face recognition at the moment, Winters said. But the possibility is there for the technology and capabilities of Google Glass to expand over time. And whether or not Google ever changes its stance on facial recognition, third party developers may find ways to integrate such features into wearable devices. Thats why Winters and his partners at Stop the Cyborgs are trying to start a public debate about the issues surrounding wearable tech. While he acknowledges that there are important uses for wearable computers, the impact of allowing just anyone to wear recording devices into homes or businesses shouldnt be ignored. The real issue is about establishing social norms, he said. We felt that if Google Glass was left unchallenged, people would assume that it is okay to wear them everywhere and would not bother to ask permission. To combat that, Stop the Cyborgs offers on its website for business owners or homeowners to let others know that they would prefer Google Glass not be brought inside.","What are net promoter scores? Well, if you have some idea how many of your customers would likely recommend your product or service to a friend, you already have a handle on the idea of Net Promoter Score. Heres how it works.Ask each customer to rate the likelihood theyd recommend you to someone else on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not likely and 10 being extremely likely.Now, group them based on their response. Generally, we might say that those who responded between, say, 7 and 8 are passives. They like your product or service. They may even continue purchasing it. But they arent necessarily going to run out and tell a friend about it. Passives are satisfied customers, but they arent as enthusiastic as your promoters are. These are groups of customers who can switch loyalty in a moments notice. They are not as likely to be overly enthusiastic about your business. Then there are those who responded between 0 and 6. We might call these detractors. We might optimistically say some of them toward the upper end of the scale are at least mildly satisfied with your product or service. More realistically, though, these people are clearly unhappy customers. They can damage your reputation and are likely to spread negative word-of-mouth. Then we come to customers who responded between 9 and 10. These are your promoters. Promoters are loyalists. They are enthusiastic and they keenly believe that your products or services can really help or make a difference to their friends, colleagues, and others. They are firm in their belief that you deliver as a business and they place their complete trust in you. These are people who will do much more than buy from you. They will shout your name from the rooftops, a child after youwell, you get the idea. When youve grouped your customer base this way, youve essentially determined your net promoter score, a very important number for the future growth of your company. Why? Well, it turns out a company can determine its success based on how many customers are willing to recommend its products and services to others. In fact, research shows the percentage of customers who are likely to refer a friend or colleague correlates comparatively with company growth rate and profitability, Frederick F. Reichheld in Harvard Business Review. In other instances, net promoter scores can raise important red flags about customer dissatisfaction. In one instance, poor net promoter scores alerted GEs Healthcare services that most customers were upset about slow response times from engineers. The realization led GE to set up a new call center reducing turnaround per customer request, BusinessWeek . OK, but how valuable a tool is net promoter score when it comes to growing a business and brand? Well, arguably very valuable according to at least one observer. Consider what may be the most famous example of measuring passionate fans to grow a brand, Apple Inc.Late CEO Steve Jobs was legendary for apparently ignoring customer feedback and relying instead on his instincts when it came to developing new products and features. But this reputation can be deceiving, Forbes.com contributor Steve Denning. Denning reviews by Reichheld with Rob Markey. In fact, everything Apple does is meant to cater to its major promoters. How likely are these people to recommend Apples products to friends? Very likely. In fact, Apple has been extremely successful in creating a cult of fans dedicated to its products, Denning writes. How has the company accomplished this? Simply, Apple focuses all its energies, from how it manages its retail stores to every other aspect of its day-to-day operations, on building its net promoter score. For example, Apples store managers call detractors within 24 hours to determine how to improve their experience with the company and its products. The results clearly show Apples success with this strategy. In 2007, Apple stores had anet promoter scoreof 58%. By 2011, that score had risen to 72% with some stores reaching as high as 92%. Of course, its important for small businesses to pay attention to all their customers. But focusing on those passionate enough to spread the word to others about your brand, products and services is key. Its a strategy that can help your business and brand grow quickly by word of mouth without a big marketing budget.","This week, Tech.eu tracked 21 technology M&A transactions, 1 IPO and 56 funding deals (totalling 208.9 million) in Europe, Turkey, and Israel.

Gyms and athletic clubs tend to get more crowded at that time of year from those enacting their New Years resolutions of weight loss, but what about your business? Heres a checklist of some of the top questions to ask to get your small business fit in the New Year: Each year always brings changes to the current tax law and the end of 2012 brought a roller coaster ride full of changes. The payroll tax holiday expired at the end of 2012. Marginal tax rates (for individuals) remained the same for most taxpayers, but were increased for those single filers with taxable income over $400,000 and married filers over $450,000. In addition, there are changes to health savings account and retirement contributions, AMT exemptions, and more. While it has always been smart to meet with a tax advisor or CPA at the beginning of any year, its practically imperative this year given all the changes to business and personal income tax law. Education is your best tool to optimize your tax position. By meeting with a tax advisor as early in the year as possible, youll be in a better position to act on his or her recommendations. Dont be ashamed if youve been conducting business as an individual. Many small businesses start out as sole proprietorships or partnerships, and then eventually transition to a formal business structure. If your business is not incorporated, you may want to consider to establish your company as a separate business entity from you as an individual. Once incorporated as a separate entity, your company may be entitled to claim tax deductions that you could not as an individual (discuss these options with your tax advisor or CPA). In addition, a corporation or LLC structure can help shield you from personal liability when your business is sued or cant pay its debts. If you arent ready to incorporate your business yet, thats okay. But you should at least register your business name with the state. This simple step is known as filing a DBA ( ). By filing a DBA with the state, you are legally able to use a business name. And best of all, you make sure that no one else can use your business name in your state. Bear in mind that while filing a DBA or incorporating will protect your name in your state, these actions alone may not be enough to stop someone from using the same business name in another state. If protecting your brand across all 50 states is important to you, consider filing for trademark protection this year. If you have plans to expand into another state this year, dont forget youll need to file for a foreign qualification in order to legally conduct business outside your home state (or the state where you incorporated/formed an LLC). For example, if you operate a restaurant in Florida and decide to expand into Georgia and South Carolina, youll need to file a foreign qualification in both Georgia and South Carolina. Or, if youre a consultant living in Washington, but are going to be conducting the bulk of your work (and meeting with clients in California), you may need to foreign qualify in California. In order to understand the financial health of your business, youll need to get a hold of exactly how much youre taking in and spending. In addition, youll need accurate and comprehensive records in order to make the most of your business tax deductions and prepare yourself in case youre ever audited. If you have found yourself struggling with this tax in the past, look for a new solution. Whether its outsourcing the task to someone else (like a professional bookkeeper), investing in a new technology tool (like a receipt scanner or cloud-based accounting app), or just resolving to dedicate 30 minutes each week to catch up on your expense tracking. If your business employs any full-time employees, part-time employees, or contractors, you should make sure your records are up to date and you are operating by the book. For starters, make sure you have the current mailing addresses and correct Federal ID numbers for all employees and any vendors/contractors that youll be giving a 1099 to. If youre employing 1099 contractors, you should make sure that they meet the terms for an independent contractor and should not be classified as an employee. The Small Business Association outlines . If you have full-time employees, it might be wise to talk to an employment law attorney to make sure you are in compliance. Dont be a year or two behind. If the copyright year at the bottom of your website still displays a previous year  nows the time to update it. The new calendar year is an ideal time to get your legal foundation squared away to support you for years to come. Dont let daily interruptions keep you from doing something that is fundamentally crucial to your business long-term health and to the security of your finances. Heres to a prosperous and productive new year!","SoundCloud has introduced a new program, the On SoundCloud partner program, that aims to pay creators that upload their audio content to the service.

Quite simply, musicians, podcasters, and others who create original audio can upload their files and share their content with a broader community. is the site where Grammy winner Lorde first uploaded her hit song, . And Small Business Trends usesthe service in our weekly , with host Brent Leary. The SoundCloud service comes in a : To date, there had been no ads on any SoundCloud audio files. But now, with the introduction of the new On SoundCloud program, that will change. And those ads could mean revenue for the people who upload content there. According to a letter posted to the official SoundCloud blog, a limited number of creators will get initial access to the On SoundCloud partner program. Ads will either appear on a SoundCloud player or within a streaming audio file. Any time that a listener hears or sees an ad, the creator of the content where the ad appeared will share in the ad revenue. No specific terms of the revenue sharing program were announced at the time the program was introduced. On the official SoundCloud blog, founder and CEO Alex Ljung : A select number of advertisers and creators have been invited to take part in the On SoundCloud Premier program initially. Ljung indicates in his letter that this program will eventually be expanded to include all creators and more advertisers. Music artists and record labels are the first to be enrolled in it, to The New York Times. SoundCloud is allowing would-be revenue sharers to sign up to receive an invite to join the Premier plan. This plan will allow users access to more promotional tools for their content too. And Premier users will also be able to upload an unlimited amount of content. To sign up for an invite, users will need to have a SoundCloud account already. The platform is also likely to unveil a premium subscription service in the near future. It will allow listeners to pay a subscription fee to skip the new ads altogether. There is no indication yet whether creators will share in that revenue, too.","Have you gotten started with ?

As with most things in life, it has its own set of rules. It doesnt matter what kind of business you run, whether you have venture funding or whether you are using your own savings. The rules still apply. Here are six rules of entrepreneurship that should remind you of the wonderful ride that entrepreneurship really is. You will learn more from these six stories of entrepreneurial struggle than you would from six different books written on entrepreneurship. Well start with big stories first. Persistence is the missing word in entrepreneurship. Ray Kroc is a testimony to persistence. A kitchen wares sales man with health issues at aged 52 took a risk in 1954 and bought out a family-run restaurant. And in doing so created one of the most iconic brands in the world. The menu was limited and the service was quick. It was fast food that really fast for a change. The idea was simple, yet elegant at the time. Though somewhat boring compared to todays tech startups, it comes with a valuable lesson. Run with your imagination. Take that idea and turn it into something great. In short, disrupt. No, we arent talking about Bransons book here. We are talking instead about the very psyche of Sir Richard Branson, a billionaire worth at least two billion dollars and the founder of companies involved in everything from air travel to space tourism. We all know him to be a shrewd businessman with the style of a newbie rock star. Hes charming, social, and completely unpredictable. And his personality seeps through his business. He is a man of action, a relentless entrepreneur, if you will. His first endeavor was a magazine that never took off. He later found a new way for people to enjoy music  lounging around and listening to records before buying. The retail venture become Virgin Records. Serial entrepreneur that he is, he went on to create even more businesses. Some failed. Some rocked. Either way, he never sat there wondering what happened. He just moved on. Get up and do something about that idea. Dreams are nothing if you dont sweat towards them. Screw it. Just do it. No matter what happens. The founder of one of the most popular brands in the tech industry didnt have an easy path. From humble beginning, Jobs navigated through some huge challenges and a major setback to achieve his ambitious goals. Apple started as a small startup, grew into a small but profitable enterprise, and went public, only to have an internal power struggle for control of Apple drive Jobs from the very company he founded. Most entrepreneurs would have simply quit or turned their backs on the past and simply started a new company. Jobs, however, made Apple come to him. He started another business called Next which Apple bought and meanwhile, also founding another successful company, Pixar Studios (now, Disney-Pixar). For Jobs, it was always about design, beautiful rendition of products, and extreme value poured into everything his company makes. Apple does it. Pixar does it. Staying true to the quality of the products and services you provide will see you through the toughest times. Dont give up. No matter what the obstacle. was a professional athlete. But a broken wrist ended his athletic career. Instead of lamenting, Howes simply started another career for himself. Though at the time he says he didnt have a dime to his name. The problem was he had no product to market. But by attending webinars and educating himself about the combination of ideas and action needed to build a successful company, Howes was able to build up a level of expertise he could then share with others trying to do the same. Not having a product to sell is an excuse. When you dont have products, you have services. When you dont have the time or resources for providing services, you can teach or train like Lewis does.

Of course, you can start with much less too but we want to introduce you to Brian Morgan of .

In an interview with Chris Dixon at TechCrunch.com, he offered this advice: divide and conquer. Do what you are best at and let others take care of the rest. Each founder should focus on his or her strengths. Outsource. Hire. Pick the best brains in the business. It comes at a price but its a pittance compared to the profits you make. Learn the art of delegation. Meetup.com run its business and lets groups all over the world with a passion to meet do the rest.

Its the time human resources and benefits professionals spend much of the year preparing for, even though many American workers dont think twice about their health benefits from one year to the next. However, this year, open enrollment should be given a second thought  and maybe third and fourth thoughts, too. According to the 2013 Aflac WorkForces Report, 90 percent of consumers are on autopilot, meaning they select the same health insurance plan year after year. This statistic becomes alarming when coupled with data from Aflacs Open Enrollment survey, which found that as of August 2013, 70 percent of employers had not communicated changes to health benefits as a result of reform, despite the Oct. 1 deadline. What this means is people may be apt to select the same coverage again for 2014 without understanding how their companys health insurance plans have changed.This could lead to wasted funds if workers are paying for extra coverage they wont need. Alternatively, employees could find themselves without some coverage if their insurance benefits have decreased. You may be wondering, How can my small business communicate effectively to employees while also meeting reforms many requirements? The six key messages below can enable you to cut through the noise to help your employees avoid costly mistakes. By Oct. 1, 2013, most small businesses should have told workers whether or not they plan to offer employer-sponsored major medical insurance, and to provide information about the (also known as exchanges) and potential subsidies. Take note, and know that if you have 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, you will be eligible to participate in the Small Business Health Option Program (SHOP) Marketplace next year. If workers purchase coverage through exchanges, they may miss out on employer contributions to company-offered health benefits. They may also lose the tax break from employer contributions that are excluded from federal income taxes. This information should have also been included in the Oct. 1 notice. Workers need to know your companys level of benefits coverage to compare plans accurately. Todays average actuarial value (AV) of employer-provided coverage is 80 to 89 percent.Actuarial value (AV) is the amount a plan is expected to pay, on average, for the Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) offered by the plan. The remaining amount is represented as co-payments, deductibles, and co-insurance and would be paid by the covered individual(s). In addition to offering plans with 80 and 90 percent AVs, the public Health Insurance Marketplace will offer plans with the same benefits levels but lower AVs (60 and 70 percent), which means lower premiums but more of out-of-pocket costs such as copays, deductibles and co-insurance. Talk to employees about your companys investment to paint a clear picture of their total compensation packages. Since health care costs continue to rise, your total contribution can have a substantial effect on workers wallets. Even for those with major medical insurance, voluntary insurance policies can provide a financial safety net in the event of serious illness or injury. Because dental insurance is the only voluntary benefit offered through the public Health Insurance Marketplace, other voluntary options such as disability, life and accident coverage must be purchased separately. If your company offers perks such as a , flex time or discount gym memberships, boast about them during open enrollment. It is the perfect opportunity to educate workers about all your company has to offer. Some might not enroll in these programs, but awareness will improve employees opinions of your companys benefits.","When the data on enrollees in the federal exchanges is tallied later, the fraction of young people is unlikely to meet the 40 percent target the White House has is necessary to keep health insurance premiums from rising significantly next year. A major culprit will be the popularity of the Affordable Care Acts (ACA) provision increasing the age of coverage of dependent children. This provision has led fewer young adults to obtain insurance on the government exchanges. The older-than-hoped-for risk pool that has resulted will lead premiums on insurance purchased on the exchanges to rise next year. Even if young adults have delayed signing up until the last minute, the 40 percent target for the fraction of young adults purchasing insurance on the government exchanges is unlikely to be met. At the end of February, Department of Health and Human Services figures that only 27 percent of enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 34. While the pundits have offered many explanations for the low level of enrollment by young people from the cost of health insurance to a youthful sense of invincibility  one factor has been missed. The ACAs increase in the age limit for dependent coverage has reduced the number of young people seeking insurance. One of the first-implemented provisions of the new law  put in place in September 2010  was a make that coverage available until a child reaches the age of 26, regardless of whether the child is married, in school, living at home, or a dependent for tax or financial purposes. Prior to the passage of the law, young adults in many states lost coverage under their parents plans when they reached their 19th birthday or finished their schooling. This provision shifted many young people to coverage as dependents under their parents health insurance plans. A 2012 National Bureau of Economic Research working paper that the ACA raised the adult dependent coverage by 5.3 percentage points between 2009 and 2010 alone. Analysis by the Heritage Foundation that the probability of moving into dependent coverage among those aged 19 to 25 more than doubled after the law was implemented. The provision reduced the fraction of uninsured young people. The percentage of uninsured Americans aged 18 to 25 declined from 28.4 percent in the first quarter of 2010 to 21.7 in the first quarter of 2014, a Gallup Organization poll . And the NBERs analysis revealed that the provision drove the fraction of uninsured young people down by 3.5 percentage points between 2009 and 2010. But the provision also reduced young peoples participation in the new federal and state exchanges. As the NBER working paper explains, by increasing the number of healthy young adults being covered on their parents insurance plans, the ACAs dependent care provision contributed to making the composition of participants on the new exchanges older and riskier. To compensate for the make up of the risk pool, insurers will likely need to charge those buying insurance on the exchanges higher premiums next year. In the world of policy making, even the most beneficial provisions of a new law sometimes have adverse unintended consequences.","Last month, I wrote an article  . But I feel I missed a few points in the process passing on an incomplete message. I know enough people who have dreamt of starting a company, but they never took the first step. You need courage, and the mindset of an entrepreneur, to test the waters in the ocean of startups. Do you remember the last time you took a risk  something like taking leave for two weeks for vacation without your boss approval? Entrepreneurship is about confronting brutal realities of life where you have to take the risk on a daily basis. You know its not an easy journey. You have to bear a lot of pain. It is scary to leave your job and follow your passion. We hear success stories of startups, but no one tells us how many failures are buried under that success. Frustration hits you like the monthly mobile bill. Every month, we plan something great, but plans fail quite often. We can't avoid the frustration of failure, but we can learn how to handle it. You doubt your decisions many times. You won't find anyone to help you out. This is a side effect of becoming your own boss. You can't ask for directions all the time, even if you have mentors. You doubt yourself. After continuous failures, you start feeling like you arent worthy of anything. Persistence and perseverance are keys to tackling such a situation. This happens with almost every entrepreneur. Addiction to anything has an adverse effect on life. Its even possible for someone to become addicted to smoking or alcohol after starting up, as they use it to alleviate stress. Bad sleep habits take the front seat when you have to deliver a product in time. There is so much chaos, from customers and employees to family, that you often mess up your sleep schedule. My own bad sleep patterns began to affect my productivity, so I started waking up at the same time every day irrespective of my sleep time. My routine adjusted automatically to my sleep timings. Have you experienced this when you don't give time to your girlfriend, wife or kids? Even when you sit with them, you talk about recent funding news, or your difficulties in hiring, or how tough your customer is. Give it a break! Spend some quality time with your family. A very likely situation for bachelor entrepreneurs. You won't have time to cook food. You will subsist on ready-to-eat junk food alone. You had better get on a fruit diet instead. You won't feel it because you are busy building your product or chasing your next customer, but your friends know how many parties you are missing. I am not to scare you, but because I have experienced this in my startup life. If you still want to take a leap then go through the checklist below before taking the final decision. Last question to ask yourself. If I quit my job and follow my passion only to have it fail miserably after two or three years of dedicated work, how will I feel? If you feel terrified, then reconsider your decision. We discussed this question in my previous startup. If I failed, I was willing to bear the pain of failure.

If you just need voice calling and the battery is low, a 10-minute charge will provide 4 hours of talk time. In one stress test, the higher end device ran 26 apps at the same time without any hiccups. Super Resolution mode on ZenFone 2 allows for shooting and displayingvery detailed pictures. This might come in handy for taking pictures of receipts, or if youve got apps with finicky optical character recognition. (OCR tech is only as good as what you provide it, right?) Snapview lets the user have both a business interface and a personal interface on one phone. The anti-virus and other security features help to ensure any employees youve authorized to use a mobile browser do so safely. One feature included on ZenFone 2 that may draw some criticism is the use of a branded user interface, or UI, on top of Android 5.0. This is special skin that a lot of Android device makers apply to their phones or tablets to make them more than just an ordinary Android device. Examples include HTC with its Sense UI and Samsung with its TouchWiz UI. An ASUS official says the company gets the criticism. I can understand this, especially if youre a long-time Android user, Erik Hermanson, head of marketing for mobile products at ASUS told Small Business Trends. Different brands using Android, including ASUS, can give you the same basic experience, and thats part of the beauty of Android. But we feel our skin brings value. In one sense, users want a simple interface if going from device to device. But they also want customizability and flexibility within a UI, and so thats the direction we went, because the ability to customize is something we hear about from a lot of our users. Wed like to give them reasons to keep coming back to the ZenFone in the long run.","Reuters/Toby Melville Business Insider has launched Markets Insider, which combines the best of Business Insider with real time market data .

Wilburn, of Tulsa, Okla., was simply looking for a way to earn some extra money so she could stay at home with her two toddlers. So her mother, Pam Willingham, suggested that she organize a consignment sale for gently used maternity and childrens clothing. Wilburn organized the event with about 17 friends she knew through her church and hosted it in her 400-square-foot living room. After the initial event, word of mouth became a key tool for . People began asking when there would be more events. And Willingham even wrote to friends around the country to tell them about her daughters new business venture, Wilburn . Early on, Wilburn was hosting sales in Tulsa about twice per year. Eventually, she began allowing moms in other cities to use her business model and name. In an interview with CNNs How We Got Started she : With that added confidence, Wilburn put together an official franchise program. It allowed moms around the country already using the name to officially become part of Just Between Friends. Now, Just Between Friends has 95 different locations throughout 20 states. Wilburn eventually sold off her original Tulsa location so that she could focus on the franchise operation. She says it wasnt her intention to start a nationwide franchise. But her business model was so universally appealing to moms around the country that it just caught on and took on a life of its own. And in this case, Wilburn actually benefited from breaking some key rules, like allowing others to use her business name. Since Just Between Friends is a business based on working together and helping moms help themselves, it turned out to be an important part of her companys brand.","The U.S. retail industry is undergoing a sea of change  one that has some small brick-and-mortar retailers reaching for their life vests. How can a small retailer compete in increasingly choppy waters?McKinsey & Company recently identified some . Below isa closer look at the ones I think are most relevant to small retail shop owners. Although the economy is improving, unemployment is still relatively high, and the average consumers confidence is low. While many industry forecasts predict U.S. retail growth of 3 to 4 percent annually for the next 5 years (well below the average 5 to 7 percent annual growth pre-2008), McKinsey believes slow retail growth will extend beyond five years to become the new normal. The growth of eCommerce and the introduction of mobile commerce ( ) have raised the stakes. Consumers expect purchasing and returning items to be quick, easy and seamless  no matter where theyre doing it. The way convenience and big-box stores are adding fresh food items is just one example of how retailers are eating each others lunch by selling products previously not found in their niches. McKinsey identifies three key markets for retailers to target: In the next 10 years, McKinsey says, the 47 million U.S. households headed by people over age 55 will account for the lions share of retail spending growth. For instance, theyll drive 73 percent of housewares growth and 56 percent of apparel growth, thanks to their larger disposable incomes. is projected to almost double in the next decade. They will be responsible for nearly one-fifth of all U.S. retail spending. Apparel, footwear and childrens products are hot categories for Hispanic shoppers. Those ages 13 to 30 make up just 15 percent of U.S. consumers, but by 2020 McKinsey says they will account for nearly one-third of total retail spending. Despite tough economic times, in the last five years has increased by 3 percent annually. Try three of the strategies McKinsey suggests: McKinseys research found that for the average consumer, peer recommendations carry 10 times more weight than a salespersons recommendation. Marketing your retail business on social media is a good start, but make sure youre also encouraging customers to review your store on review and ratings sites, and to share their purchases on Facebook or other social media channels. Reach out to customers with personalized emails based on past purchasing behaviors, or target offers to social media followers who have liked or shared a product on social media. Despite McKinseys data, dont ignore the power of well-informed and helpful salespeople. Older shoppers, in particular, like to get in-person help from real people. Salespeople who remember them, recall what they like and alert them when new merchandise comes in that they might be interested in. This all builds customer loyalty. McKinsey says the average retail stores footprint will shrink in the coming decade as large retailers focus more on eCommerce. Small retailers can benefit from this, too. A smaller, but more carefully edited and curated store is more likely to succeed than a midsized location with a hodge-podge of items. Make every square foot of space as profitable as you can. Consider retail kiosks or small pop-up (temporary) locations as ways to try out new product lines or concepts. McKinsey notes that the retail environment is becoming increasingly experiential. For all three of the demographic groups noted above, brick-and-mortar shopping is a social activity. If you want your retail business to stand out from the big-box pack, offer unique products, deep knowledge of your products and an experience that is enjoyable and memorable. Whether by adding a refreshment bar to your store, offering in-store tailoring of clothes or holding classes to teach customers how to use the cameras you sell, going above and beyond just making the sale will be key to retail success in the coming years.","Only one third of small business owners were able to obtain all of the credit that their businesses need, a recent shows. The surveys finding is not surprising. Many economists, policy makers and small business advocacy groups have long explained that small businesses have a harder time obtaining credit than their larger counterparts. When it comes to accessing capital, size definitely matters. Even among small businesses, the smaller the company, the lower the odds that it has a loan (see figure below) or a line of credit. Only 15.7 percent of businesses with one or fewer employees have a business loan and only 33.7 percent have a line of credit, the NFIB survey shows. By contrast, 56.8 percent of businesses with between 50 and 250 workers has a business loan and 65.4 percent has a line of credit. Rather than reveal some sinister motives among bankers, however, these patterns simply reflect the economics of business credit. Fewer small businesses have access to credit than larger companies because lending to them is riskier and more expensive than extending credit to larger companies. Default risk is higher in the small business loan market. Small businesses fail at higher rates than big businesses and changes in the business cycle have a larger impact on their profits. Because lenders cannot always charge interest rates that are commensurate with a borrowers default risk, the most risky small business borrowers are often unable to get credit. Lending to small businesses is more expensive than lending to big companies. Part of the problem is the fixed cost of making a loan. Some costs are the same whether you make a $50,000 loan or a $5 million loan. Therefore, profit margins are higher on bigger loans. Of course, larger companies are more likely to need bigger loans than their smaller counterparts, which leads lenders to focus on larger customers. Additionally, evaluating small business loan applications is often expensive. Little publicly available information on the financial condition of small companies exists, and small businesses financial statements are not always very detailed. Small business owners personal finances are sometimes intermingled with those of their businesses. The very large variety of small businesses and the way they use borrowed funds make it tough to apply general lending standards. Finally, monitoring the financial condition of small businesses often requires lenders to build personal relationships with small business owners. These economic principles have important implications for those seeking to boost small businesses access to credit. Encouraging more lending will require policies that take into account the greater cost and risk of lending to small companies  and why small businesses have trouble getting credit.","The U.S. Senate is considering legislation that would create a pool of 75,000 immigrant visas. The idea behind these visas is to encourage new business startups. Supporters cite data suggesting Startup Visas, as they are called, could eventually create 1.6 million new jobs over the next decade. , the United States is falling behind due to its immigration policies. A number of top CEOs have recently stated that the nations immigration policy needs to be less restrictive. They say the system should encourage people wishing to come to the U.S. to start new tech businesses here. The Senate is considering the creation of 75,000 Startup Visas in the bill known as Startup Act 3.0. The stated goal is to encourage foreign individuals to create startup businesses in the U.S. The visas would offer speedy access to permanent resident status if an immigrant entrepreneurs business can earn or invest at least $100,000 and employ two full-time people not in the immigrants immediate family in the first year. If an entrepreneurs business fits these criteria, he or she will get a three-year visa and eventually can apply for permanent resident status. Historically, immigrants who have lived the American Dream, coming to this country and starting their own businesses, have boosted the economy.  A report from The Kauffman Foundation suggests the proposed in the next decade. The organizations data suggests that about one-half of all those visas would be used by immigrants wanting to enter the tech or engineering sector. The Economist cites another recent study showing that for every job created by a tech startup, another 4.3 jobs will be created in the tech companys local economy. These jobs are often in the service industry and cater to the spending habits of those employed by the startup. The report notes, They also have a broader impact on employment Well-paid techies shop a lot and hire others to iron their shirts. The Kauffman Foundation states that the number of tech startups in the U.S. has fallen from 52 to 44 percent since 2005. One entrepreneur, interviewed in the Economist article, suggests the drop is the result of fewer immigrants seeking permanent residence because of the difficulty in the process. To get a Startup Visa under the proposed law, an immigrant must already be in America on an H-1B or student visa. The Economist reports demand for H-1B visas in the U.S. is already so high that the annual supply of 65,000 visas for these workers was oversubscribed in just one week. The Startup Visa program, like most things related to U.S. immigration policy these days, has had its detractors often along political lines. Still, theres support from many quarters, especially in Silicon Valley, and theres even a website called .","Adam Pretty/Getty Images Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian ever, and his medal count at the Rio Olympics has continued to climb. The swimmer has long been the modern Olympian with the most individual records. Now, he's even coming up against records set 2,168 years ago. As of August 10, Phelps had tied the ancient record set by Leonidas of Rhodes for the most individual wins (12). And he still has a couple more events to go. So what makes Phelps such an incredible swimmer? Many have pointed out that he has a perfect physique for swimming, and they're not wrong: Skye Gould/Tech Insider In sports in general, there has been a sort of a ""size sort"" over recent decades, where athletes have started to focus on sports that they have an ideal body type for, Dr. Michael Joyner , a physician and Mayo Clinic researcher who is one of the world's top experts on fitness and human performance, told Business Insider. Interestingly, said Joyner, elite performers in certain sports tend to be about the same size, as you can see if you look at rowers, gymnasts, and of course, swimmers. Phelps certainly fits the bill . But there has also been unproven speculation out there that Phelps has extreme qualities that make him such a good swimmer, such as the myth that he has double the lung capacity of the average human. (There's no actual evidence for this, and Dr. H. Richard Weiner, a swimmer and former team physician who practiced sports medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, previously told Scientific American that some of the claims about Phelps border on the ridiculous.) While Phelps is certainly built for swimming, most of his competitors are too. They're tall, strong, long-armed, and frequently have longer-than-average torsos and relatively shorter legs. As "" The Sports Gene "" author David Epstein pointed out in a TED talk, even star water polo players share physiology that's different from the average person. But it takes more than just build to get to where Phelps is. As Weiner explained to Scientific American, physical advantages aren't sufficient on their own. You also have to have talent and technique, like Phelps' excellent stroke mechanics. If you've watched Phelps during the Rio Olympics, you'll see that he has intense focus, drive, and a competitive nature too. All of those seem to be pretty important characteristics of a top Olympian. It's the combination of all these factors that makes Phelps such an amazing athlete. Yes, his body is partly responsible, but that's not all.

As more businesses (and my own consulting company) are spending more time on content marketing, the same questions that small businesses have had about channels like SEO and PPC have started to pop up surrounding content marketing: This is so expensive  how can I do this on {insert extremely limited budget here}? As with SEO (and, well, life) theres no magic answer, but there are some specific approaches you can take to executing on content marketing so that you can get traction as a budget-constrained, busy small business owner. In this article,Ill walk through three ways that small businesses can take to leverage contentmarketing on a shoestring budget. Lets start with some real talk If you have a few hundred dollars a month to spend on content marketing, you cant afford a real content marketing agency, or even to hire out for a consistent freelance content resource. Youre going to have to have someone in your company spend time on content marketing. For some of you, this should probably be where you get off. If you cant spend time or more than a couple hundred dollars on content marketing, focus on another area of your business. Just because its a bit of a buzzword recently, that doesnt mean every single business needs to go allin on investing in content marketing. You need to do whats best for your business. If you dont have the time or budget to dedicate to content creation, your first step is to go and find it. You will not get traction if you have neither time nor budget. Now, assuming you have some time but are extremely limited on budget, what should you actually be doing as it relates to content creation and promotion? First answer this question: This could take any number of forms: If you (or someone in your company) isnt good at creating the content, you wont stick with it and it wont be helpful. Infrequent, unhelpful content is probably than producing no content at all. Ideally, you should know the answer to the questions: where do your prospects hang out online? and where do your prospects look for information about (or actually go to purchase) your solution online? If you do, you can basically skip this step and move right to applying your strengths from step one to the distribution channel your prospects frequent. If you dont know the answer to this question yet, there are a couple of things you can do to quickly help you figure it out: Once you have a handle on the type of content you want to create and where you need to be promoting it, you can leverage what budget you do have to pour a bit of content marketing gasoline on the   youre starting. While youll need to do the bulk of the work around content creation and promotion yourself if your budget is limited, you can get some value out of that limited budget by mapping it to your content weaknesses or content holes as best you can. As youre working on content creation and promotion, identify the areas that are either really giving you trouble, or the more low value andmundane tasks that are eating up a lot of your time and spend your budget there. Some examples: The main idea with all of this is to identify the areas where you can get the biggest returns for the time and budget output that you can afford. Focus on highlighting your strengths, and use your limited budget to cover over whatever weaknesses you can and you can execute on an effective content marketing campaign for business, even on a tiny budget.","Business is increasingly performed in a virtual workspace, which has fueled a growing demand for digital signature technology. a form-building platform, recently launched the Adobe Document Cloud eSign Widget, which allows users to embed esigning into any form.

It is an area that has seen little liberalisation, though in the July 1991 reform budget, as finance minister allowed the prices of potassic and phosphatic fertilizers to float and raised urea prices by 40 percent, only to roll it back by 30 percent following an outcry. Reforms however improved the terms of trade which were adverse to agriculture, by reducing import duties (and prices) of manufactured goods. Devaluation of the rupee made profitable. Farmers could get international prices for their produce, so long as jittery governments did not impose curbs to tame domestic inflation. But farming is associated with gloom and doom. It is painted as a hopeless activity that drives farmers to suicide. Yet as a category, more housewives kill themselves than farmers, according to data on the website of the National Crime Records Bureau. Of course there is distress in the countryside, caused by weather and price risks, poor access to markets, and the non-availability of working capital at affordable rates. Cultivating small parcels, which a majority of farmers do, is not profitable, unless it is high- value agriculture done in climate controlled poly-houses. National surveys show more farmers want to leave agriculture than remain engaged and they certainly do not wish the vocation on their sons. But travelling extensively through the countryside over the past eighteen months to report on smart agriculture, I have come across pockets of vibrancy. Ismailbhai Rahimbhai Sheru, 63, advices graduate sons of farmers not to hanker after government jobs. Based on experience, he says, a guy with five acres of farmland can earn Rs 5 lakh a year, or Rs 40,000 a month. A resident of Rampur Vadla village in Banaskanthas Amirgarh taluka, Sheru made headlines when as prime ministerial aspirant, felicitated him at a public event in the run up to the 2014 . He had grown potatoes each weighing more than two kg. Sheru was growing them on contract to McCain, a supplier of French fries and potato patties to McDonalds. Sheru started off 36 years ago, despite the wishes of this father, who wanted his son with a first class B.Com degree to take up a salaried job. But through dint of hard work and scientific farming, Sheru made enough cash flows to turn an inheritance of debt and six acres of indifferent land into thriving agriculture spread over 400 acres. Sheru likes contract farming because it takes care of the price risk. In January 2015, when there was a potato glut in the country and prices slumped to less than Rs 2 a kg, he got the contracted Rs 8 a kg. There are years when he gets less than spot rates but over time this evens out. Parthibhai Jethabhai Chaudhary, 58, a police officer who doubles up as a farmer credits McCain with teaching growers the art of potato cultivation. Before the company came, flood irrigation used to be the norm, says the resident of Dangiya village in Banaskanthas Dantiwada taluk. The amount of water used in a potato field would stack up to 750 mm by end of the season, a field-level McCain executive said. Farmers have now switched to drip or sprinkler irrigation, which not only saves water but also fertilizer and pesticides (as insects do not thrive in low humidity). Chaudhary, who has a reputation for extracting large yields from his 87-acre farm, says the trick is to be in sync with nature and the rhythm of the crop. He plants between 1 and 10 October so that the crop can make the most of the bulking period starting 20 December, when weather ensures that potatoes add around 1,200 kg per hectare per day. Chaudhary learnt scientific cultivation through McCain, but currently supplies to Balaji Wafers which gives him a better price. He takes leave from work during sowing and harvesting. The rest of the time, he leaves the farm to his manager and 16 worker-families. Every operation, from fertilizer application to the quantity and duration of , is mapped. Workers have been trained to stick to the process. They get a bonus for targets achieved. Chaudhary keeps potatoes in cold storage and sells them when prices are high. When met last year, Chaudhary said he had sold potatoes worth more than Rs 3 cr the previous year and had made a handsome profit. In Maharashtras Jalgaon district I met Tenu Dongar Borole, 62, and Laxman Onkar Chaudhari, 64, both of them banana growers. One was a tea seller at the village square and used to be condescendingly called Tenya. He is now Tenu Seth. The other was a thwarted primary school teacher. They lease in more land than they own. They owe their prosperity to the Grand Naine variety, which Jain Irrigation imported from Israel in the 1990s. The company sells tissue cultured saplings which are disease-free and grow uniformly. Unlike local varieties, Grand Naine yields fruit every year and requires re-planting after three years. Two stump (or ratoon) crops yield fruit in between. Jain Irrigation also supplies drip irrigation equipment which not only saves water but also fertilizer, which is applied in a soluble form (called fertigation). The companys agronomists teach farmers how to maintain the required humidity within the gardens in dry Jalgaon and get the plants to cope with heat stress. As a result, Jalgaon has become a big producer of bananas. If it were a state it would rank fifth in the country in banana production. The point I wish to make is that agriculture can be profitable if scientific principles are applied and technology is deployed. takes care of the price risk. If farmers band together they can engage agronomists, obtain discounts on inputs and have buyback arrangements with food processors or large retailers, who in turn can tell them what to grow and how to grow it. Sadly our governments treat farmers as supplicants to be placated with subsidies. Our policies must strive to make agriculture profitable to enterprising farmers while creating off-farm jobs for those who do not have a stomach for it.","LGs leather clad flagship smartphone, , will begin rolling out to key markets this week. On the heels of this announcement, LG has also revealed two additional members of the G4 family, the G4 Stylus and the G4c. Both are scheduled to launch in the weeks to come. These two new additions will unfortunately not be sporting the G4s signature leather back. However they will be offering differing size options for customers who like the specs of the G4 but wish it was bigger or smaller. The LG G4 Stylus, available as G Stylo in North America and Korea, boasts a 5.7-inch display. This is slightly larger than the G4s 5.5 inches. As you have probably guessed by the name, the phone comes with a LG Rubberdium Stylus to make note taking and drawing easier. Those looking for a smaller option can consider the G4c, coming in at a petite, by comparison, 5 inches. LG claims the G4c, offers many of the G4s premium features and styling but in a more compact form factor. Customers will have the option to buy the G4 Stylus in either an LTE or 3G configuration. No such option is being offered for the G4c, which is LTE only. While both phones sport similarities with the G4, they are nonetheless a downgrade from the flagship. Unlike the G4s 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, the LG G4 Stylus and G4c will only offer 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. They will offer micro SD for added storage, but its still a far cry from the G4. The LTE version of the LG G4 Stylus and G4c both have a 1.2GHz Quad-Core processor. Oddly enough, the 3G version comes with a 1.4 GHz Octa-Core processor, so it looks like customers will have to choose between a faster phone or better Internet. Both phones will run Android 5.0 Lollipop, another downgrade from G4s Android 5.1 operating system. Shipping for the LG G4 will begin in Hong Kong followed by Turkey, Russia and Singapore. LG says shipping will continue throughout the month of June eventually reaching most of Europe, North America, CIS, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South Central America. Pricing and additional purchasing information for all three of LGs new phones will be announced locally at the time of availability. This information may vary depending on carrier and market.","Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Abhishek Lodha, MD of Lodha Developers says that it is unlikely to see overall decline in realty prices.

Jon Ferrara, Founder of relationship intelligence application , shares his take on what it takes for traditional sales professionals to build successful relationships with very different customers than theyre use to. Jon also discusses the role insights vs. instincts plays in sales today, and will play in the future as more social signals are created, processed and distributed through social channels. * * * * * Sales has always been social. Business has always been social. People buy from people they like and they like people who know them. You cant know somebody without doing your homework, without doing your background research to get to know who that person is, who that company is and figure out how you might best be able to serve them. Because sales is about service. If you start out from the service mentality and figure out how you can help that other business person or that company grow, from that perspective, if you do that on a daily basis, you will have success in selling. So social selling isnt different other than the term. Social CRM, where were starting to apply the idea of social to customer-facing business practices, that allow us to do what is old-fashioned smart: connecting to the right customer at the right time on the right channel with the right message. Authentically and relatively building a relationship with them so you have the opportunity to serve them. Theres a new buyer journey. Theres a new social customer that, in the old days, the marketing department would yell at and interrupt that person and get them to line up in front of their sales person, who controlled the conversation, controlled the marketing material and bag them and tag them. Thats the old way of selling. Today, customers are doing their own homework. Theyre having conversations among themselves on what theyre going to buy and then theyre making the buying decision without talking to a sales person. Then when theyre ready, they reach out and they yell back and expect an authentic and relevant response. Most companies idea of dealing with that is to hire a 25 year old kid and have them listen to whos yelling at them. Or worse yet, to have the market department yell at the customer about how great their price and services are. Today, a new social sales person needs to participate in the buyer journey by being a trusted advisor who is paying the relationship forward by inspiring and educating them. So that when they do make a buying decision or are considering buying something, they think about the sales person and also bring their friends with them. I think thats a great question. And as you move outside of social tech andinto the middle of America and the rest of the world, where people still think that Facebook is someplace where you hook up with your high school sweetheart and LinkedIns a place to get a job and Twitters a place where a bunch of propeller heads tell each other when theyre going to the bathroom, and theyre basically telling you that my customers arent social. Its hard to argue with those people and you shouldnt. Because ultimately, what theyre going to see is their peers or their competitors are outmaneuvering them by being a modern salesperson who is focused on paying relationships forward and by serving their customers as their customer advisor. Even a company as big and as old as IBM is adopting social selling and empowering their customer base and business team members to begin educating and engaging with customers to build their individual brands, which ultimately builds the company brand. If IBM can do it, cant you and I? Absolutely. When somebody is ready to make a buying decision, if you are not part of that conversation during the moments where theyre considering it, youre done. On a regular basis, I share content every day to build my brand and grow my network. I probably get 100  150 signals a day of people +1-ing, and liking, commenting, retweeting or otherwise engaging with my brand. Then hundreds more on the Nimble brand. How do you figure out which one of those signals matter? As a social salesperson, if youre at all successful at sharing content that inspires and educates, you then have to respond to those signals. The worst is to create engagement and then not follow through. So there is a signal, somebodys following me on Twitter. Do you go and look at who follows you every day on Twitter? But you cant. You really cant if youre at all successful. You cant monitor your signals and thats why you need an intelligent relationship platform that will look at your signals, identify ones that matter, surface them into complete records that you can now authentically and relevantly connect to. Im going to say that instincts outweigh insights and its going to be 60/40 or maybe even 70/30. I really believe that the intelligent engagement and relationship systems are going to balance the power of people with less experience. The intelligence that will be provided by these systems are going to drive it closer to 50/50. I can see a time where a human being aided with a second brain-intelligent relationship platform outperform somebody with instincts without the insights.","Back in 2011, Goggle introduced the , the exact moment that a consumer, whether a business (B2B) or individual (B2C) goes online to find the product or service that will fulfill their need. ZMOT is all about being present in the time and place that a customer needs you. Google contends that your brand, or at least its content, needs to be there at the ZMOT (via search or on social media) or you will lose the sale to a competitor: How many of those times do you show up?

One standout is Dante Lee ( ), CEO of Diversity City Media and founder of BlackPR.com and BlackNews.com. His book breaks new ground by fusing insights from past leadership with those from new entrepreneurs who have staked successful claims. I learned about his book while browsing a bookstore, and picked up a copy for review. Lee opens the book with history and statistics on minority startups, then segues into a Q&A with established business leaders such as Bob Johnson, founder of BET, Wally Amos of Famous Amos cookies, and George Fraser, founder of the FraserNet conference. He also wisely highlights Frarah Gray, the youngest black business millionaire outside of entertainment; Tom Burrell of Burrell Communications; Nadine Thompson, founder of Warm Spirit; and Gwen Richardson, founder of Cushcity.com. Theres also a foreword by Randall Pinkett, author of , so a cross-generation of leaders appears throughout the segment and book. is written to coach a person starting out in entrepreneurship. It is not extremely deep in subject matter, but as perspective-packed as it is in a 289-page paperback format, its not supposed to guide your every step in a specific industry. Lee offers a number of resources appropriate to the topic, be it freelancers, consultants or those seeking government grants. is a great gateway for readers who are approaching business building from many lifestyles. Understandably, Lees forteonline mediashows in the chapter on cyberpreneurs. He clearly understands todays entrepreneurial landscape. For example, Lee cautions against obsession with hits, an argument I have read many times online, but Lee frames the right explanation of how measuring hits has no relationship with serving your customers: Nobody cares how many hits your website gets. Moreover, the suggested resources are perfect for businesses looking for an African American online audience but unaware of which sites are best for potential engagement. Some of Lees advice can seem too anecdotal, especially in the opening segments, but it is meant to summarize material that may be best studied in a longer book. Take, for example, a comment about offering a product or service that can be copied by competitors. Lee does go on to describe five ways to lock it down. But books like which examines how to dissect services to discover new offerings to customers, expound using actionable details and methodologies. Yet the advice that is better served with further detail segues into meatier, straightforward segments on best business practices, finance, and marketing tips. Lee grounds these tips with seasoned business acumen. As a result, chapters read in down-to-earth language and convey brilliant experience, rather than the Top 10 blogpost outtakes found in many books today. The business grant information is particularly useful, eliminating the myths and highlighting the facts. Lees best comments provide answers to situations with detrimental outcomes. When addressing family and friends who want the free hook up he provides a solution: Another tip directs our attention to bad clients and the value of time to good clients: Lee also offers splendid tips aimed at authors who seek media promotion for their latest release.

Its not just the Big 4, , , , and that are acting as branding mouthpieces of B2B and B2C brands. Other social media channels are also making their presence count. Case in point being , and . The number of active users across different social media channels boggles the mind. As of September 2012, Facebook had and a relatively new social media phenomenon like Pinterest has over 20 million active users and counting. You know where I am heading. Businesses can no longer afford to pick and choose from the various social networks available. Each one of them has its own unique selling proposition. While Twitter is a great platform for professional branding using personal communication, Facebook helps businesses provide a comprehensive social media message replete with pictures, videos and all kinds of textual content. If you want to directly take your brand to industry professionals, a presence on LinkedIn is a must and Google+ is a coming together of tremendous benefits that Google brings to the table. If you are looking for sales ready users, Pinterest is the platform to beat. Today you cant do without well-rounded social media presence. All channels are interrelated and each of these channels is a touch point in your customer conversion funnel. There are social media channels that support traffic generation, while there are others that manage your businesss reputation, and there are still others that help you identify potential leads. You cant afford to ignore any one of them. The mix of social media channels that you prefer to work with can differ depending on your businesss niche but there is no doubt that you cant ignore the use of multiple social media channels to drive business profitability. If you want your social media presence to deliver value, you need to be able to make sense of all the turbulence and frothiness associated with social media. Social media can offer incisive customer insights, identify critical buying behavior patterns, improve customer services and increase customer retention. But only if you are able to monitor social media and track all your social media channels and analyze and evaluate their results. You must be able to organize and manage your social accounts seamlessly to ensure the continued success of your social media presence. The idea is to control your social work flow, identify the actionable intelligence from the word clouds and automated reports that are more of distraction than anything else. This is a huge challenge. Its a challenge because your businesss presence is spread across diverse social media channels. Your presence on different social networks like Facebook, Twitter etc. will be tracked using diverse metrics and will yield different results. For example, if you are evaluating your YouTube presence, performance metrics like video views, audience retention (amount of video watched by target audience), number of subscribers, ratio of views to number of user interactions come into play. On the other hand, the performance of your Twitter presence is dependent on metrics like follower count, number or retweets, comparison with peers and others. The sheer diversity of metrics makes monitoring a real challenge. The simple answer is that it does. But, there is a problem here. No, the problem isnt the quality of the available tools but the sheer number of different available in the market. Most of us end up using different tools for different social media channels. In such cases, what we are essentially doing is using different dashboards to track different results, a recipe for disaster, if there was one. To keep track of all the results and social data pouring in from different dashboards is a situation made in hell and something that cannot be kept up with for any amount of time.So should we use them or shouldnt we? Of course, we should and this isnt a debatable point but the focus must be on using a single dashboard for keeping track of all your social media channels and monitor social media from one place. Monitoring social media business metrics from a allows you to take control of all your business data from one place. You dont have to access different tools every morning to see how your business is doing. You can simply create a customized dashboard to track all the information you want. A business analytics tool like is a good example of a one-stop dashboard that helps you track business performance form a single place. Apart from getting brand-specific Facebook Insights data you also get access to YouTube Analytics, Twitter Analytics, Google Trends information and a range of other social and search data and all this from a single location. As the assimilation, evaluation, and analysis of all information about your brand performance on different social channels takes from one place, you get a clearer picture of your brand presence and its engagement with its target customers at various levels. You can make better sense of all the actionable intelligence at your disposal. You spend less time monitoring social media results scattered all across the Web, and more time using this data to improve your social media presence. You dont have to be a genius to realize monitoring social media data using a single dashboard is way better than using different social media monitoring tools to track your social media presence. It just makes better sense.","Its that time again! Its the time when and his crew release a brand new edition of the annual report, causing all of to go over it with a fine toothed comb to understand which tactics hurt, help or dont even affect our sites ranking. Its a years worth of local search education packed into one document!

This years Ranking Factors report analyzes the most important factors as related to: While there are insights to be gleaned from each category, I thought it was particularly interested that even as the local search ecosystem is in constant flux, many of the basics have not changed. Participants all agreed that factors like having your physical address in the city of search, proximately of address to the centroid, consistency of information, and proper category association are all in the top ten for specific factors for overall ranking. For me (and Id think for many small business owners), theres a small degree in comfort in that and something SMBs can take to the bank. Even though we all need to adjust to the always-changing Google algorithm and incorporate things like Google+ and Google+ Local Pages into our strategies, many of the fundamentals are still present. Get those down and you set yourself up on the right foot. Something else worth noting  make sure to pay special attention to the section that looks at Place Page Factors. As we all move from Google Places to Google+ Local Pages, knowing the factors that are important to ranking in Google Place Pages will help ensure that you set your new page up correctly and that youre focusing on the metrics that Google is most interested in.

The whole day was spent chatting with other SMB owners and learning from experts.   While I had the chance to sit in on a number of great sessions, one that particularly stuck out was the Tools for Small Business panel. Surprising to me was that the tool being discussed wasnt Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn. It was all about getting press coverage from media outlets, specifically newspapers. Yes, I know what youre saying  newspapers are dying! Theyre extinct!  But the truth is, theyre not. Getting local press coverage can help you build exposure, establish expertise and allow you to grow your business. Also, all the advice shared for getting local newspaper coverage can easily be tweaked to help you get coverage from online media, as well. So, its a win/win! As a small business owner, how do you get your SMB in the news? Here are some tips from the people who know. :  Before you pitch a story idea or send an editor an e-mail, do your research.  Whether youre looking to pitch a blog, a newspaper or a mix of the two, you want to be familiar with the outlet youre going after. You should know the types of stories they cover, what sections you can get your business to appear in and what the audience of that paper responds to. This will show you whether or not youre a good fit for inclusion and if your audience is even reading this publication. If theyre not, then its not going to do you much good to get coverage there. Doing your research also allows you to bring something to the table when its time to pitch. : Many SMBs are afraid to pitch stories to local media.  They think that theyll be bothering someone, that the reporter has another story in mind or that the person on the other end wont find it useful.   If you have something worthwhile to pitch, dont let fear stop you.   Understand that reporters busy. Theyre busy just like you are. That means they cant be aware of all the news thats going on. They rely on relevant tips/pitches/scoops to help fill their space. If you know something about your business and you want to see a story about it, pick up the phone or drop an editor an email to let them know.  The fact that theyre busy is you need to pick up the phone, not a reason to avoid it. :  Always be on the lookout for ways to insert your business into timely issues.  If your local paper ran a story about how to improve your plumbing last month, they probably wont be running another one this month. So dont pitch that idea. Look for another angle or a way to tie your company into things that are happening in the region or the news. The companies that get the most news coverage are the ones that know how to create stories. That means either creating a press opportunity or finding ways to tie your business into current events. If youre whats hot, newspapers will have no choice but to cover you. : Sometimes getting coverage is a matter of speaking the same language as the editor whose eye youre hoping to catch.  This is, again, a reason to familiarize yourself with the outlet as much as you possibly can to get an understanding of what they do and what they like. Know what part of the paper you want to be in, what types of stories they cover and how theyre written.   How can you build the best presence? : This is a super important point that I think many SMBs miss out on. It doesnt matter if the outlet itself is offline or online, the people who write for it are on the Web interacting in social media. Look for them, follow them, friend them and then start talking to them.  Often newspapers, TV outlets and magazines will use their Twitter handle on air/in print/on their Web site.  Make note of it and seek them out. If they dont list it, do a Twitter or Facebook search to find it.  Use a site like to track down Twitter Lists filled with local or niche media outlets.    Building relationships with reporters of news outlets you want coverage from makes it easier to pass stories back and forth. : The right time to approach reporters is when you have a story that will benefit their audience.  Pick and choose when to make contact to get maximum coverage, as the same outlet can only give you so much coverage.  When should you get in touch? And think ahead. If you know you have an event coming up or want something in Sundays printed calendar, get it in at least three weeks before the printed publication.  You cant call a newspaper on Thursday about an event taking place that weekend.   You also want to know you should be contacting.  Check the news outlets masthead or Web site for the names of the reporters that cover your area or beat. Dont e-mail the Editor In Chief when you should really be e-mailing a hungry beat reporter. As a small business owner, you always want to be on the lookout for ways to make your business relevant and worthy of local press attention.  The tips above should help give you a solid foundation on how to reach out, when to do it and what to say when you open that door.","I dont normally review two books by the same author in a single year because getting one book published in a year is often more than any author can do. But Max McKeown is another story. I introduced you to Max when I reviewed , which was really published as part of a series by . Inside the same envelope, I also found . is Max McKeowns new book that was also released in 2012. My friend John is a savvy CEO. He started a manufacturing company about ten years ago from nothing and has grown it into a multi-million dollar business. I think that one of the reasons for his success is his ability to stand firm on his mission and values and adapt on everything else. For example, hes firmly committed to outrageous customer service and having fun with running his business. And everything else is up for grabs. Hes a master of adapting his business and his life based on whats going on around him. He does this naturally; its intuitive for him. But what about the rest of us? How important is adaptability and how can we harness it to manage our businesses and our lives in a way that doesnt drive us into extinction? As you read youll begin to see patterns and strategies that you can begin to take on inside your own life and business strategy. Youll find these nuggets of wisdom inside the text that will make you take a moment, put the book down and start thinking about how youre going to remind yourself to do this when you get the opportunity. Heres one that I found: McKeown uses Levi Strauss as an example. The company proactively made a commitment to water reclamation and quality back in 1992. Then in 2007, they took a deeper look at the life cycle of the famous 501 jean and discovered that over 3000 liters of water are used from the production of cotton through the process through keeping them clean. Thats when they went into a partnership with P&G to raise awareness of the benefits of using cold water to wash the jeans. So whats the adaptation here? Being proactive and saying something and doing something instead of hiding it from their customers  which might have been the default action. is filled with story after story, case study after case study, example after example just like the one I shared here. The overall lesson of the book is that you dont have to adapt or die as if there isnt any other choice. You can adapt and thrive because you HAVE choices. Inside , McKeown references millions of years of evolution to create a practical and strategic set of strategies that will change how you think about adaptation. Instead of adapting because you HAVE to, you can take on adapting because you WANT to. Max McKeown ( ) is an English writer, consultant and researcher specializing in innovation strategy, leadership and culture. He has written six influential books and conducts research with Warwick Business School. When I originally introduced you to Max McKeown, I told you that he is known as someone who can take complex ideas and simplify them in a way that gets you engaged and excited about implementing them. I would have to agree after having read two of his books. Innovation is a popular strategy that business books like to throw around as a sort of silver bullet to success. As I was reading, I have to say I found myself wondering what the distinction was between innovation and adaptability. Heres how McKeown answers that question: is organized into three parts: I recommend that you have a notebook handy or a highlighter because youre bound to come across cool tidbits of adaptability strategies that youll want to bring with you as you run your business. Dont be surprised if you find yourself thinking differently about everything and maybe acting or reacting to things differently after youve read this book. This is a book that a broad audience will find valuable; business owners, entrepreneurs, employees and maybe even students. will tickle your brain and get you thinking in new ways about how you might handle things differently.","Alexandra Suzanne Greenawalt makes people look good for a living, as a . Its a job that plenty of girls playing dress up would love to aspire to, if they only knew it was an option. Greenawalt didnt originally set out to start her own styling business. But she was once one of those girls playing dress up, and knew that she wanted to be involved in fashion somehow. She said in an email interview with Small Business Trends: Prior to starting her personal styling business, Greenawalt worked in the public relations field, as publisher of an online style magazine, and as a fashion stylist for photo shoots. She also majored in French in college, even though she had no real intention of using that degree in any conventional career oriented way. She just knew that it would get her to Paris, where she could try to break into the fashion industry. Now, she focuses on working individually with real women (as opposed to fashion models) to help them look their best. Though her days vary, Greenawalt said that working with clients normally involves several steps. First, she helps them define their style. Then they sort existing items, shop for clothing and accessories, go to fittings and style outfits and accessories together. She even has clients who fly to New York from all over the world to shop with her. But its not all about playing dress up, though that is certainly part of her job. She said that other skills, particularly business related skills, are essential to making it as a stylist: She recommends that anyone interested in building a career as a stylist should get savvy in things like marketing, SEO, sales, promotions, and building a Web presence. Aside from learning about business, Greenawalt also received formal training in color and shape analysis, which helps her more scientifically determine what looks good and why. But she does admit that having a natural eye for style helps. Though its been a long road from a young girl playing dress up to a professional stylist, Greenawalt said that helping women find their style and confidence makes it all worth it.","Forget Shamu-sized screens. The latest Motorola is said to have a camera that strays into pro territory. And if thats not enough, the new Droid Turbo is believed to be built with wireless (Qi) charging. A recent tweet by famed tech leaker Evan Blass of gives us our at the new device. Motorola is trying to make a splash in the hyper-competitive smartphone market. And to do so, it looks like the company is focusing on some big innovations when building its latest line of devices. A recently leaked users guide for the Droid Turbo hints that the device will definitely be available through Verizon when finally released. The image leaked by Blass shows a distinct Verizon logo near the bottom the devices too. The manual covers a number of the features unique to the new phone as well as its technical specs. First, the Droid Turbo is expected to have a 5.2-inch display, Android Police . Thats smaller than the 5.92-inch display on the recently released Nexus 6 code-named . But what the yet-to-be-released phone may lack in screen size, it appears to more than make up for in the quality of its camera. The users guide indicates the new phone will include a 21-megapixel rear-mounted camera. Thats about as powerful as the camera included on the newly-introduced . The Lumix CM1 is Panasonics new high end camera with phone features. Motorola also adds to the cameras capabilities with dual flash. The users guide reportedly also describes flash units spaced on either side of the cameras lens. Another interesting feature of the Droid Turbo will apparently be wireless charging. But Motorola will also apparently make the phone compatible with its new turbo charger, reports indicate. While it wont have Siri, Cortana, or even OK Google, the Droid Turbo will feature Moto Assist, Motorolas own virtual assistant smartphone app. Moto Assist will adapt to your routine keeping back all but important calls when you are in a meeting or at home at night. You can also use voice commands to activate voice mail or even tell your phone to ring to allow you find it if its been misplaced. The leaked photo also seems to confirm descriptions of the phones physical appearance. The Droid Turbo is expected to feature a metal and fiber glass body and Kevlar coating and come in red and black.","You dont have to wait for the holidays to send out business gifts. There are several different groups of people that might warrant gift giving. But if youre wondering when to give business gifts and who to give them to, a general rule of thumb is to send gifts to the people who help make your company great. In general, this includes clients, employees, and certain service providers. Read on for some tips about when to give business gifts and who you should send them. You should send something small to all of your companys clients at least once a year. Gifts keep you at the top of clients minds year round, Forbes contributor John Hall. And even as some companys cut back in recent times due to the economic crunch, others continue to be convinced gift giving is important for maintaining relationships, the Sacramento Business Journal. If your company has a small number of clients, or a small number of clients with particularly large accounts, you should try to customize their gifts as much as possible. Pay attention to each clients habits or get some information from the sales people who have dealt with them. For instance, if a client orders wine during dinner meetings, wine is a safe choice. If youve met with the client over golf, then a small token from their favorite course could be more appropriate. These personalized gifts can make your clients feel like theyre special and really important to your business. But if your business has too many clients for you to manage individual purchases, smaller more general items will do. Just avoid cheap promotional items like pens or notepads with your business logo. Even a handwritten card seems more genuine than these purely promotional items. You should also cater the timing of the gift giving to particular clients. Some clients, for instance, might not celebrate Christmas. You can ask clients if they do, without any specific questions about their religion or beliefs. But try to cater your gift giving to your clients preferences rather than your own. Alternatively, you might consider sending a gift to clients during another time of year. You could send a gift after the completion of a large project, a new product launch, or another type of milestone. But be sure to avoid sending gifts during inappropriate times. For instance, if youre currently trying to close an account with another company or are involved in a bidding war with a competitor, sending a gift could send the wrong message. Employees have come to expect at least a small token of appreciation from their employer at least once per year. This often takes place during the holiday season or at the end of the year, an annual by CareerBuilderexplains. Of course, most would prefer a simple cash bonus. So if thats a possibility for your company, dont forego it in favor of a token that only some employees might appreciate. If you cant afford sizeable bonuses for every employee, a small token like a restaurant gift card can still make them feel appreciated, . For most employees, you should stick to the same type of gift or at least gifts of similar value. But if you have one or two employees or colleagues who you work with more closely, like an assistant or partner, larger gifts may be more appropriate. The most important aspect of giving employee gifts is to remember every single person. Co-workers are likely to exchange information and you dont want anyone feeling under-appreciated or forgotten. Certain types of service providers for your business may also warrant holiday or end-of-year gifts. These can include virtual assistants, consultants, and even postal workers. You may choose to either send gifts to these service providers over the holidays (taking into account their preferences and habits, of course). Or you could send a gift after a big project or period of time where they went above and beyond to help your company. These service providers are also likely to prefer gifts like cash or gift cards. You can on an amount based on how closely you work with the person and what types of services they provide. But you can also personalize these gifts by adding a small token if appropriate. For instance, if you work closely with a virtual assistant and know his or her favorite type of candy or dessert, pair it with the cash or gift card. But you could be less likely to know the preferences of your postal worker, so cash inside a simple card may be a safer route. In addition, ask or find out if they have any restrictions on gifts. Postal workers, for example, are only supposed to receive gifts that are under $20 in value. So giving a larger tip or item could lead to an awkward situation for both parties.","Pssst. Dont tell anyone, but I must be one of the few people engaged in the social media and Internet marketing space who hasnt read Chris Brogan ( ) and Julien Smiths ( ) first best seller, . It was a Readers Choice for the , but I just didnt get to it at the time. Thats why I was very happy to receive a review copy of their newest book In the introduction to the book (and in several of their online interviews) Brogan and Smith say they never wanted to write a sequel to , but it seems like thats what their audience wanted. So, if youre one of those people who read and loved or who were left with a little something missing after reading  you will want to pick up a copy of . Id say that this is really a book about how to effectively communicate in todays world. Now that you have several solid years of social media under your belt, what would you say is missing for you? You might struggle with this question because youre overwhelmed by the mountains of online media channels and the myriad ways of how to use them effectively. Brogan and Smith did this work for you and decided that what was missing was  IMPACT. And to tie their concept together, they created the following equation that serves as the platform for the book: The authors are adamant that this book is NOT about social media  while being about communicating using social media. Its a tough distinction to get across and I have to admit, I was a bit confused at first. I think the analogy that cleared it up was this one: Ok  I think I get it now. is about CONTEXT and not about CONTENT. What they are trying desperately to get across is that you should be approaching your online communications from the context of making an impact  a difference in the world. The social media tools that they talk about throughout the book are really nothing more than vehicles to help you achieve your goal of making an impact instead of just noise. As I mentioned before, I had a bit of a challenge getting into the book. I started reading and felt somewhat overwhelmed by the content. I just didnt get where they were going with this at first. Thats when I turned to the table of contents and spent a little bit of time just digesting it. Id recommend you do the same. Youll notice that the book is divided into four parts: Brogan and Smith then broke up the Impact Equation into each of those parts: The section contains the introduction of working with the Impact Equation. This is where they introduce the concept and explain each element. In the section, they discuss Contrast and Articulation. In other words, Contrast and Articulation are what you have to do with your ideas. In order to accomplish this  you need a clear idea; one that can be contrasted and articulated via a variety of channels. My favorite section in the book was the one about . In this section, they discuss Reach and Exposure. Its my experience that people really struggle with platforms. And if you find yourself wondering which platform will help you achieve your goals, youll want to read this section more than once. Finally, they get into your . Inside this section, the authors get into what it takes to build on the Trust component and the Echo component of the Impact Equation. As much as they try to avoid getting into the details of social media tasks, you will find them there and I think that these examples and their advice only add to the relevance of the book. First of all, if youre a Chris Brogan and Julien Smith fan, youll want to read this book. It will give you all the things you love about them and then some. If you are an online publisher, blogger or small business that has social media and internet marketing as a core strategy, reading will help you to tighten up your message and your communication style online. I visited Chris Brogans Facebook page and my Facebook page (the personal ones) and I can definitely see the difference. Chris Facebook page not only features his personality and personal life, but seamlessly integrates his professional brand as well. One task Im taking on is to make my Facebook page posts more intentional, deliberate and purposeful as I move forward. As you read through the book, youll find yourself doing much of the same thing; reading, checking online, comparing and creating some new strategies for yourself. Small business owners who are still a bit confused or overwhelmed by the entire online and social media marketing space will benefit from reading . My only advice would be to not read a few pages and throw it down in disgust because youre not getting it right away. Give yourself time and space to process the information. Put it down for a day or two and pick it up again. I promise you will see the content differently. Overall, is slated to be one of those books you have to read if youre in the social media space. Ignore it, and youll likely feel left out the next time youre chatting Internet trends and social media.","is the latest in noise cancelling headphones from ONvocal.

Hosts Rebecca Greenfield and Francesca Levy take a close look at the way we live our lives at work -- our frustrations, dilemmas, habits, and anything else that happens in the office. Just about everyone has fantasized about quitting a job in grand style -- telling off a boss, for example, or tearing up a work nemesiss cubicle. Mostly, we hold the urge in check because we dont want to offend people from whom we might need stuff in the future. This week, Francesca and Rebecca tell a tale of bridge-burning that took place close to home. At a previous job, Rebecca very publicly insulted someone who later became an important figure in her work life. Did it hurt her career? She confronts the very man she insulted: This weeks guest, Bloombergs own Joe Weisenthal. SoundCloud: That Time I Burned a Bridge by Bloomberg    ","This guest column is by Anjli Jain ,Managing Partner at EVC Ventures. We are an early stage VC fund called EVC Ventures, and our portfolio companies approach us with a common problem a lot  we are scaling. We have need for people. Whom should we hire? How do we avoid the trap of hiring just for the sake of it and hire people we dont actually need? What follows below is a clearcut roadmap of the first few people you should be hiring that will form the core team along with the co-founders. Lets just highlight 2 key points here: What follows below is the hiring roadmap we advise our early stage portfolio startups A Salesman There is an everlasting debate about who matters more  the good salesman or the good developer? Lucky for you if you can get both of these dudes early enough. This is the era of the product and that may contribute to developers being overestimated  and hardly affordable. Here at EVC Ventures we firmly stand with the fact that the good salesman can help an early stage company lot more than the coder. The Lean startup movement made developers much beloved but they can often put your startup into a death spiral with their endless loops of iteration and feedback. The good salesman on the other hand has plenty of connections to trigger things up. He may seem old fashion for the product guy who is now taking feedback via webforms and various other mechanisms, however he can always pick up the phone in time of crisis  like calling the customer, getting a feedback, organizing a meetup, even pulling few strings for getting some extra survival dollars from his network. There is nothing as handy as having a good salesman onboard. Get yours quickly and remember the point I highlighted above about not hiring salesman from established corporations. Their need for manuals and procedures will kill you. UX specialist Design is 50% out of everything. Good design is what made the difference for Airbnb, Uber and plenty of others. A brilliant design decision to keep the Home page of Google.com with only one field and avoid the portal like appearance of Yahoo was Googles historical design driven move. It is notoriously hard to find a good UX specialist these days and she is worth every single penny. Good design can make your product sell on its own. Here at EVC Ventures the UX specialist is the 2nd guy or girl we advise our teams to find and we have dedicated sessions on how to recognize and hire a good UX designer. VP of Finance Not really a VP as we already highlighted before, but you get the point. This advice comes from Brad Feld an investor himself and founder of Feld technologies, which I completely approve. He advises that you should have your position of Finance filled up before you cross the number of 15 people in other to avoid further difficulties further in the process. The VP of finance should be entrusted with every login and password to every system in your company. You should let them interact directly with your investors. You should interact with them regularly, listen to them, but also manage them so they dont end up being the person that says no to everything. They should give you significant leverage in all aspects of your job, so you can spend more of your time focusing on your product and getting customers (or users). Disclaimer: This is a guestpost.

Image Credit:Entrepreneur","Whether youre an SEO consultant or event planner, youve probably considered incorporating your business at one time or another. The decision to incorporate brings several businesses, from asset protection and lower liability to easier access to business credit and capital. Choosing the right business structure is a weighty issue, one youll want to consider carefully from all angles. The S Corporation is a popular way for small businesses to optimize their tax treatment. And with the S Corp election deadline approaching (March 15 for existing corporations), its a good time to examine this business entity. The S Corporation actually begins as a general, for-profit C Corporation. After the corporation has been formed, it may elect S Corporation Status by filing Form 2553 with the IRS in a timely manner (more on the deadline below). With this S Corporation election, the company is now taxed as a sole proprietor or partnership rather than as a separate entity like the C Corp. This means that corporate profits and losses are passed-through and reported on the personal income tax returns of the shareholders. Thats why the S Corp is known as a pass-through entity. An S Corp is comprised of shareholders. Its members receive dividends allocated in accordance with the number of shares each holds. One of the greatest advantages of this business structure is that it allows profits to be distributed to owners in lieu of wages. This way, owners avoid paying separate federal taxes on company profits and personal wages. The best way to understand the S Corps impact on your taxes is to examine a few example cases. Of course, state and Federal tax rules vary, so its important to check with your accountant regarding your specific circumstances. Jeanie owns a graphic design business, which earned $100,000 in 2010. To keep things simple, lets assume the tax rates for individuals and corporations are 28 percent each. If her business was a regular C Corporation, the business would pay $28,000 in income taxes, and Jeanie would take home $72,000. Jeanie would then owe 28 percent personal income tax on this $72,000 dividend ($20,160). Overall, Jeanie is paying $48,160 in taxes for the year. This is whats called double taxation. Now lets say Jeanie had elected S Corp pass-through treatment for her business. As an S Corp, her business pays no income tax. The full $100,000 is distributed to Jeanie and she pays $28,000 on her personal income statement. Its pretty easy to see the benefit between $28,000 vs. $48,160 tax payments for the year. Although you are hoping forprofits, there may be years when your business sustains some losses as well. Like profits, losses must also be reported to the IRS. In this example, Frank quit his job as a plumber and opened a yoga studio in 2010. Since hes just starting out and had a lot of upfront costs, his yoga business ended up with a loss for the year. This loss could be passed through to Franks personal income statement, which helped him offset his other sources of income (i.e. the income from his plumbing job and stock profits). This helped him greatly reduce his personal tax liability for the year, and Frank was able to invest some of his refund into his yoga business. Charlie and Heidi open a chicken broth factory, each owning 50 percent of the business. Charlie is the investor and Heidi does all the work. Soon, the business is more profitable than they had ever imagined. Because Heidi has been working so hard, while Charlie has been on vacation for the past 8 months, they agree that Heidi should keep 75 percent of the profits and Charlie should get 25 percent. In an S Corporation, this arrangement would be a big problem. In an S Corporation, each owner/shareholder must share in the income in direct proportion to their ownership. Since Charlie and Heidi each own 50 percent, they will be allocated 50 percent of the corporations income (at least for the purpose of computing their personal income tax statements), regardless of any other agreements between the parties. An LLC (Limited Liability Company) would be better in this situation, as it is flexible when it comes to allocating income amongst the owners. Charlie and Heidi simply agree to the arrangement and they will be taxed accordingly. If you have an existing Corporation (C Corp) or LLC, March 15this your deadline for filing IRS Form 2553 with the IRS and electing S Corporation status for this tax year and forward.In other words, if your corporation/LLC existed on Jan 1, 2011, you need to file form 2553 by March 15, 2011 in order to have your S Corp in effect for the 2011 tax year. However, if you form a corporation or LLC on June 1, 2011, then your S Corporation deadline is August 15 (75 days from June 1). youll most likely be taxed as a C Corporation for the current tax year, and then your S Corp election will be effective for the following tax year. The IRS may give you a pass if you can show that your failure to file on time was due to reasonable cause. Of course, no one wants to be at the mercyof the IRS, so play it safe and get your form in on time. Your decision to incorporate will ultimately depend on all the unique aspects of your business. But regardless of your business type, taking a serious look at your legal structure is essential and is one of the easiest ways to save on your income taxes for years to come.","Shutterstock San Diego, California. In the market for a home? Mortgage site HSH.com has updated its estimate of how much annual income a household would need to buy a home in major metropolitan areas in the US, according to first-quarter 2016 data. The site highlights a few differences from last quarter: The Denver metro area has made a significant price surge - more so than any other analyzed Seattle is more affordable than the Washington DC metro area for the first time in the site's years of analysis The site looked at median home prices from the National Association of Realtors . It took into account interest rates for common 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and property taxes and insurance costs to figure out how much money it would take to pay a median-priced home's mortgage, taxes, and insurance in each city, and how much you'd have to earn to afford it. HSH.com emphasizes that this is only the base cost of owning a home - maintenance and other incidentals aren't included in its calculations. The site also calculated how it would change the salary needed to buy a home if a buyer were to put 10% down instead of the recommended 20%. No matter where you are, putting down less makes thingsmore expensive - you can visit HSH.com to see both numbers. Salaries are listed from lowest to highest needed, and are rounded to the nearest $500.","Good office printers are still a necessity no matter how mobile, cloud-based and digital businesses are getting. The problem, of course, is finding a reliable printing solution thats ready for your mobile needs. If youre on the road, getting connected to your office printer isnt always easy or feasible. Depending on the age of your printer, getting connected may literally require putting the rest of your day on hold, coming back to the office and plugging in physically. Meanwhile, with every use, your current printer is becoming older, less reliable and more obtrusive. So it may be time for a new office printing solution. And getting one thats adaptive to the way you do business today is essential. Thanks to devices like the that solution is getting more affordable, too. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8630 costs just $399.99. And when its purchased directly from HP, the company promises to include two full sets of black and color ink cartridges. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8630 is an all-in-one printer featuring a 4.3-inch touch-screen interface. It also sends and receives faxes, and even scans multiple pages of a document at once. While it may not be high-end enough to create stunning printed photos or graphics for your business, its certainly built to handle a steady workload from your office. HP claims the OfficeJet Pro 8630 has printing output speeds of 21 pages-per-minute for black-and-white and 16.5 pages-per-minute for color. The company also says that color prints from this device can save your business 50 percent of the cost of printing color documents from laser printers. For promotional materials like brochures, flyers, and posters, the printer features borderless and double-sided printing. However, based on our review, we found that color images dont come out as great as you might expect. As for its other features, the OfficeJet Pro 8630 can scan 14 documents per minute from a 50-page document feeder tray. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8630 makes an honest attempt at adapting to the needs of the mobile business. Wireless printing and the 4.3-inch touch screen interface are designed to allow you to connect to the printer from anywhere in your office or from wherever you may be out of the office. When youre in the office, the company says the printer lets you operate it remotely from a Near Field Communication-enabled smartphone or tablet. However, in our review we found that easier said than done. If youre away, the device lets you order printing via email, too. Just email a print job directly to your printer. It will be finished and waiting when you get back. The only thing you need to remember is to keep your printer full of paper. There are several cloud-based apps that allow you to easily print remotely from a smartphone or tablet too. HP ePrint, Apple AirPrint, and Android OS Enablement Printing all allow you to order print jobs remotely while on the road depending upon the kind of mobile device you use. The printer also uses your offices wireless connection to log onto the Web. There are specifically designed to be used with this printer. They allow you to do a variety of online printing jobs like print a schedule from your Google Calendar, for example. Among the main pros for this device is its printing speed, especially for an inkjet. At 21 pages per minute for black and white and 16.5 for color, the HP Officejet Pro 8630 performs better than some of HPs lower end printers of comparable quality. The HP Officejet Pro 8630 uses m0re durable inks, too. These pigment inks are more resistant to smudging, fading, spills and other marks. Its true the results cant compete with a laser printer, but for a standard inkjet printer, the results are impressive. And remember, cost per page is significantly lower with an inkjet rather thanlaser printer. So there may be considerable savings over time. On the negative side, some functions seem less than intuitive. For example, it was impossible to figure out the tap-to-print feature in our initial review. After hearing the feature talked up at numerous HP events, it was disappointing when it just wouldnt work. The tap to print feature is supposed to use Near Field Communications (NFC) technology to set up a print job remotely. But finding an app or explanation of how the feature works is the challenge. Although the HP pigment inks for this device provide better protection from smudges and spills, they also render images less impressively. While the device can produce decent simple documents, it will not replace a photo printer. So forget about printing off photos of your kids with this device . The HP Officejet Pro 8630 works best as a shared office printer for small or medium sized businesses. It will be great for those businesses that regularly printoffice documents like contracts. On the other hand, its probably not the right choice for a business that produces a lot of graphics in its documents like brochures or portfolios.","Acquisition and long-term loyalty are two sides of the same coin. Learn how CMO masterminds flip that coin to win their marketing bet every time when they leverage marketing-automation technology. Register here for free. A user-acquisition strategy is among the most important of any marketing strategy  and I believe strongly in a customer retention strategy as well, says Marissa Tarleton, CMO at RetailMeNot , which has nabbed a spot in the top five shopping apps in the country, with 45 million email subscribers and 19 million unique monthly visitors. The two tactics are not just effective in their own marketing silos, Tarleton explains. Because a repeat customer is cheaper than a new customer, driving loyalty and engagement means that the more loyal users are onboard, the more spend can be targeted toward driving engagement with the product and experiences to a broader audience. But at the same time, the word-of-mouth opportunity with a happy customer thats sharing regularly the success that theyve had with our product goes a long way, Tarleton adds. Loyalty can translate not only into efficiencies but into significant word of mouth and social opportunities with regards to happy customers. Both strategies start, she says, with the need for a deep understanding of your audience and their journey, as well as the devices theyre using, so that you can really understand the most personal and relevant way to acquire them. Relevance and personalization helps acquire customers that intend to be more loyal with you over time, versus just coming in and then abandoning. A lot of marketers are talking about personalization, but I mean it a little more deeply, Tarleton adds. I mean it cross-channel, cross-device, and cross-media. One common mistake in acquisition and personalization, Tarleton says, is that its not channel-specific. I wont name any by namebut Im solicited for clicks and app visits often from retailers that forget that theyve already sent me the same message in another format or vehicle within the last seven days, Tarleton says. Its fascinating how often that happens. You can quickly turn from Oh, you know me! to, Oh, you know me and youre not integrating your data to truly be relevant and now I dont like you. And right there, youve blown your cross-channel opportunity. The key to getting that right, Tarleton says, is using marketing automation to deliver that customer-retention and -engagement program. You have to put the customer first and build marketing automation plays around them, so that its seamless to a customer, agnostic to where and when theyre actually interacting with your brand, she explains. That cant be done without a pretty strong integrated data strategy that allows data to be exchanged across devices and across platforms. Its a critical mistake that I see retailers make, Tarleton says. They build data in silos without an integrated strategy and that can be a nonstarter when youre trying to do marketing automation.

Well, it could be because poor configuration of your mobile site is causing it to rank poorly with search engines. Thats right. A new study says up to 27 percent of mobile sites are not configured properly. And that could be costing you a huge amount of traffic, not to mention loss of revenue, because potential customers never even find the mobile version of your site. A recent research report(PDF) from SEO and marketing platform BrightEdge explains: But more alarming than the loss of traffic to your mobile site is the fact that mobile makes up an increasing amount of overall Web traffic. For example, Android and iPhone devices now account for an estimated 23 percent of organic traffic. And that share is expected to grow by 50 percent this year. Add to that, tablets now make up about 12 percent. Meaning, together mobile makes up almost a third of organic traffic today, the report concludes. Steps for improving traffic to your mobile site vary depending upon the configuration you are using: Lets look at the main problems the report identified for each of the three prominent types of mobile configuration: The separate URL configuration had, by far, the largest number of errors, the study concluded. The company says it gathered the data for the study using its Data Cube tool which collected over 100 terabytse of search related data from across the Web each week for analysis.","Starting a winery requires acres of land in the hills of Napa Valley. . .or so you may think. Entrepreneur Lysanne Tusar doesnt need excessive land or proximity to wine country to run her winery. In fact, she makes her wine on the third floor of a warehouse building in the middle of Hong Kong. The warehouse is located in Ap Lei Chau, an industrial district on Hong Kongs south side. The densely populated city, or any densely populated city for that matter, isnt exactly known for its wine production. But Tusar manages to make it work. She purchases flash-frozen grapes from the worlds most fertile regions, including Australia, France, and California. Then she turns those grapes into oak-aged wine within the walls of her 8,000-square-foot rental space. The wine from Tusars goes to local restaurants and bars, as well as to individual and corporate clients. But running a winery in an urban warehouse comes with some unusual challenges. Tusar recently lost half of her space due to increased rent. She had to cancel this years vintage and closed the winerys event business. Now she has half the space to work with and has considered closing or at least moving to a new location. Before the downsizing, 8th Estate Winery produced about 40,000 to 60,000 bottles of wine per year. And Tusar thinks that being Hong Kongs first vintage gave her an advantage over imported wine. She told the : And thats probably part of the reason shes hesitant to move the operation, even though her winemaking supplies are mobile. Making wine in an industrial warehouse building certainly isnt conventional. And only having 4,000 square feet to work with after losing half of her space cant be easy. But those differences do make her business interesting, and they could just be what sets her apart in a global marketplace full of wineries who all do it much differently than Tusar.","For a small business owner, displaying targeted Google ads on their website has become a powerful way to earn additional revenue. However, AdSense can go from best friend to complicated enemy pretty quick when SMBs start receiving notification their account has been suspended or banned due to reported click fraud. For those new to the AdSense world and who dont understand what click fraud is or how to correct it, these reports are incredibly frustrated and frightening. But relief is coming. First, if youre not familiar, the term click fraud refers to manufactured clicks designed to inflate an advertisers cost or a publishers earning. For example, if a publisher recruits his friends and family to repeatedly click on your ad on his site not because of interest, but to raise your costs, that would be deemed an example click fraud. There are many, many other ways click fraud can take place like the creation of click farms, automated tools, and other deceptive practices. This is the war Google is currently fighting. However, even Google realizes that sometimes click fraud isnt intentional. And as such, theyre announcing new ways of handling reports of click fraud to make the ecosystem more transparent and friendlier for us nice guys. The new policy was announced on the Google AdSense blog. In the post Google acknowledged that sometimes well-intentioned business owners find their accounts suspended and/or disabled for invalid activity without a clear understanding of why or how to fix it. Google said: To help good publishers, Google is announcing several changes. First, Google will now consider tenure more actively when responding to detected invalid activity so that trusted publishers will see suspensions, instead of terminated accounts. There is also a to submit more informative appeals. Google is also vowing to provide more details on invalid activitys causes. When invalid clicks are detected, Google will send out emails and notifications with more information and instructions to help publishers understand what is happening. Lastly, publishers can also take advantage of the expanded , as well as a new video series that explains why policies exist and how publishers can make sure theyre working inside of them. The first looks specifically at . For small business owners, the changes are designed to help you be a more informed AdSense customer and empower you to understand what is happening on your site or with your ads. Below are some additional AdSense best practices to keep in mind: is a great resource from Google designed to help you choose AdSense ad locations and formats for your website. If youre just getting started, this is a great way to learn how the pros do it and whats most successful. The maximum number of AdSense ads you can have on your website is three banner ads, three link ads, and two search box ads. Any more ads and Google will end up banning your account. And while youd think itd be hard to fit that many ads on your site to begin with, well, people try. When thinking about the number of ads on your site, realize that more ads isnt only a turn off for Google, its a turn off for users, as well. No one wants to land on a website and see it covered in ads. Find a balance that helps you earn additional revenue, without sacrificing the authority and professionalism of your site. Ads customized to the look and feel of your site will perform better than ads that do not look integrated. To integrate your ads, make the background and borders of your ads the same color as the background of your page where the ad will be placed.

As of yesterday, got a whole lot easier with the adoption of a bunch of new site features.    Heres a look at the best of whats new. One of the most useful parts of Facebook has always been the ability to control which members of your network have access to which information. For example,  you could set your filters so that your family and professional contacts were seeing different items and updates. LinkedIn has finally adopted this feature, giving users complete control over who sees which updates  whether its everyone, specific connections, a group you belong to or a specific user.    Depending on how you use your LinkedIn statuses, this can be a really powerful way to target individual pieces of content toward the right audience.  It gets rid of that firehouse effect that we often get trying to share information in social networking and ciphers directly into the group youre most interested in reaching.  This is a nice add from LinkedIn. Much of yesterdays announcement focused the new sharing options available to help promote content on the site.  If youre a regular Facebook user, many of the new additions will seem pretty intuitive. Mostly, because youve used them all before.  Some of the new adds include: LinkedIn says theyll also be making it easier to share content off-site and once again encourage the use of LinkedIns own URL shortener, lnkd.in. While the changes announced arent drastic, I think theyll do a nice job increasing the social feel of LinkedIn.  I think many SMB owners shy away from LinkedIn because they see it as the stuffier of the social networks, but these new features will help to change that.

You may think that all you need is a faster connection to speed up browsing, but it could be something as simple as downloading a better Web browser built for mobile. This review of the Dolphin browseris for the increasingly-mobile business owner who wants to be more productive and is looking for lifehacks to get there. Ill start out by saying that I love the on my Samsung S3 (courtesy of the fine folks at the no-contract cell phone team at Ting for Business who provided me with a long term loaner phone). I tried Chrome and other default browsers, but they were marginal at best. As a completely free browser, Dolphin delivers for Android, iPhone and iPad. You can even download extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Safari which will allow you to sync stuff with your mobile device. It is hard to take a photo of your phone when thats your only camera. So Im using a press kit photo from the companys website. : : If you are on a mobile phone and find yourself waiting for websites to load, test out a different browser like Dolphin. Again, it is a free browser and you can get it for your Android-powered phone, the iPhone and iPad.","Visual marketing is one of those buzz terms circulating a lot lately. With the way the Internet itself has changed over time, that is to be expected. Users have a certain expectation that you have to meet, and a lot of it has to do with the visuals associated with the content you create. You are trying to engage people around the world with a universal language, one done through images rather than the standards of text. Able to evoke emotional responses and long lasting associations, visual marketing is a crucial element to any strategy in branding today. Failing to meet this standard could be disastrous, and possibly lead to a lot of work with no payoff. Isnt that every companys nightmare? Visual marketing can be broken down into five pillars, and knowing them will help you to establish a better plan to increase visibility and generate brand loyalty. A lot of people will make the mistake of sticking with one form of media over others. There is nothing wrong with having your primary content be a specific type, but you should still try and add in others on a regular basis. I usually suggest a 1/5 ratio. If you are posting five photos with funny captions, remove one of the pictures and add in a video instead. While you might be sharing , make one of them an actual infographic. This also applies to shared content versus original content. Try to make as much as possible original, rather than all shared. And instead of making it all original, add in a few things you have found around the Web to connect with other sources. Just make sure people know where it originally came from. Content re-packaging is one of the most to create different media types based on one research. An occasional off-topic tangent or item is fine. But most of what you present should be relevant to your brand, even if that connection isnt very strong. Some kind of link should exist, otherwise you are diluting the message you are trying to get across. If you are posting something completely off the subject, try to find a way to link it up to your brand. For example, a picture of a smiling pig might not have anything to do with a sale your site is holding. But adding a caption where the pig is expressing its excitement about getting 40% off of all merchandise does. You will find you can stretch things pretty far to find relevance. Certain platforms are better for different forms of media, and you should optimize to match their strengths: Remember to take advantage of different features each platform has, like , proper categorization, enticing titles, etc Most platforms will be good for more than one purpose, or the same purpose across sites. Cross promotion is a good way to get the same visuals seen on a larger scale and to increase your pool of who sees it. Sites like Twitter and Pinterest are more open natured, so you should definitely post any Facebook content on those pages as well. Or adapt visual content into other media formats in order to cross promote it further, like turning an infographic tutorial into a video for YouTube. Part of marketing is getting others to get the word out for you. This can be encouraged by making it extra easy to share content. Have plenty of social media buttons on your website so it can be posted anywhere. Smartly double post things on your social profiles, such as cycling the same content after a couple of days so more people can see and share it. Ask for a like or share on Facebook if they agree or disagree. Include people to ensure they see they are meant to be a part of the conversation. Visual marketing is kind of like the industrys new toy. People are only beginning to really understand and implement it and, as the buzz increases, it is becoming more crucial than ever to get on board. With the Internet more visual than it has ever been before, failing to properly provide such enhancements and engagement is a quick way to lose yourself a lot of visibility on an already saturated market. There are many of them out there that you can use for free, and these are ten of the best (in my opinion): The best colors are found in real life. Nature photos, the color of someones eyes, the fabrics of a woven blanketthey hold associations in our minds. But they arent always easy to break down, and finding the name or code of a color can seem impossible.

A product by popular note gathering application Evernote, Skitch works by allowing you to use fewer words by creating sketches and annotations. This promotes visual content above traditional content, and makes it easy to use. Draw attention to certain points, show instead of tell and share it across the Web. Infographics are sort of the ultimate visual marketing tool right now. People love them, and sites like Pinterest are especially aimed at letting you share them. But not everyone has the time or even skill for making infographics on their own. Piktochat streamlines the process and gives anyone everything they need to get it done. Marketing specialists are using it all the time, as it helps to get the point across more efficiently. Find gorgeous and unique color schemes based on photos of nature scenes.

On the other side of the table, hiring managers across industry verticals say job-ready talent is in short supply in India. In 2011-12, the by the Ministry of Human Resource Development estimated that there were 28.56 million students enrolled in higher education. The number has increased since then, but hiring managers everywhere will tell you that while graduates have theoretical knowledge, they lack practical experience, specific skills, and communication skills For instance, a found that 97 percent of engineering graduates do not possess the English skills required for high-end jobs. In the IT space, companies have little choice but to train these graduates from scratch in the latest technologies. The chasm between trained talent and industry requirements is wide, and an expensive one to bridge. With few institutions equipped to teach industry-relevant skills, young employees wanting to move up have had to resort to neighbourhood institutes offering crash courses, take short-term courses in colleges, or try out the relatively recent option of an online course. Small institutes often make promises they cannot keep and stick to the basics. Colleges are rarely able to offer practical courses on the latest technologies because of the time it takes for a formal course to be developed and deployed. Online courses come with the risk of a high dropout rate because the flexibility of self-paced learning often leads to a lack of discipline, culminating in a high dropout rate. So is there another option that offers real challenges to develop real skills? MOOCs do. Massive open online courses, or MOOCs as theyre popularly known, have been around for several years now. Several of these feature courses from the worlds best universities, including Ivy League schools in the US, and in a variety of languages. Browsing through the long list of courses available on MOOC providers like Coursera and edX can be a mindboggling experience. Other providers, though, are focused on select areas. Udacity, for instance, specializes in technology, though it does have a limited number of non-tech courses too. It also doesnt offer courses from universities; instead, Udacity partners with industry bigwigs  its Android Developer curriculum, for instance, is developed by industry practitioners at Google. According to s list of 50 most-popular free online courses available in English, the most popular was Learning How to Learn from UC San Diego, reflecting that the thirst to learn runs deep the world over. Tellingly enough, the most popular courses at MOOCs are the ones that promise to give learners real skills. Even so, hiring managers do wonder if you have real skills, as opposed to knowledge, even if you have completed a long and arduous course. Says a senior hiring manager at a Bangalore-based IT firm on condition of anonymity: A couple of years back, I hired an engineer who had completed a full specialization through such a course. His CV and work experience were great and I took a risk. It didnt work. He knew what he had to do, but he couldnt actually do it. After that, I preferred to go back to Well, thats actually the wrong question to ask. If youre looking to learn real skills, beyond the certification, these are the questions you cant afford to skip. Are you looking for knowledge or skills or both? Some courses cover only theory. Others cover theory and some application while several technology-based courses are entirely driven by learning and experimenting (with a clear assessment and feedback mechanism built into the process). Review the course structure to make sure it focuses on what you need. Scan the learning objectives of the course, as well as the teaching methods (types of lectures, assignments, etc.). A video lecture full of animation doesnt necessarily mean its superior learning content. Understand the scope. An introductory course is not going to give you all the practical skills you need. For some courses, a multiple choice format may be able to evaluate your learning properly. Application-oriented courses like ones teaching programming must have real coding assignments and projects that require you to apply your learnings. Then, if your work is being evaluated by a fellow learner, the feedback you get will differ greatly from one reviewer to the next as their own levels of expertise are varied. If your code isnt assessed by someone whos an expert at it, or if your reviewer cant provide you constructive feedback, then you may not be able to acquire the depth of skills you need. This is important because when you are not in a classroom setting and interacting with your peers, keeping up your levels of self-discipline and motivation to learn can be difficult. Its why the dropout rate for MOOCs is so high. People lose interest, or they dont learn and therefore leave. Most MOOC providers do have student groups and forums where they can interact about anything related to the course. Online discussion forums are full of evaluations of specific online courses, their pros and cons. Whats more, there are many who have completed similar courses from various providers and provide a detailed comparison on the learning experience, assignments and projects. The bottom line is simple: any course you do must equip you with the skills you need to move ahead in your career and do work that is satisfying. And thats what hiring managers everywhere are looking for  proven skills to solve real problems. Are you ready to upskill?","Four years ago Dr. Scott Shane a presentation he had made at a workshop at Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland on trends in the venture capital industry. In the intervening period, a number of people have asked for updated slides. The updated venture capital trends slides are now available.This article will highlight key venture capital trends. Acquisitions have accounted for more than 80% of venture capital exits since 2001, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association. See slide above. Today, venture capitalists dont look to the public markets nearly as much to exit. Venture capital backed IPOs have been scarce since the year 2000. And when exits do occur via IPOs, the median age of their portfolio companies has gone up  its now six years old. The trend away from IPOs is illustrated by this chart showing thatIPOs as a percent of VC investments five years prior, havefallen significantly: By a number of measures, the venture capital industry is shrinking. Capital under management by VCs has trended down since the year 2000. The number of active venture capital funds and firms raising money has plateaued, also.  And the number of companies getting venture capital funding has stayed flat, at somewhere between 1,000 and 1,5000 annually. Thats less than half the number getting venture funding at the height of the Dot Com era, in 2000. At the same time, corporate venture capital (i.e., corporations with venture arms) in ticking up modestly. VC firms are showing a distinct move away from early stage (i.e., seed and start-up) deals. In 2013, early stage deals made up just a little over 5% of venture deals. Twenty years ago early stage companies made up almost 25% of the total number of deals. Follow on deals are not growing in size. And the initial deal size is shrinking ininflation-adjusted terms. Venture capital is important for building highgrowth companies. There is no goodsubstitute for venture capital. Angel investments are too small and early. Lenders and banks cannot earn appropriate returns and still adhere to usury laws. And the crowdfunding market is too small. Without venture capital, there may be fewer innovative new firms. .","For anyone whos tried to compose anything more complex than a text message on your smartphone, have we got news for you.

The company is this smartphones larger and more vivid screen size, its durability, and high-powered camera as the devices more impressive features. The Sony Xperia Z3 is Sonys closest answer to a phablet today. The flagship smartphone for the company has a 5.2-inch full HD 1080p display and a 20.7 megapixel rear-mounted camera. Sony says its trademarked TRILUMINOS display for mobile with Live Colour LED and X-Reality (a way to process images for a higher quality look), is supposed to make the Xperia Z3 ideal for watching videos or viewing the screen in bright light or outdoor settings. Sony says the rear-mounted camera is capable of operating well in those conditions, too. The rear-mounted camera has a 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS for mobile image sensor and a new 25mm G Lens. That lens allows the camera to shoot wider angle photos and video to get more into every shot. Though Sony mostly touts the entertainment features of the Sony Xperia Z3, the camera and video recorder abilities along with some advanced internal specs suggest it should serve adequately as a business device, even for those who work outside or in harsher conditions. The smartphone comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with a 2.5 GHz quad-core CPU. The phone has a 4G LTE modem for fast mobile browsing. T-Mobile has announced that it will add the Sony Xperia Z3 to its supported phone lineup this Fall, according to a from the mobile carrier. The smartphone uses that hardware to operate Android 4.4 KitKat. The is sold standard with 3GB of RAM and up to 16GB of flash memory. A microSD card slot can expand memory up to 128GB. The battery on the Sony Xperia Z3 can reportedly last for 19 hours of talk time or about 10 hours of video playback, according to Sony. The phone is also Near Field Communication enabled, which opens the possibility of mobile payment functionality. Sony also says that the new device is dust proof and waterproof. That includes the ability to snap photos under water, like in a pool. Sony Xperia Z3 can stay under 1.5 meters of water for up to a half-hour.","The developed world wastes almost as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces in a given year, according to the United Nations. This means theres an opportunity for sustainable startups to try and make use of all that food waste. And there are already a few companies using technology to make that vision a reality. is one of those startups. The company runs an app that connects American food companies and transporters with food banks and similar charities. Restaurants, shipping companies, and other food producers can tell the Food Cowboy app what items they have available. Food Cowboy then sorts through the data and sends notifications via text and/or email to local charities that might be able to receive the items. The receiving charities pay Food Cowboy 10 cents per pound of food, which is about a third of what food banks normally pay for such items. And the companies that supply the food can receive tax deductions for their donations. Food waste isnt exactly a new problem in countries like the U.S. But technology does offer a new opportunity to make use of food items in a timely manner. Roger Gordon, president of Food Cowboy, Economist: In other words, restaurant owners dont have a lot of time to search around for charities to take their would-be food waste and deliver it to them. Likewise, many food banks dont have the time or resources to drive around picking up donations from businesses. So Food Cowboy provides the link that connects the two, and makes it easier for all parties involved to make use of food waste. Food Cowboy isnt the only company making use of technology to reduce food waste. is a California startup that serves as a sort of Craigslist service for excess food. Other tech-centric efforts are popping up around the rest of the country and the world as well. So far, theres not one widely used solution for this problem. It could take awhile for any of them to really catch on. But technology has certainly increased the possibilities for solving the food waste problem. And more and more startups are using innovative ideas to solve it.","Shame on me.  I must have been the only person that had not heard of Gary Vaynerchuk until Dan Schawbel wrote about him in his issue of .   Then, during a business trip to New Jersey, I had the chance to stop in at the Wine Library and actually experience what I had only seen on .  Then I started looking into the best books of 2009 for and ordered   for review. I had heard mixed reviews on the book.  Some people felt that it was overly simplistic and shallow and others  (like the readers who voted it as one of the of 2009) felt that it was outstanding.  So Im going to see for myself. Id recommend learning a couple of things about Gary Vaynerchuk BEFORE you read the book.   It will give you a little perspective and context from which to get the most out of the book. Garys parents are Russian immigrants who owned a liquor store.  As a teenager, Gary worked behind the counter.  To combat boredom, he started reading Wine Spectator.  Since he was too young to train his palette on the wine, he decided to study all the different flavors associated with wine.  This included obscure fruits and vegetables, grass, dirt, rocks, tobacco and wood. As a college student, he started re-branding the business as Wine Library and establishing himself as an expert.   One of the things that really aggravated him was the stuffiness and snobbery from traditional wine sommeliers.   Its this pet peeve, paired with his zest for wine, business and the internet that make Gary an interesting case study in personal branding and entrepreneurship. Gary reminds me a little of Tim Ferris (author of the ) and Mike Michalowicz (author of ).  Hes young, confident, entrepreneurial and a little in-your-face.  In fact, I can understand why his style might seem sophomoric to some readers.  Let me just say Ive never spoken with Gary (but Id love to) and Im wondering if the book disappointed some readers because hes and he makes it all seem so effortless and fun.  He truly believes that EVERYONE deserves to love what they do and be so passionate about it that they cant help but be successful. While I completely believe in this  and share that philosophy on many levels, I realize that there are some individuals who are truly gifted and inspired entrepreneurs.  Gary has that magical mix of passion, well earned expertise and tireless enthusiasm and creativity  that not all of us can muster consistently.  And this is where you might find helpful. If one of your goals this year was to get over the economic doldrums of 2009, then this is a great way to start your year.   is an easy short read.  There are no confusing or convoluted concepts here.   In fact, if youre a seasoned business owner, you might be one of those people who would find it simplistic and boring.  And I get that.  But I would also like to say that I found good nuggets in here; things that you know that you should be doing, but have found excuses NOT to do.  Reading them here will get you inspired to move forward. Here are just some of the topics I found interesting: I like this little bit on page 88 about hustle.  Gary tells it like it is regarding how much effort and energy it takes to build a brand and a business  even when you are a gifted entrepreneur and are good at what you do AND know how to use the internet and social media.  It doesnt come easy.  Thats why its important to love what you do. The good stuff starts in chapter 10.  There is a wonderful to do list on here that includes: These are all beyond basics.  Ive done some, but I havent done them all.  How about YOU? In fact, the whole book is really nothing more than basic tips, how-tos, resources and examples that you may have already heard of, but may have never taken full advantage of.  The benefit of reading Crush It!  is in having a current case study of what one entrepreneur did to build his brand equity. If youre looking for some wildly intellectual, deeply insightful or philosophical business strategy, you may not enjoy this book.  This book isnt academic.  Its practical and straightforward.  Crush It! comes straight from Gary Vaynerchuks soul.  If youve heard of Gary and wanted to learn about what made him tick  you will . But, the best reason to read this book is because its fun, inspiring and full of great ideas and resources.  If all you do is choose one idea to implement each month  you will be further ahead in building your brand and increasing sales.",", the freemium website building platform, announced its new ShoutOut feature today, a way to send out beautiful newsletters and updates about your business.

Go to an airport, and it seems like everybody waiting for a plane is looking at a phone. Even when it would be a breach of business etiquette to look at your phone, such as in meetings or at conferences, many of us find it hard to resist pulling the phone out and sneaking a peek to check messages or Twitter updates. But now you dont need to pull out your phone. Instead, you might just casually glance at your wristwatch  your Pebble smartwatch, that is. developed by Pebble Technology. Its development was funded via Kickstarter, where it raised a record $10 million. Pebbles smartwatch started shipping to its backers in early 2013, and has been available for sale on the Pebble website. Now it is about to hit retail stores. The , for $149. Other colors, including white and orange, will still only be available at the Pebble website for now. Pebble doesnt replace your smartphone, but instead works with it. Pebble connects to your iPhone or Android device via Bluetooth. You download the Pebble app onto your phone. Then information is transmitted to the watchface. For instance, you can check emails on it, or caller ID to see whos calling you. You can access Twitter and Facebook updates with it. You can also customize the watchfaces. Pebble uses outdoor-readable electronic-paper (e-paper) displays. The watchface is customized using software apps  you can make it look like various versions of a traditional watch with a dial, and hour, minute and second hands. Or you can make it look like a digital readout. Pebble is not the first smartwatch to be invented. that works with some Android devices. But Pebble is the first one that has captured wide interest among the public. More importantly, Pebble has a growing community of third party developers extending its functionality through apps. When the Pebble was first shipped to Kickstarter backers in March of this year, one of the complaints was that it was fairly limited in the kinds of ways you could use it. But in the few months since then, third party developers have been developing apps to extend the usefulness of the Pebble smartwatch. Pebble actively encourages third party developers. Pebble is great for sports and hobbies. how if youre a cyclist, runner or golfer you can use Pebble as a bike computer, accessing the GPS on your smartphone to display speed, distance and pace data. But we see the potential for using Pebble for business. As a business owner you can use Pebble to stay on top of things with notifications, messages and alerts. For instance, you can pair up Pebble to give notifications you set up with notification recipes through IFTTT.com. You can even dismiss a notification with a shake of your wrist. Disabling all notifications is simple as well. Here are just some of the notifications your Pebble natively gives you: Apps and native support for certain tasks vary based on whether youre using it with an Android device or an iPhone. Be sure to check for availability of specific functions on the phone platform of your choice. Each week more third party apps are being developed to further customize and extend the usefulness of the smartwatch. You can be notified when your next meeting is going to begin. Or what time the next bus or train is so that you wont be late even if you are engrossed in work. If youd like a quick power nap between meetings then check-in on your watch, or create an app that can monitor your sleep. You can even use this feature to monitor time taken to complete tasks like replying to emails, writing reports and printing them. Want to play some music to give an interesting twist to a presentation? You can use the music control app to play, pause or skip tracks on your phone with the touch of a button. Theres a lot of potential. While the mobile device category of the smartwatch is still young, it holds promise.

Too many lawyers, chasing not enough work, and pressure from clients to provide discounts have become a fact of life in the current market. In fact, because of the high unemployment, law school applications are on pace to hit a . Since the recession, the fraction of new J.D.s finding a full-time job requiring a state bar license dropped from 74 percent down to less than 60 percent, according to by the National Association for Legal Placement. Now to be fair, this is not to say that ALL firms are sinking.Quite the contrary. Still, the legal sector is undergoing major changes. And these changes are HUGE lessons for the smart business owner. So what can small business owners learn?Namely: President Obama recently issued an executive order designed to get the government and private companies working more closely to protect the nation against cyber attacks. Cyber attacks on U.S. businesses have increased dramatically as hackers look to steal financial and intellectual assets from computer systems. The smartest cyber criminals have even figured out that the best way to get what they want is to avoid the target corporation entirely and . According to Mary Galligan, special agent in charge of cybersecurity for the FBI: Why? Well, the truth is, most law firms .Most small businesses look at their business and say, Im small. No one wants to attack little ole me. Because of the recession, many clients are fed up with the billable hour. Many experts agree the system itself is fundamentally flawed. Why? Some law firms are starting to see .According to Kyle Westaway, a social enterprise attorney: Its a smart move considering the amount of LPOs and other alternative legal service providers taking away clients.Your customers are smarter than theyve ever been. Be real with them, be transparent and be accountable. Theyll reward you for it. Some law firms are outraged that LPOs are taking away clients- even major U.S. law firms are scrambling. While most are outraged there are a few firms that are actually to win businesses. One Washington, D.C. firm is bringing in LPO representatives to pitch meetings to demonstrate how it can do the work at lower costs than other traditional firms. Smart. Truly smart business owners understand the power of strategic partnership. If the cost sharing and economies of scale work, if theres up-selling or cross-selling potential, if both products or services complement each other and if there is a good non-disclosure and non-compete agreement in place  why not turn your foe into a partner? If you cant beat em. . . In , it was found that most in the legal sector are slow to implement succession plans. Unfortunately, without that transition in place, firms could face expertise gaps and ultimately could lose clients. This is even more significant as the study points out, 30 percent to 40 percent of practicing lawyers in the U.S. and Canada are starting to retire. Succession planning often takes a backseat to the daily operations and hassles of running the business. How much of a backseat? According to a global survey of 1,300 companies by Korn/Ferry, though 98 percent of companies believe a CEO succession plan to be important, . And 49 percent havent had one in place for the last three years. Yikes. Dont make the mistake of waiting too long.

A hashtag is a label for content. It helps others who are interested in a certain topic, quickly find content on that same topic. A hashtag looks something like this: #MarathonBombings or . Hashtags are used mostly on social media sites. They rocketed to fame on Twitter. But now you can use hashtags on other social platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest and Google+. Anyone sharing content on a relevant topic can add the hashtag label to their message. Others searching for that topic, can search for that label to find other messages on that same social media platform. For example, during the horrific Boston Marathon bombings in the spring of 2013, several hashtags were used. They proved invaluable for providing and following up-to-the-minute news about the bombings. In fact, several big news stories in recent years have been amplified and added to with citizen reports and amateur video and photographs. Hashtags for such situations also provide a way for the public to express their sentiment  something many of us feel compelled to do in the case of a disaster. When it comes to natural disasters, a hashtag is like an information lifeline. We cling to it, to learn more about the event and provide an emotional outlet. Hashtags, however, are not limited to big news stories. Small business marketers have also cracked the code and figured out inventive ways to use hashtags. Well discuss the marketing uses of hastags more below. But first, lets talk about some nuts and bolts to understand hashtags better. Hashtags are simple things. There are just a few technical requirements to know: A hashtag can be a single word, an abbreviation, an invented combination of letters and numbers, or a phrase. If it is a phrase, there can be no spaces between words. All letters and numbers must run together without spaces in a hashtag. You cant have punctuation or symbols in your hashtag (other than the # symbol at the beginning). Numbers are OK, but you must also have at least one letter with the numbers  hashtags cannot consist entirely of numbers. A hashtag always starts with the symbol # followed directly by letters and sometimes numbers. Fun factoid: depending on where you are in the world, the symbol # is called various things. In the United States and Canada, it is called anumber sign or sometimes a pound sign. But in other places, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, that # symbol is called a hash sign. So you see, thats how these labels came to be called hashtags. In essence, a hashtag is a label that consists of a word or phrase with a symbol in front of it. Anyone can create a hashtag. Ive created numerous hashtags over the years. You could create one of your own or several, if you wish. All you do to create a hashtag is think it up. Then start using it in your messages. Usually you add it to the end of messages. But you could add it anywhere in the message that makes sense, as long as its readable. You are not required to register a hashtag anywhere. There are some hashtag directories around, but they unofficial, outdated and usually not worth the trouble. If you think youve invented a hashtag thats completely new, do a search first on the social platform you intend to use it on. We find that about 25% of the time, the hashtag we want to use is already being used for some other purpose. Now, theres no hashtag police. So technically, theres nothing stopping you from using a hashtag already in use. But doing so will cause confusion, or worse, be seen as an attempt to hijack a discussion just to gain attention. If the hashtag you want is in use, its best to go back to the drawing board. Dont forget to check usernames, too. Make sure your intended hashtag is not the same as an existing username on a social network. Here again, it may cause confusion to use a hashtag such as #DellSMB if there is a user @DellSMB. Besides, the user probably would interpret it as an attempt to hijack their brand name. You could find yourself on the receiving end of a cease-and-desist letter, or with the social platform taking action for violating someones trademarked name, if the issue is taken to extremes. One exception to the uniqueness concept: some people use general topics as hashtags, such #Marketing or #Sales. We discuss the use of general topics below  in essence no one owns a general topic hashtag. Keep hashtags as short as possible. Thats especially important for Twitter where you have a limited character count. Its best if a hashtag is an understandable word, phrase or abbreviation. Hashtags that are long, hard to pronounce or hard to remember, will be hard for people to use, too. You cant go wrong with something short and easy to remember. On Google+, you get an added benefit: Googles technology will automatically assign a hashtag to your content, without you doing anything. You can tell it not to add the hashtag, if you prefer, so you can manually add your own hashtags. Rather than creating your own hashtag, sometimes you want to enter a discussion around a topic where a hashtag already exists. You would simply add that hashtag somewhere (usually at the end) of your Twitter tweet or other social media update. By doing so, you are sharing your content related to that same topic. By adding the hashtag to your content, you are saying Hey, I want to chime in on this discussion. Others interested in that topic will see your content. Avoid hashtag pollution. This is using multiple hashtags in a single message. Any more than two hashtags in a message makes it difficult to read. Its considered bad etiquette to add a hashtag to an unrelated message just to get attention. Always make sure your content is relevant to the hashtag you use. Otherwise, people may report you for being a spammer, or respond testily. There are as many ways to use hashtags for your business as creative people can think up. Here are 7 ways small businesses use hashtags, either their own, or hashtags started by others  and most can be done on a very small budget or for free: You can hold a contest and use a hashtag to get people to enter your contest and gain followers on your Twitter account, too. Be careful on Facebook, as Facebook has certain strict rules about running contests. But its easy on Twitter. Heres an example: The #FollowFriday (or #FF for short)hashtag is a simple way to network with others. On Fridays, you give a shout out to people whose tweets you find helpful. This is a key way that followers get our attention, and were likely to follow them back. Heres an example: Text chats are held on Twitter. Since Twitter is just one big open platform, you have to have some way of designating who is participating in the chat. Otherwise, you have no way of knowing whether a tweet is responding to something someone else said in the chat, or not. Thats where a hashtag is useful. Assign a unique hashtag, everyone uses it, and voila  you are hosting a discussion, albeit a text discussion. Dont want to organize your own chat? Then participate in a standing chat. Try # on Wednesdays, from 8 to 9 pm Eastern time, with host Melinda Emerson. Read: . Most conferences and business events these days have a dedicated hashtag assigned for the event. An easy way to find out who else is there and connect with them in person, is to check the Twitter stream for the hashtag. See who tweets, and then send a direct message to that person, to set up a time to connect. You can find valuable business content through Twitter, by checking hashtags for general topics such as #Marketing or #SmallBiz. Want your content to spread further? Use such hashtags when sharing your own content, and maximize who can see your content. You can do something similar on other social platforms, such as Pinterest. Lets say you sell food products, such as your own line of BBQ sauces. You could use the #BBQ hashtag on Pinterest to share photos of recipes using your product, and to connect with others who like barbeque. For the Small Business Influencer Awards, we use the hashtag #SMBinfluencer. Its a way to develop energy and excitement around the Awards, and for us as the Award organizers to track discussion around it. Nominees use it to see the discussion other nominees engage in and share with their communities. See how others are using hashtags. is a service that aggregates hashtags, and tells you what people are discussing. Its bound to give you ideas. And dont forget to check out . We also have a good meaty discussion on and how to avoid getting yours hijacked for negative publicity. How do you use hashtags in your business?

And the even more head-scratching news is that Google is now selling Motorola to Lenovo for almost $10 billion less than what it paid. Google and is now selling it for $2.91 billion. But as you look closer, it may be a better deal for Google than it seems  and a good deal for Lenovo. As part of the deal, Google will retain ownership of Motorola Mobilitys patent portfolio. Lenovo will be granted a license to these patents and other intellectual property still owned by Google after the sale. Lenovo will get 2,000 patent assets and the Motorola Mobility brand and trademark portfolio, Google and Lenovo in a joint statement. By acquiring Motorola Mobility, Lenovo enters the North and Latin American smartphone markets wit a strong brand. Both companies Motorola Mobility is the third largest company in those markets already. Lenovo hopes Motorola will help the company establish itself in the Western European smartphone market too. In a prepared statement, Lenovo chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing said: For Google this means a boost in the number of phones using the companys Android operating system on the market. Google CEO Larry Page says selling Motorola to Lenovo allows his company to focus on developing the Android mobile operating system. And as Quartz :","Last week both Facebook and Yelp announced theyd soon be offering deals to customers who check in at a particular location. Good idea, right? FourSquare sure thought so when they launched it months ago. On the Yelp blog, Luther Lowe didnt give specifics but hinted that the review site would soon offer Yelp to help further bridge online discovery and online buying. According to the blog post, Check-In Offers will be different from Sales and Special Offers and will give users discounts when they check in to locations. As ReadWriteWeb stated last week, the check in feature does . Yelp has always been a site dedicated to local discovery and matching users with SMBs. This seems like a very natural extension of that. While Luther didnt offer many details, this will be a nice addition to the site. But Yelp wasnt the only company to announced check in offers last week; . Facebook took the stage last week to announce to its mobile platform. They announced new features like Facebook Groups for Mobile, a Facebook Places API, Single Sign-In to sign into other sites with one click, Facebook Places for the iPhone, etc. However, none of what they announced rocked the blogosphere more than the announcement of . Facebook Deals is exactly what it sounds like  a new service that will allow SMB owners to offer their customers special deals when they check in to their business on Facebook. According to Facebook, Deals will come in four different flavors: Facebook already has more than 20 major brands signed up to offer deals, including 24 Hour Fitness, American Eagle, Gap, JCPenney, Macys and Starbucks. And were not just talking about offering a free cup of coffee or pastry either. Some of these deals are surprisingly enticing. For example, Gap will give a free pair of jeans to the first 10,000 customers to claim the deal, and the San Francisco 49ers will offer 200 fans tickets for just $49. When you combine the quality of the deals with the brands behind them and Facebooks active 200 million mobile users a month, the power of Facebook Deals become quite evident. While FourSquare and Groupon have had a hard time attracting mainstream users, Facebook has already captured these folks. That gives them a great advantage in the mobile space. Once the program is rolled out, business owners will be able to easily create Facebook Deals from a single screen. Business listings that include a deal will be given a yellow marker on the Nearby Places page to signify that a deal exists and encourage users to click through and check it out. To view the deal, users must pull up the Facebook Place page, where they can then claim it. Business owners who take part in Facebook Deals will be able to see how many people have claimed a specific deal vs. how many people have checked into their business. They wont be able to tie the check-in to a specific user, just like they cant see which user clicked on a Facebook ad. If youre a small business owner, Yelp Check-In Offers and Facebook Deals are definitely programs youll want to take a look at. Discounts and coupons have time and time again proven to be one of the leading reasons that social media users interact with brands online. By pairing an enticing deal with a relevant audience, theres a huge opportunity. Were still waiting for further information from Yelp about Check-In Offers, but you can find out more about Facebook Deals .","This years National Business Etiquette Week runs from June 7 to 11at The Protocol School ofWashington.

If youre hungry, there is . If you have a party to turn to and cant find anything to wear, there is and to the rescue. And provides, well, housing.  India is seeing a growth phase under the leadership of able people. However, there still exist many challenges that need to be addressed. To solve these challenges and problems, the country as a whole must be engaged, and talent must be brought from outside the government domain, especially where domain knowledge or entrepreneurial leadership is required. People who are passionate create great things, and companies that aspire to solve bigger problems do much better than those who just look around for funding and money. A combination of talent and diverse experiences backed by strong political will are the key ingredients to coming up with out-of-the-box solutions to address the many challenges we face as a developing country. We look at some of the real issues in India that startups can aim to address. One of the most critical needs today is access to good healthcare. Billions around the world, particularly people in the Indian subcontinent, struggle because they do not get proper access to healthcare. Even those with access have a sour experience. We have apps that let us book movie tickets and seats in a jiffy or even find that perfect restaurant! However, finding doctors is still unbelievably tough. Patient records are either maintained in fat files or if they are online, they are often not accessible or understandable. Doctors do not usually have the time to go through all the reports and this may lead to a compromise on the health front. Health-based startups can address a lot of issues plaguing instant access to healthcare in India. Healthcare is undergoing a major change and smartphones will soon replace doctors for more than 80 percent of health-related problems! In India, the pains of a city's chaotic public transport system, public trains and metros operating well beyond their capacity, and a limited taxi service, are some of the roadblocks to an efficient public transport system. State-sponsored mass transit systems are unable to keep pace with people, private enterprises haven't been able to do enough, and dated regulations have not allowed them to do enough to try to fill the breach. Private car ownership has exploded and so has the surge of taxi majors like Ola (in 102 cities with 20,000 vehicles on its platform) and Uber (announcing billions investment to expand in India). The explosive growth of newer options such as Uber and Ola shows there is a massive need for public transport options because not everyone can afford these cab services, and private enterprises can fill the breach left by state-sponsored infrastructure. Lack of sanitation is a major problem in developing countries like India. Much deliberation has given way to the fact that the private sector is needed to tackle sanitation service problems. It is imperative to invest in solutions by offering different sanitation products and services at appropriate prices. Improved sanitation is considered to be a huge market for private businesses, since 2.6 billion people or 41 percent of the world's population until now does not have access to basic sanitation. An increased focus on sanitation and hygiene is something that can be a motivating idea for startups. Sulabh is a glaring example of a startup that began work in this area and has today raised the benchmark for many others in this field. Urban areas of India generate 1,88,500 tonnes of municipal solid waste (68.8 million tonnes per year), and waste generation increases by 50 percent every decade. More than 80 percent of this waste reaches open dumpsites causing public health issues, environmental degradation, and resultant climate change. Plastic and e-waste form the major chunk of this waste, with minimal facilities to take care of such environment degrading substances. India needs to find solution to these problems. Fresh and innovative ideas in consonance with the ambitious Swachh Bharat Abhiyan are required to solve this problem, which otherwise can have drastic repercussions in the near future. Pollution in India is a definite offshoot of many other environmental problems  be it air, water, land, or noise. New technologies have the potential to revolutionise the way air pollution research and policy are conducted, with a more efficient people-focussed approach. Technology can also help harness new sources of energy. One major source of environmental emissions are cars. A typical driver spends 106 days of his/her life looking for a parking space. This commute itself contributes to increased traffic and air pollution. India needs smarter transportation options as well, and this is where startups can pitch in apart from other ways to tackle pollution. One such way is carpooling; this will have a two-way benefit in the form of reducing pollution (both air and noise) and the traffic on the roads. The odd-even traffic rule imposed by the Delhi government to combat toxic air pollution in the national capital also kicked off on a good note. An MoU signed between the Delhi government and University of Chicago in December 2015 was a step aimed at combating the pollution levels in the city. A two-month-long challenge called the Urban Labs Innovation Challenge  Delhi was planned under this to invite fresh ideas to improve air and water quality in the capital. The best idea would be rewarded with a seed fund of Rs 2 crore. Startups are now making a beeline to address this issue and they are the best in the field both in terms of technology and intelligence. Smart Air Filters, a Delhi-based startup, produces an indoor air purifier that is highly effective against PM 2.5, the primary air pollutant affecting urban Indian cities. This PM 2.5 results from combustion, such as exhaust from cars and trucks (diesel and petrol), coal production, and other biomass burning. was earlier limited to only a handful of people who could afford training and coaching. Coaching institutes and classes were meant only for some. Today, despite increase in incomes, access to quality learning is still limited to what is available to students around. This is where startups are and can be the game changers. Ed-tech products have proved to be a boon in this regard. Gaming is an addiction with the younger generation who feels happy and satisfied with rewards. Why not then change study into play and develop apps that can educate students while making it a child's play, literally! More such innovative and out-of-the-box ideas are the need of the hour for easy access to quality education. Education in India is undergoing a transformation like never before. Ed-tech startups can thus champion the cause of access, quality, and performance. A simple device like an incubator needs continuous supply of electricity. In smaller towns, particularly for hospitals catering to old people and new born babies, electricity cannot be a major impediment. It has to be a way ahead. Innovating products and services around the conditions prevailing in the country is the need of the hour. One such condition is unreliable and fluctuating power, particularly in the rural and semi-urban clusters. This does not need any fundamental technological breakthrough but innovative solutions. There are problems related to phase balancing, overload, and loss in the distribution network as a whole. A Bengaluru-based startup has come up with an innovative product that guarantees zero power loss due to theft and commercial reasons. The product designed by them enables peak reduction without causing any inconvenience to customers. It also eliminates the need for power cuts and automates the entire power distribution, billing, and payment processes. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reveals that there were 3,09,546 incidents of crime against women in 2013 in India. Crimes against women have only shown an increase in the last five years. Safety is definitely one of the growing concerns in our country, particularly with . Technology and access to it can solve many issues that women face in their day to day lives. Many startups have already taken the initiative to introduce products in the form of apps to ensure safety for women. They utilise features like GPS tracking, safe and unsafe areas on maps, ways to send alerts to emergency contacts, and scream alarms. In most semi-urban areas of India, the tap gets water every two to 10 days. However, mostly it is difficult to say which days. Another point to ponder is whether this water is fit for human consumption or not. Access to clean drinking water is one of Indias biggest challenges. A growing population, rapid urbanisation, and the growing demand for water from agriculture, energy, and industry are the other contributing factors. According to UNICEF, only a quarter of the total population in India has drinking water on their premises and nearly three-quarters of all diseases in India are caused by contaminants in the water supply. As an example, P. Lakshmi Rao, a self-made entrepreneur, has decided to ensure that people have access to clean drinking water. In November 2015, she launched the water ATM facility, where people can draw a litre of clean water for as little as Rs 5. This water ATM purifies the water extracted from ground water and municipal corporation water. It is no ordinary purifier. The machine follows a seven-stage water purification process. Startups are the right platform for innovative solutions that can provide access to clean water in the country. In India, where crime rates shoot above the roof, the need of the hour is for innovative and technological solutions to prevent and address crime. Much has been spoken about funding for startups, but are the entrepreneurial minds developing something to address crime? For instance, Shruti Dixit is one among the many entrepreneurs working to solve this problem. Deeply disturbed by the molestation and rape incidents at schools and a parent herself, she decided to develop mySafeBus, a hardware smartphone-like device that is embedded with a software, and can be fitted in school buses for real-time visual surveillance and monitoring. While technology is one of the ways to monitor crime, the solution is not this alone. Changing the fabric of the society and the government is also imperative. India is changing everyday and it's changing to get better. Although, India does not require the cut and paste innovation, it needs to address these issues by creative out-of-the-box thinking and resolve various pain points which are not addressed by the traditional ways. At present, there are more than 3,100 startups established and running, which are focusing and working tirelessly to address various pain points to make our lives simpler and efficient. However, the challenges mentioned above still require serious contemplation and robust solutions.","How many empty cardboard boxes do you have in your home? If you shop online, the answer is probably quite a few. But what if you had a way to take all of those boxes and do some good with them? Thats what Monika Wiela thought about when she decided to launch her charitable startup, . The idea behind Give Back Box is simple. Online shoppers can use their cardboard shipping boxes to send some of their unwanted goods to secondhand charity organizations. It allows them to clear space in their homes, donate some unwanted items to worthy causes, and recycle. Wiela first got the idea for her charitable startup, Give Back Box, when she was walking through Chicago one day and saw a homeless man with a sign asking for shoes. She didnt have any shoes to give him, but she thought about one item that she did have in abundance  cardboard boxes. While they wouldnt immediately help the homeless man she saw on the street that day, she did see the potential. Wiela was already a successful entrepreneur before starting Give Back Box. She is also the founder of online shoe store .In fact, she was able to use that company to test the concept for Give Back Box for a year before its official launch. For the test, she simply included a prepaid mailing label addressed to a secondhand charity inside each box, along with donation instructions. That way, shoppers could use the shipping boxes to send some of their unwanted goods to new homes. Currently, the program partners with Goodwill for its donations and Goodwill covers the cost of shipping to increase contributions. During the test with StyleUpGirl, 13% of customers used their boxes to send unwanted goods to charity. Now, Give Back Box has partnerships with other online retailers like and .The company also allows other online shoppers to print out shipping labels from its website so they can use boxes from other retailers in the same way. This program may have grown from one womans desire to help someone, but it makes a lot of sense on different levels. It provides an easy way to recycle and get rid of unwanted items while helping charitable organizations. And it can improve brand reputation for StyleUpGirl and the other partner retailers when customers see their focus on environmentalism and philanthropy. Wiela in an interview with Fast Company:","With Halloween almost here, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday arent far behind. For small retailers, that means its time to gear up for your holiday marketing moves. Like last years, this is a short holiday shopping season (just 26 days between Black Friday and Christmas, compared to the more typical 31), so youll want to make the most of it. Here are some steps you can take to make your shop stand out from the crowd. Planning ahead will give you an edge, enable you to budget better and ensure you dont miss important dates. This year: Create a marketing calendar working back from these and other key dates, breaking down the actions youll need to take to meet deadlines. For instance, if you want to send a direct mail piece to arrive before Thanksgiving, when do you need to design and submit the ad? Send early holiday cards (such as a Thanksgiving card) to give thanks for your loyal customers support all year long. Better yet, invite them to a special event or sale, and sweeten the pot with a discount or free gift offer. Prepare to provide great customer service with little touches like free gift wrap or a gift-wrapping station, a personal shopper to help customers select gifts, or displays with pre-wrapped gifts for certain recipients such as teacher gifts, gifts for Mom or baby gifts. Choose an event thats festive for the season, but also relates to your store, such as an author signing or reading at a bookstore, a musical performance of holiday songs at a CD store or a cookie-decorating demonstration at a gourmet food store. Events attract crowds and spur spending. In 2013, gift cards were the number-one gift shoppers planned to buy, according to a Nielsen . and are two companies that offer gift cards for small retailers; you can also see if your bank offers gift card options. Gift cards arent only for gifts; consider doing a give one, get one promotion where customers buy a $100 gift card or $100 worth of merchandise and get a $25 gift card for themselves. With many Americans still watching their wallets, lots of shoppers wait for holiday sales to treat themselves to things they want or need. Window signage or ads promoting two-for-one; buy one, get one half off; or outright encouraging customers to treat themselves are very effective during the holidays. Engage customers senses with colorful decorations, festive holiday music, seasonal scents like pine or cinnamon, and refreshments to keep shoppers from dropping. Music or scents that waft outside your store can attract foot traffic. Turn your business neighbors into marketing partners by creating promotions, contests and special events together. For example, hold a 12 Days of Christmas giveaway where 12 retailers in your shopping center each give away a prize a day for 12 days. (Be sure to check into what your local business association is planning, too.) Last year, 71 percent of U.S. consumers said they were aware of Small Business Saturday, and nearly half (46 percent) actively supported it by shopping at a local small business. The result: $5.7 billion in sales.

If your business has a Company Page, the tab will be history as of April 14, 2014. For now you can edit your existing tab but can no longer add new products to it.

We have a gazebo and a whole group of retailers nestled around the square. Beyond the square, almost hidden from sight and across the railroad tracks, are several industrial parks with even more manufacturers and technology companies than you can count. You can call these local businesses. Some are more local than others. But all of them are a contribution to our local and global economy. But every time I talk to some of the owners, I hear a subtle tone of dissatisfaction  competition, difficulty in finding customers and, of course, keeping costs low.

Small business marketers are playing a constant game of catch-up as the online world marches steadily onward. Its a game that can be very easy to lose when you dont have a full-time marketing staff to keep tabs on things 24/7. Think your online marketing strategy might be living in the past? Not even sure what an up-to-date online marketing strategy looks like? These four signs indicate that it might be time to stir things up a bit and trade those proverbial bell bottoms for app development, Pinterest and Vine. Now, Im not saying that uploading photos to Facebook is a bad thing. But using big, corporate-owned platforms and not hosting any of your own content on your own website, for example  not such a great idea. There are two big reasons for this: Not sure how to get started? It might be time to hire a web designer to get you set up. Does MySpace ring a bell? Xanga? LiveJournal?These early social networking sites all had their day, to be sure, but that day is long gone.In fact, many of them are totally shifting gears to appeal to different audiences, or simply arent used or functional in any useful capacity anymore. I know it can be tough for small businesses to keep up with every single new social network, and its not always worth it to be an early adopter when you dont know whats going to fly  but it is important to find the networks that are thriving and right for your business. This more technical side of online marketing can be intimidating and just a little bit bewildering. Youre already running a marketing campaign  now you need to analyze it, too. True, it takes a little bit more work, but tracking data can go a long way in ensuring that the effort you put into marketing is well-placed. And the good news is, you dont need to be a math or programming whiz to measure the success of your online marketing strategy. The days when you could churn out content and try to reach everyone with it are over. Now, is a necessity. Theres simply so much of the Web to reach that you need to strategize and produce content accordingly. Even more, you need to post that segmented content in the right places. What you post on Pinterest, for example, is going to be very different from what you post on LinkedIn. The key to online marketing success is right there in the title of this post: Strategy. The biggest sign that your online marketing strategy is outdated might be the fact that you have no strategy. If this is the case, its time to put your nose to the grindstone, figure out your audience, create an editorial calendar and start writing content that adds up to a greater whole. And of course, dont forget to measure the results of your online marketing strategy.","We joke about how many social media experts are out there these days and that theyre multiplying like rabbits. And, to be honest, the state of social media experts a joke. It seems like it doesnt take much more than a Twitter account (actively followed or not) for someone to declare themselves a guru and throw it on their resume. But that kind of expertness doesnt get you too far.  So, if youre a small business owner who really does want to educate themselves on the topic and learn how to reach out to customers, where do you go?  How does someone go about learning how to connect with and market to customers using these new social tools? Here are a few responsible ways I think people are learning the ins and outs of social media.  Id love to hear about some of the ways youre teaching yourself (or others). For good or bad, blogs are one of the most common ways that business owners are learning about the field of social media. Theyre reading guides, taking in insight from bloggers and learning through the personal examples shared by others.  Blogs are a great source of information because theres always an abundance of new information to take in each day and posts often spark very likely conversations. Of course, the simple fact that anyone can say anything on a blog means that you should take care to investigate someones credentials before you take their word at face value. Some of the more prominent (and trustworthy) blogs on social media include Online communities give SMB owners a forum for person-to-person communication that is sometimes hard to replicate on blogs.  A SMB owner can enter a forum with a question and others will jump into action to pool their knowledge and help point them in the right direction.  Forums also give business owners to talk out ideas, brainstorm strategies and create real relationships that can be taken offline (or at least out of the community). As with blogs, you should always use your own sanity check on the information being shared.   Sometimes well-intentioned people are just thatwell intentioned  Some examples of online communities may include , developed by Brian Clark, Darren Rowse, Chris Brogan and Sonia Simone. This community aims to help people with Internet marketing strategies that work without being obnoxious and often focus on social strategies.   If youre looking for a more informal online community, tweetups, and Facebook Groups all allow wannabe social media experts to find one another and share ideas and information. LinkedIn, especially, has a great number of active groups on social media and SMB issues. Webinars can be another great way for small business owners to learn and network on the topic of social media. Just because you cant afford to jet off to or , doesnt mean you have to miss out when some the experts come together for a mind meld. Webinars like the ones offered by the can help business owners master the basics, while also letting them explore newer concepts. Webinars like the series can help you get up to speed on a specific platform that may be of interest.   You can often set up Google Alerts for terms like [keyword] + webinar or [area of interest] + webinar to stay up to date on the latest ones happening, or just watch your favorite topic-relevant blogs or Twitterers for announcements. Taking some time to attend the many real-life conferences that may be happening in your area is another excellent way for small business owners to learn.  These seminars give business owners invaluable opportunities to not only learn from people who live and breathe what they teach, but to network with others in their area, as well.  And, luckily, they dont always require such lavish budgets. For example, you may remember the Hands on Small Business seminars that took place last year that aimed to help SMB owners get their hands dirty in social media and GetListed.org has recently started traveling across the country with to provide education to SMB owners on everything related to marketing their sites on the Web. At the end of the day, many would argue that the best way to learn about social media is simply to get in and do it.  If this is your approach, then Id recommend jumping in to , not get involved.  Find the leaders in your area or the social media power users that you look up to. See what theyre doing and how theyre talking and learn from their behaviors. The key to learning about social media on the Web is to find the sources you trust and to learn from what they do.  Much of social media is really about customer service and treating people better than they expect, but the more you can learn about the tools at your disposable and what theyre capable of the better.  How have you learned about social media? What has or has not helped you?","The maker movement started to gain major awareness a few years ago, but it is a movement that has been going on for a long time. Most cultures have innovation and creativity in their DNA and making something by hand is part of how you solve a physical problem or need. Its been a while since I previously compiled a list of . As the saying goes, time flies, and I decided it was time to revisit the topic by providing another 20 sites and resources for selling craft and homemade items. There are many general eCommerce platforms to help artists, crafters and makers, but the goal of this post is to share marketplaces and solutions that focus on this niche. More clearly, Im not profiling all of the eCommerce leaders like BigCommerce, Shopify, and others. (Ive done that with along with . ) allows indie artisans to create a social storefront. More interesting is how they have built it with a community focus. Individual neighborhoods or marketplaces can build an online community with individual merchants in it. For example, the built one and it highlights the community first, then you can walk into an individual store or offer. Another example of this community first approach can be found in almost every U.S. State. You can search for handmade marketplace [michigan]  obviously insert your state. Youll get a great list and thats how I found , which offers a Google Map that shows craft stores, resources and more for DIY types. West Virginia has . Foodies and farmers will want to do the same type of search farmers markets [insert state]. Nearly every state has something to help you find farmers markets, food festivals and healthy food providers. Using Michigan as an example again: .

The site is believable with store owner testimonials. There is a free forever version, then premium paid accounts. The is a great resource and membership site.

I like their Pinterest board and pins which go direct to member sites. is focused on helping the UK artisan, craftsperson and vintage product creator to market their wares. They have a craft forum and offer lots of advice to help their sellers succeed. Jumping to the foodie front again, if you love indie, artisan-made food, then you have to visit . They started as New York Mouth to highlight locally made foods and then decided that online local could include many more local hotspots for good food. Great site and products. To be clear, they pick the products they will accept in their marketplace, so in that way they differ from most of these services. But if you have an established, stellar food product, you will want to consider . But you can also get ideas for how to market your own products by following their lead. Hat tip to for a blog post that listed out a number of artisanal foodie marketplaces (some of which I included in my last post so I did not repeat them here). The is a collection of craft stores.

If you are selling at physical markets in your local area, do not forget to look at , or Intuits card readers that connect to your smartphone or iPad. Some work with the Nexus 10 (Im a huge fan of Googles tablet). These tiny card readers allow you to process payments on-the-fly  and in the case of Square  it is pretty affordable with a flat-rate of 2.75 percent per swipe. If you have been watching the maker movement, now is your time to start an indie business. Handmade products are in high demand. But perhaps not all of them, so do your research. There are many local physical marketplaces starting to shift their focus to handmade goods. How are you marketing and selling craft and homemade products?","There just seem to be more decisions everyday when it comes to choosing that next mobile business device. Up until now, the e-reader and the tablet have not been synonymous. But for entrepreneurs between the office and that next meeting or traveling, both have been helpful to stay productive. Now theres buzz in tech circles that by this fall a couple of new devices could completely blur those lines. New Kindle Fire HDs being reported by several sources could be more connective with more processing speed and more memory like a tablet. But they could feature the lower price tag that has made e-readers so popular. New photos posted by TheVerge.com show familiar looking Kindle Fire HD devices in 7-inch and 8.9 inch formats. Specs for the new : Reports arent clear about the probable price of these new devices. But with the iPad priced at $499, the and the current Kindle Fire at $199, the new Kindles could be very competitive, industry experts predict.","You have an eCommerce business. Maybe you sell antiques on eBay. Maybe you have a thriving toy business selling through Amazon. When deciding how to set your prices or maybe even what to sell in the first place  it would be great to have more information. For example, what is the average price paid for the kind of antique vase youre planning to start selling in your eBay store? More importantly perhaps, how many of them have sold recently on eBay? You could do a bit of browsing yourself, of course. You could search similar products on eBay and Amazon and see how theyre priced. The trouble is, this may not tell you everything you need to know. Are the couple of listings you browsed typical of what the vast majority of people are paying for that particular item? Or are they outliers priced by sellers who dont really know their market? And how many of these things have really sold at that price anyway? Finally, theres location to consider. Sure, that digital camera youve been able to source from an overseas distributor is popular. But is it selling to customers in the U.S. where most of your orders tend to originate? You get the idea. Kevin North, CEO of eCommerce analytics platform , says about 1.3 million merchants on eBay and Amazon already have access to all of dataand more. Watch this video for a brief overview of what North says this Software-as-a-Service can do: Founded originally by eBay merchants, Terapeak benefits from 10 years of data pulled directly from eBay through a formal agreement with the eCommerce giant. The software has access to millions of transactions a day from which it can determine not only what people are buying and how much theyre paying for it, but itcan even track your competitors  those people who are selling what you sell, North said. Last summer, Terapeak began including data from Amazon in its results too. Because the company has no formal agreement with this massive online retailer, North said Terapeak cant give its customers quite the same level of insight. For example, the software can still follow sales behavior, pricing and trends. But Terapeak cant track your competitors in the way possible on eBay. With the Terapeak app downloaded to a mobile phone, North says online retailers can even make decisions before they buy something to resell. For example, lets go back to the idea of an eBay antique seller. You might be at an estate sale and come across a find you believe you could sell successfully. A click of the Terapeak app will tell you the average the item is selling for on eBay or Amazon. So you will be able to judge whether a product might be profitable before you even spend a cent, the company says. Finally, with so out there, some merchants dont use either eBay or Amazon. Even these sellers may want to use Terapeak, says North. As two of the largest retailers on the Internet, they influence pricing on all other sites too. North explains: Terapeak has recently simplified its pricing structure. The service now costs a flat $29.95 monthly or $179.95 yearly.","Lisa Barone recently wrote about Network Solutions CEO Roy Dunbar was joined by several people to offer suggestions. One of the key points coming from the group is that SEO and search is one of the most powerful things a small business can invest in. Many small business owners are missing out on the potential traffic and sales they could get if their web sites were optimized for search engines. Location is everything  even online. An SEO company helps your web site rise to the top of search engines when someone types in words relating to your business. In my last post I went over Now Ill talk about the opposite  what a good SEO company should do. A good SEO company should do the following things: Once you determine these words, they will form the basis of your SEO efforts. When you target a particular phrase you usually get residual ranking benefits. In other words you can rank well for similar phrases. When people link at you in editorial channels, they not only link, but in many cases leave behind an endorsement. Assuming they are writing to a relevant targeted audience then you just gained a bunch of social proof of value and reached a wider audience in a means that is much cheaper and more effective than traditional advertising. Also look for credentials from the industry. I know of more of these from the paid search side rather than for SEO companies. One example is a Certified Google AdWords Reseller. This shows that they are interested in keeping community standards. Remember that reputable companies dont try to hide from the Search Engines. They seek relationships with them. They want to ensure they work with them in the most transparent way possible. My favorite SEO tactic? Blogging. Set up correctly (applying the same principles I outlined above), a company or even personal blog can be a great tool for SEO. If creating your own blog isnt a good fit, participating on other peoples blog by leaving comments or writing a guest post using keywords is also effective. SEO is a form of marketing. There are many approaches to getting links. The best approach for your business depends on many factors. However there are fundamentals that dont change which every small business should be aware of especially in this economy.

Videos are easier to digest for consumers and can be much more interactive, so its no surprise that YouTube is becoming more popular for educational and informative videos. In other words, if funny and witty videos work for your business you might have more luck, but just about any company can make a video work for a website. So logically if you put a video on a website, the natural next step is to onto a company YouTube page. But what about tracking your YouTube marketing success? What metrics should you be tracking to improve your YouTube marketing? And what tools are best? Fortunately, its pretty simple if you know what to watch. YouTube still doesnt have the greatest analytics data options, but they do have a few that you should take advantage of when trying to analyze your YouTube efforts. Your first step, however, is to on YouTube in the first place. Below is a screenshot of a test: As you can see, this is an overview page that offers quick data regarding how your page was found by visitors, demographics, your top 10 videos, engagement, and performance including views and estimated time someone watches your videos. The features that can be significant to marketers that are in the top right hand corner include: Of course, there are quite a few other features on the left hand side that are important to watch. This deeper data is divided into Views and Engagement. Below explains the most important metrics to use for YouTube marketing success and why and how you can use them to your advantage. All of the following metrics are found under the Views section of analytics: This metric will give you an aggregated number that refers to the total time that the video has been played. This is not only great so you can see which videos are getting the most watch time and therefore succeeding, but it can help you to use this number in relation to conversions. In the screenshot below, youll see that the timeframe has been adjusted(here it was merely because this was a test, but this could be helpful for your own comparisons). You also have the option to compare metrics, see them in a pie chart, and more: When you click Playback Location, you get metrics that tell you where your video was viewed. Typically, this will be either through YouTube versus when you or someone else embedded the video onto another webpage. This is always interesting because it helps make sure that your videos are being viewed where you intended, but better yet you might find surprising results that will actually change your strategy. For fun, the screenshot below shows the data suing the color-coding display option (which you can see is chosen just the left of the graph, which is the same as how theline graph in the last screenshot was chosen): This hasnt always been a top metric, but with the latest Google changes and the way the search space is changing sharing it has become crucial. This feature will show you the number of shares based on each of the major social media networks including Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Who subscribes to your company YouTube page is key because this will help you increase page views, time watched, and other metrics. You will get data on how many subscribers youve gained as well as how many youve lost if you use the compare metric function, and YouTube can even identify which videos are helping you gain these subscribers. Knowing this information can help you ensure that youre only producing the videos that will help you earn subscribers.

You leave with an impressive qualification which can set up your career and set you on the road to success.

In other words, Upstart backers are not investing in a company, and they are not investing in a new product ala Kickstarter. They are investing in a promising person. In return for backing a person, the Upstart backers are given a cut of that persons earnings for a fixed term  but only once those are over $20,000 a year. An applicant has to upload transcripts, GMAT and SAT scores, a resume, and more. Then an algorithm written by Paul Gu, a co-founder of Upstart, determines how good a bet the person is, by calculating future earnings. Several factors are taken into account, in order to decide. This can include things like what qualifications the person has and any previous earnings. Backers can then choose whether or not to invest in you, and even mentor you. Upstart hasbacking from Google Ventures and high profile investors. For instance, the photographs of Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban also appear on their page listing investors. The site is still in its infancy, though. According to the Upstart website, they have invested nearly $3 million, but show just 329 backers and 242 Upstarts as of this writing. Some have criticized Upstart as indentured servitude or slavery. Will Herman, a Boston angel investor, that he was one of those critics. Yet, if it gives the person the start he or she needs, and backers are limited in the amount they get in return, calling it indentured servitude seems like harsh criticism.","Online reviews have become important  and positive reviews are crucial for businesses. Two customer review trends are important to know. First, prospective customers are increasingly to make purchasing decisions. Second, theres been an explosion in fake reviews online. Its gotten so bad, that sites like Yelp and the New York Attorney General have been . Where does this leave small businesses? Businesses have an increasing need to get positive customer reviews. At the same time, small businesses also have to keep things ethical, even in the face of competitors who may be playing dirty. A product called Get Five Stars can help satisfy both of these needs. is an online app or tool that guides you through the process of how to get positive customer reviews. It helps you: After all, if a customer is willing to recommend your business, dont you want to show that review off? And dont you want as many other prospective customers to see it as possible? Plus, the proactive nature of Get Five Stars helps you catch negative reviews. That way, you can attempt to resolve any issues before they cause lasting harm. In essence, Get Five Stars gives you a process and shows you how to get positive customer reviews. It helps you organize and streamline the process of requesting and displaying customer reviews, and increasing their visibility online. That way you can make the most of them for online visibility and to convince new shoppers to buy from you. The process to request reviews from your existing customers is straight forward. Right in the dashboard, business owners can insert customer names and email addresses. You could add customer data from your invoicing system, a Contacts app, or a CRM database  or insert it manually. Then, of course, you are going to want to communicate with customers. To do that, you call up pre-built email templates (see image below). Customize your email message, and then send it to your customer requesting feedback. Its a two-step process with customers. As part of the process, you: The process is kicked off when the customer receives an email that looks like the image below, with an invitation to leave a review by clicking a big button Provide Feedback: Customers are busy. Most dont have the time to spend writing a long review or filling out a lengthy survey. The beauty of Get Five Stars is that the review system is easy peasy. Get Five Stars uses the Net Promoter approach to customer feedback. There are just two short text fields to fill in  the title of the review, and a brief comment with a maximum of 250 characters. Customers then are asked one question, How likely is it that you would recommend our company to a friend or colleague? Customers then rate the business from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best (i.e., most likely to recommend). The customer simply moves a sliding scale button to rate (see below). If a customer answers by giving a rating below a 7, then the small business gets the information and can follow up. In this way, potentially negative reviews can be addressed proactively. Some small business owners and managers may not be familiar with the Net Promoter feedback scoring system. The app gives the business owner a little tutorial on Net Promoter scores in a popup window. Once the customer feedback is returned, you have a place in the dashboard where you can see all your feedback. Then from there, you can send out another followup communication to customers that left positive feedback, asking them to leave the review on various public review sites such as Google, Yahoo Local, Citysearch, Facebook and other places. On the apps dashboard you choose which review sites you want to request the customer to leave a review on. Remember, you cant place the review on the site for them  but the app makes it easy for you to request and assist the customer to do so. Interestingly, co-founder downplayed Yelp when we spoke with him. He saidseeking out Yelp reviews may not help you. Unless the reviewer is an avid Yelper the review is often filtered out and doesnt show up publicly on Yelp, due to Yelps algorithms. Also, he points out, the apps language does not actually request leaving a Yelp review. It is against Yelps guidelines to ask for reviews. Therefore, the app simply includes a small message in the email asking customers to visit the businesss page on Yelp. The reviews you get back can also be embedded on a page on your companys website (see below) using a small embedded bit of javascript code. Theres also a WordPress plugin to put the testimonials into WordPress sites. The embedded testimonials also appear as HTML on your website page. The reason thats important is that when they are in HTML format, the reviews can get indexed by search engines. Reviews are structured using the Schema.org format, a markup language that Google understands. That means they can under certain circumstances show up in the snippet of text presented in Google search result pages. When you have gold review stars appearing near your website name on a search page, it helps your brand stand out. Getting too many reviews too quickly can be almost as bad or worse than too few reviews. To a search engine or review site getting too many too fast may seem suspicious. So lets say you start using the product and do a one-time communication to all your recent customers asking for reviews. Youre going to get a lot of reviews back. You may not want to display them all or encourage all those customers to leave public reviews, at one time.  The business owner or manager has control over the timing. Get Five Stars also monitors key review sites, as part of an ongoing reputation management process. You get a dashboard that is regularly updated, to see how many reviews you have and the average rating (below). This way you dont have to visit each of the review sites separately. The Get Five Stars system will also send you an email when a new review appears. According to co-founder Don Campbell, by being proactive you can have a big impact on how your company is presented to the world. He described the case study of an optometrist that had just one review showing on Yelp and it was a very bad 1 star review. The optometrist knew this customer. His frames had broken, but that incident had been fixed.  The optometrist KNEW the customer had been made happy. In that case the optometrist was able to contact the customer. The monitoring dashboard would help to let you know so that you could contact the reviewer and ask him to update the review if you know the issue has been resolved. Or you could leave a message yourself clarifying inaccurate information in the review, such as a restaurant review that gives a bad rating for a dish your establishment does not even offer.

Simple Loose Leaf offers an alternative to these tea shops. allows customers to have loose leaf tea delivered to their doorstep each month. Subscription packages like this have been gaining popularity with other items too. Siteslike and deliver everything from health food to video game swag right to you. But co-founder Andrew Flocks the Business Opportunities Weblog: The site is owned by Andrew brother Nicholas, and sister, Sarah.The business began in a brainstorming session two years back as the brothers tried to think of a website they could create together. Tea kept popping up, but with so many big names in the game already it was hard to imagine they would be able to bring much to the table. Until finally, they thought of doing a subscription service in 2013. And so Simple Loose Leaf was born. Customers have the ability to choose from a nearly endless combination of teas. Each box comes packed with 4-6 teas, with enough to make quite a few cups. Choices include black, white, oolong, puehr, herbal and more. Customers can even create their own personal tea care package. One, three, and six month subscriptions are available. And Flocks says one customer has even purchased two consecutive six month subscriptions. Thats a years worth of customized tea care packages. As Flocks points out, the customization is what sets the site and the business apart. Itoffers customers the ability to build their own monthly tea box. This gives them the freedom to adjust it to their taste instead of receiving a random or predetermined assortment. As the company website says, Simple Loose Leaf:","Youre a small business owner. Most of your customers are the people who live within 25 miles of your storefront. Why does it even matter what the Internet has to say about your brand? That has no impact on your bottom line. Right? No. Dangerously wrong. Weber Shandwick recently released a new report called [PDF] that breaks down exactly why business owners should be concerned with the online footprint theyre leaving (or not leaving) behind. One of the most interesting parts of the report for me was the finding that disconnect between corporate and brand reputation triggers a sharp consumer reaction. That means even if your product or service is excellentif the image of your brand is less than stellar, it will still hurt you. According to the report, when a consumer learns that a product they like is made by a company they have a negative relationship with (54 percent of consumers responded theyve experienced this), 96 percent of consumers took some kind of action. What kind of action? The most frequent response was that . In fact, surprised consumers were twice as likely to STOP buying the product as they were to continue to buy it. And this is a product they originally admitted to liking! That was pretty startling to me. Just as noteworthy  consumers who didnt immediately stop buying the product went online to try and learn more about the company. Both of these statements speak to the importance of creating a positive Web presence. It doesnt matter if youre not trying to target a national audience. Local consumers are using the Web to find information about local businesses. Its up to you to make sure theyre finding the right kind of information. What should every small business be doing to help build their Web presence? Online reputation management is important for businesses of any size. Its about creating a positive Web presence to make your brand one that people trust and to engage with. Because, as the report mentioned above shows, it doesnt matter how great your product is  if people dont trust , they wont be interested in it.","OnMarch 3, at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona, Blackberry its latest smartphone.

But the truth is if you cant afford to then you cant afford to be in business. Theres another cost that we sometimes avoid. Thats feedback. Feedback costs us upfront in time and energy. It takes effort to find out and record what people think. It also costs us on the back end, especially if the feedback is painful, because the truth stings sometimes. Selling people what you they want is more profitable than you guessing at what you they want and being upset and confused when they dont buy. Customer feedback is your chance to listen to what your audience has to sayand then do something about what you hear. I see it like this: Feedback saves you money, wasted effort and unnecessary actions. Think about it: Use feedback to find out what your people really like, and once you know, you can deliver it, consistently. Have you ever asked somebody what they thought, just to discover that you hated their answer? I have. And how did you respond when it happened to you? (You dont have to tell me.) And it needs to be an ongoing part of your company if you intend to grow with your clients and remain in business. Here are three ways to get that feedback:","When you browse the Internet, you probably notice very personalized banner ads following you around. Often, when you visit a particular company site but dont purchase, that site will drop a cookie so the company may then serve you relevant ads to bring you back. This is a form of online advertising called retargeting, behavioral retargeting or remarketing. Retargeting has proven to be a highly effective way to convert customers. Consider how distracted we are as we do online research or purchasing. Phone calls, emails, or chat windows regularly interrupt me, for example. These interruptions result in my abandoning a shopping cart or forgetting what I was doing entirely. Retargeting is rapidly become an integral part of online marketing and advertising for one simple reason  it works. You can effectively capture those visitors who have already expressed interest in your products or services and never completed a purchase. As consumers, we are going to be served ads no matter what, so why not have those ads be for the things we are interested in? Below, Ive listed a quick look at some of the best (and more affordable) retargeting companies that can help you get your campaigns started. : Built into your existing Adwords account, Google makes it easy to begin remarketing on the Google Display Network, with very flexible pricing. : Set up a campaign in minutes and gain access to prime online real estate with AdRoll. Theyve been around since 2007 and they know what theyre doing. : ReTargeter offers a comprehensive starter package for just $500. Known for their stellar customer service, you even get a dedicated account manager working to make sure all of your needs are met. Fetchback: Fetchback offers a full product suite to make sure your campaign is set up in the way that is most effective for your business. Dont overdo it. Make sure you limit the number of times you serve ads to the same people so as to not scare away someone who could become a very loyal customer. You dont want to be the creepy company that doesnt appear to value privacy because it follows its customers all across the Internet.","Social media marketing on Twitter is not a numbers game, and most companies dont realize this. Brands focus on collecting as many Twitter followers as they can by any means possible, even though most of these followers never engage with the brand or add any value to the social media marketing campaigns of these companies. Companies that have thousands of followers on Twitter have very little engagement from these followers, as most of these accounts are either fake, inactive or are owned by other companies that have nothing in common with the brands. One of the biggest mistakes a company can make is following other Twitter accounts that have nothing in common with the company or collecting Twitter followers that do not share the same interests as the company. Instead of wasting time on collecting followers, focus your energies on improving engagement with your Twitter followers. Most small businesses have limited resources and cannot afford to have inefficient social media marketing campaigns. To ensure that your Twitter marketing campaign succeeds, you need your followers to share your tweets and content with their followers. You want actively engaged followers who will also give honest feedback and pave the way for open dialogue between your brand and its followers. Below are a few pointers that will show you how. It goes without saying that instead of focusing on the number of followers, you need to focus on the type of followers you are collecting. This is why you need to follow the right Twitter users, who will in turn follow you back, as such users will have a lot in common with your brand. Ensure that the accounts your brand is following have similar profiles and are in the same industry. Following industry experts is a great way to gather valuable content on Twitter that you can share with your followers. This method may not give you a follower base in the thousands, but it will ensure that most of your followers actively engage with your content and brand. Even after collecting relevant followers, there may be no engagement with your brand if your tweets are irrelevant. You need to establish your brand as an industry expert to maximize engagement. This can be done if you tweet valuable and original content. Tweet links to your company blog posts that have relevant and interesting content. Instead of rehashing existing articles, offer your own point of view and predictions. Your followers will find it useful and will want to retweet your tweets. To continue conversations with clients and to have stronger relationships with them, you need to respond to their comments, retweets, shout-outs, questions, etc. as quickly as possible. By using the @replies feature on Twitter, you can check the interactions and mentions of your brand on Twitter and reply to questions promptly. Also make sure to have an FAQ blog post. Link to it regularly on Twitter so that followers can follow the link if they have more questions. Always remember to thank followers who retweet, share and comment on your tweets, and use @[Their Username] in the tweet to give them a shout out. You can also use direct messages to communicate with engaged followers who require more information about your brand. It may not always be possible to create long blog posts with valuable content and tweet them on a daily basis. In such cases, tweeting daily tips or fun facts is a great idea, as such tweets generally get a lot of engagement. Also, these posts are bite-sized and easy to read, which is always a good thing on Twitter. You can also include behind-the-scenes images or ask interesting questions to followers. is not exactly a Twitter feature, but an event created by Twitter followers to highlight other users. Use the #FollowFriday hashtag in your tweet to place the spotlight on certain followers who engage with your brand frequently. This is a great way to reward certain followers and to appreciate their efforts. You can also create special edition #FollowFriday events with specific themes and tag followers accordingly.","The modern business is bursting at the seams with data, but making sense of it all can feel like the job of a master mathematician. Because theres now so much data available, business intelligence applications have become a vital part of a small businesss arsenal of strategic tools. Business intelligence reporting apps and dashboards bring all company data together, helping you focus on company objectives and react quickly to opportunities. The best part is, the latest generation of business intelligence tools can be used by anyone, meaning you dont need an IT team  or even have to be technically savvy  to help you make sense of all that data. Theres also no shortage of business intelligence and dashboard applications to choose from. Many of these are cloud-based solutions that make them cost effective, easy to implement, and simple to scale to your business. Some of the key benefits of implementing a business intelligence tool for your small businessare outlined below, as well as 10 of the best business dashboard apps. Small businesses generally have very limited resources and offer a limited scope of products and services. By implementing a business intelligence tool, data about your pipeline, your revenue, and your margins can be analyzed in the same way across all departments, which means that everyone can be more focused on your main business objectives. As (PDF), Meeting the Challenges of Business Intelligence for Small Enterprises, puts it: Continued success lies in getting everyone in the team on the same page by using the same set of assumptions based on the same version of the truth. When choosing a business intelligence solution, look for one that offers customizable permissions for reports and dashboards. Departments then have the freedom to control the relevant data they want to analyze while, at the same time, keeping them aligned with the companys KPIs. Any business intelligence application worth its salt will contain support for data connectors. Data is strewn across all the various tools and databases that your company uses. Whether its website data from Google Analytics, sales data from Salesforce, Facebook activity stats, or customer data stored in SQL databases, everything can be pulled together to help you get a meaningful picture of how your business performs. One of the biggest payoffs of a business intelligence solution is being able to spot relationships between data sets to analyze how different facets of the business combine to affect performance. You can spot trends and jump on opportunities based on the data you collect. Custom reports allow you to track performance in a particular area of the business (monthly sales figures, activity on social media channels, etc.). Its important when choosing a business intelligence application to consider if it supports automatized reporting, as this allows you to receive or send regular reports without having to generate a new report each time. Many top business intelligence apps offer , which lets you drill down even deeper into a report to get specific stats about accounts, transactions, or records. Predictive analysis support is another useful feature to look for in a business intelligence tool, as it allows you to forecast performance based on supposed changes in a certain area of the business with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Business intelligence software lets you create visualizations and dashboards to continuously real time data. Not only can these dashboards , they provide a familiar way for employees to access and interpret data. When choosing a business intelligence app, check to see if visualizations and dashboards are optimized to run on any device and are embeddable. Its very useful to be able to share dashboards so that they look and behave the same no matter what platform theyre being accessed on. Choosing the right app is a matter of paying attention to its features and making sure it includes everything you need to pull together all your data, analyze it, and visualize it in a way that suits you. The good thing is, many of these solutions offer free trials or demos, so you can get a feel for them before you make the decision to buy. Offering data integration, visual analytics, and predictive analytics, helps you structure your data to find meaningful patterns.

In fact, 86 percent said they dont use social media sites to get advice or information. Instead, theyre relying on search engines. According to the results released last month [emphasis mine]: And I think thats how the recent survey results should be taken  small business owners are still feeling their way in. Its not that social media isnt helpful. Its simply a learning curve. In truth, I actually think small business owners are among those doing social media the best. SMB owners simply know how to talk and engage their customers in ways that big businesses have forgotten. They know how to be human and relatable better than anyone. Where their struggle comes from is in the time investment involved in that initial learning curve. How do you manage the time element? Social media becomes a time suck when you dont have a purpose for what youre doing. When you havent created a social media plan and youre simply clicking around and engaging in every conversation you can get your hands on. Ideally, you want to list out what youre trying to accomplish with social media and then identify the actions that will help you achieve those goals.   You want to be able to so that you can keep tabs on what youre doing and determine what is or is not successful. You cant be everywhere. Its just not realistic. Instead, figure out where it makes sense for you to engage. Maybe thats Twitter. Or LinkedIn. Or a Delicious. Or a site thats only big in your community. Either way, focusing only on certain sites helps you to focus your efforts and get the most out of them.  Its always better to pick two or three sites that youll want to put a lot of energy into than diluting that among 15. Once you know your community is and where youll be spending your time, create rules for youll be engaging. What tone will you take? What will you say? How far can you go to fix someones problem? What types of conversations will you have? Outlining this beforehand will help you maximize your time when you do engage. Social media tools help make it appear like youre always there and engaging even when youre really not. The trick is to find the tools that work for what youre doing. For example, to manage your blogging, use a feed reader like to help you keep track of the conversation and prioritize blogs into different topics and importance levels.  If youre using WordPress, schedule posts in advance and use plugins to make your blog more social media-friendly. If youre using Twitter, use tools like , or to help you manage conversation and schedule tweets ahead of time. Use Google Alerts via either email or RSS to keep track of social media mentions. Spend some time building a strong now and youll put yourself in a better position to manage everything. In my experience, the companies that have a hard time with social media are the ones who try to sit on the fence.  They know they should engage, so they do.halfway. Theyre dipping their toes in without making it part of their day-to-day routine.  You need to schedule social media time the same way you schedule in all your other commitments.  It has to be given the same attention and priority.  By setting aside time to talk to people, to tweet fun things, to connect with your audience on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc, you help establish your presence and make it a real part of your organization.  Its important that you develop a consistence schedule so that users trust your presence. Those are some ways I think small business owners could do a better job leveraging social media to see ROI. What are your thoughts?","For Ajit G Nambiar, Chairman and Managing Director of BPL, June 2015 was a month of excitement and nervousness. BPLs new line of 32-inch televisions were going on sale on Flipkart and the one-time large appliances leader was about to see the unveiling of its first product in over 10 years. On the day of the launch, Ajit and his team of merry men were glued to their computer screens monitoring the customer response from BPLs Dynamic House office on Church Street, in the heart of Bengaluru. By end of day, the answer was clearBPL was back! Within a quarter of the launch, the five-decade-old company was contributing almost 10 per cent of sales in the television category for , and about five percent in overall appliances. BPL is now among the top three brands for Flipkart in the segments they operate in. It is one of our largest brand success stories, says Amit Bansal, Head of the large appliances category at , and the man responsible for bringing BPL on board. The partnership between Flipkart and BPL came about thanks to the lack of interest shown by Indias big-three consumer durable brandsLG, Samsung, and Sonyto try online retail. The big three didnt want to work with us. But we still needed to add value to our consumer. So how do we do that? This was the question Amit, who joined Flipkart in 2014 after spending about a decade in North America and then three years at Reliance Retail in India, had on his mind at the start of 2015. But, in true retail industry style, Amit backed up the crazy idea with market research on what consumers remember most about these brands. The core customer who buys large appliances is in the 30-35 or over-35 age group. Most of these customers said they had a TV or fridge or washing machine in their parents house that was BPL and still working well. Many even remembered their old tag line  Believe in the Best. It was very exciting to see that, recalls Amit. That is how Amit reached out to BPL and its Chairman Ajit in early-2015. . Once a market leader, BPL found itself unable to compete with then new entrants like LG, Sony, and Samsung in the 2000s. Battles within the family for control of the Group didnt help matters either. Its technology partner Sanyo was also in trouble and finally in 2006-07, BPL got out of the large appliances business. From then, BPL focused on its medical equipment vertical and the consumer electronics side focused on home automation products and solutions. But the rise of intrigued Ajit and he kept close tabs on the sector over the last couple of years. While it took a few meetings for the two companies to finalise the partnership, Ajit did not need convincing about the potential of the sector. When we stopped distribution, a lot of our dealers called us and told us they didnt understand why we stopped as the demand had not ceased. When we met Flipkart and Amit last year, we realised that online is now a better model and it was growing very fast. We decided we would get back with our brand, says Ajit. But getting back into appliance production was a completely different story. BPL had sold off most of its factories and the old local suppliers no longer existed. The world also had moved to outsourced production. This is where Flipkart stepped in. BPL and Flipkart had decided to do a trial run, with limited models and limited number of units. Large OEMs and suppliers typically do not supply such small numbers, but Flipkarts backing convinced the suppliers. BPL carved out a team from its home automation business and hired a few specialists. The BPL team worked very closely with the Flipkart team to come up with the specifications and features of the first television. But creating a product that fits customer requirements and making it available is only one part of online retail. Consumer appliances, even todays lightweight TVs, are not easy to transport to every nook and cranny of our vast country. Then, there is the added complication of installation and after-sales service. Flipkart had learnt of these issues the hard way. The e-commerce giant had first launched this category in 2012. But while sales were reasonably good, customer experience was adversely affected due to bad delivery, installation and after-sales service. Within a few months, Flipkart shut down this category. So, in 2014, when Flipkart decided to take a look at this category again, they went about building the supply chain part first. Flipkarts Amit says they realised pretty quickly that bulky goods cannot be shipped using the regular supply chain infrastructure. The company set up dedicated warehouses only for TVs and large appliances in , Kolkata, Delhi, and Mumbai. Also, the shipping is primarily handled by in-house logistics arm and a handful of specially selected platinum logistics partners. For installation and after-sales, Flipkart acquired , a startup offering appliance repair and maintenance service in late-2014. BPLs Ajit says such facilities help brands like his on the ground. With orders coming in from across the country, BPL works closely with the Jeeves team to ensure quick installations and resolutions to any customer complaints. We have weekly meetings with Jeeves and have a small window into their MIS. We ensure we are on top of things, says Ajit. With the success of the pilot, BPL has worked on its new range. A new 32-inch TV has already been launched and a 40-inch and a Smart TV are ready for launch. While televisions will be the focus segment, the company will also have a limited range of refrigerators, washing machines, and air-conditioners. We will first focus on building up the volumes, then marketing and investing in R&D and production, says Ajit. From being a legacy brand, BPL has now become a new-age online-only brand and Ajit sees this characteristic continuing. For both Flipkart and BPL, the collaboration has meant greater ambitions. With success stories like BPL, Vu and Sansui under its belt, Flipkart has set its sights on being the most dominant large-appliance online marketplace in the country. BPL, which was targeting Rs 50 crore from its first year of sales, has now revised the target to Rs 70 crore after seeing the initial response. This is the only thing the flagship company will be focussing on. That is how important the large appliances business is for BPL, says Ajit. And on what the consumer response to seeing BPL back means for him, Ajit says: I am overwhelmed.","Theres a revolution taking place  a mobile one. Today, everyone knows and understands that people continue to be more reliant on mobile devices for their immediate needs now more than ever. Mobile search is even expected to overtake desktop search in volume within the next year. Its immediately clear that mobile search is fast growing in popularity and value. But how much? Youre about to find out. is among one of Googles , letting advertisers attach clickable click to call links that automatically generate the businesss phone number on a users mobile device. Click-to-calls make it super easy for searchers to get in contact with a business in the least amount of time possible. According to Google, click-to-call is such a popular ad format that Google generates 30 million calls every month as of right now. If your small business relies on getting the phone to ring for orders and inquiries, consider looking into now. Searches on mobile devices are 66% more likely to have local intent than a desktop search. Meaning people searching on mobile phones are usually looking for something around them. For example, directions to a business or a phone number to call. Capitalize on strong local search intent by creating ads and landing pages that make it easier for searchers to call or find your business (see #4 below). In a recent with Surojit Chatterjee, the head of global mobile search ads at Google, Chatterjee said: Since mobile searchers are often trying to find a quick answer to a present problem, they have stronger intent and are much closer to making a purchase than a desktop searcher.If a mobile user is searching for emergency road side car service, then the user is probably in need of service right away. A user executing the same search at home, in the evening, is probably in no rush. So, depending on your business, mobile clicks may actually be more valuable than desktop clicks. Even though, historically, theyve been cheaper. Click-to-call extensions are a tremendous benefit for both users and advertisers. Mobile users can get in contact with businesses quickly and easily, without writing down numbers or navigating cumbersome mobile sites. Advertisers get better performing ads. Ads featuring the click-to-call extensions along with location extensions can see a 6-8% increase for click-through rates (which can subsequently raise your quality score, lower your costs and improve ad exposure). Okay, so I forced the statistic a little on this last one. But this is great news: Google recently began offering extensive call reporting free of charge. This granular call data was previously available for a fee of $1 per call. But Google has since decided to start providing this data for free. Ultimately, the only mobile search statistic that matters is the ROI (return on investment) for your small business. New detailed call reports show advertisers the phone numbers of various calls to the business, how long the phone calls lasted and what time the calls occurred.Its as simple as looking at a phone bill. This data can help businesses decide what time of day is most valuable for enabling click-to-call extensions, when to have more staff available to answer phones, etc. Measuring the ROI from mobile search is easier than ever. Everyone knows theres a mobile revolution happening. Mobile search is expected to overtake desktop search in volume within the next year and mobile advertising is getting both easier and better. The great news is that with Googles , developing a mobile search strategy for your small business is easier than ever.",Exclusive: first retail iPhone store to open in Germany next week (TheAppleBlog) Sonys sweet DSC-HX1 zooms into HD (NewTeeVee) The promise of algae fuel rests on Big Oil (Earth2Tech) LogMeIn Ignition gives you remote access from your iPhone (WebWorkerDaily) New Quickoffice version adds Office 2007 document editing (jkOnTheRun) Frankencamera: a far-reaching open-source camera project from Stanford (OStatic),"Beer might be one of the most popular beverages in the world , and one of the best times to drink it is on a hot summer day.

He focused on the tech sector where his experience was strongest. But instead of starting with a prototype for a product or service and then seeking funding, he started by getting on the phone with potential customers. That led to conversations about what kind of product they would buy. After a month of phone calls, Gianforte spent about 60 days coding the product his customers said they wanted.

What do you think drives entrepreneurs and small business people to choose their path? What makes an entrepreneur? What exactly are the traits that drive certain people to create something entirely new or build a business from the ground up rather than throw their efforts behind an established company? Are entrepreneurs leaders and employees just followers? Which type of businessperson are you?  could be a bike, a date, a kiss, or the impression you get when you visit a new Website or local business. Think about first experiences and how they shape our lasting impressions, then ask yourself some important questions about whether youre giving your audience or customers the best first experience possible. Chris Brogan ties it together in this insightful post about the impact of first impressions in business. ? Theyre not too different, since advertising on the internet and what people are saying about your business online can almost be the same thing or at least have the same effect: to attract new customers or to warn them away. But where can you get the most impact for your advertising dollar and how do you plan to budget in the coming year? ! With the shift in advertising from push to permission and the move away from traditional media and taste-makers to the diverse and niche, theres no one source to tell us what the best, safest, or most winning choice actually is.

In China's spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by two per cent from the central parity rate each trading day, Xinhua reported. The central parity rate of the yuan against the US dollar is based on a weighted average of prices offered by market makers before the opening of the interbank market each business day.

Participants included people like Joseph Weisenthal, Executive Editor of Business Insider; Matt Yglesias, who covers economics for Slate and Felix Salmon, finance blogger at Reuters. The topic was , the sites content has become wildly popular and viral on Facebook. Then, in the middle of the debate, Tony Haile, CEO of tweeted this: As a result, Hailes remark went a little viral in its own right. Hailes company measures real-time traffic on sites like Upworthy, so his announcement did carry considerable weight. If you run a blog or other site featuring regularly updated content, you probably assume social sharing is one of the best ways to get more people to read that content. So its a bit shocking to find that might not be the case.But thats not where the story ends. Sites like Upworthy and Buzzfeed have found that, yes, some people share without fully reading the article. But if someone actually does read to the end of a piece, theyre more likely to share on social media, . So that effectively means there are two kinds of social sharers. There are those who share without finishing the article. And there are those who share because they really read and consumed the entire article. Here at Small Business Trends, we find yet another wrinkle. We find there is often not a correlation between sharing and reading the article. Thats simply because those who consume an article may not be that active on social media. That is especially true with serious business topics. Some of the most popular articles here on Small Business Trends have surprisingly few social shares. Yet, some of the most highly shared articles havent been read nearly as much. Lesson: You cant always tell from the number of shares.","If youre a freelancer and looking to find out which skills are currently hot, it helps to look at freelance marketplace .

Or at least not quite as hot.  The number of Android mobile development jobs has overtaken Apple jobs. Why? Partly because Android is hot in Asia, and mobile is growing there. Mobile phone app development is strong, too. Game and app makers are obviously inspired by the phenomenal success of apps such as Flappy Bird and Candy Crush. Writing and content jobs have rebounded after declining a few years ago, in the wake of the carnage left by the Google Panda and Penguin algorithm updates.

U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (OR-3), who proposed the increase, claims the added cost is necessary to replenish the Highway Trust Fund to maintain the nations roads and bridges. To make matters worse, the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, has just released a report suggesting that current gas taxes and other fees are only sufficient to meet about half of current state and federal highway spending. Joseph Henchman, Tax Foundation vice president of state projects and the author of the report, : Henchman believes funding for road maintenance at the federal and state level should come from a mix of user fees including tolls, gas taxes, and other vehicle related fees. While infrastructure is certainly important, more added costs come at the worst possible time for already squeezed small businesses dealing with a challenging economy.Added fees and taxes hit small businesses in two ways. First, they can increase shipping costs for B2B or B2C businesses by increasing the costs for the carriers they use (like UPS). These carriers in turn eventually increase costs to compensate. Second, they can increase travel costs including regular long commutes if necessary for your business.(As an example, daily travel on a state toll road like the in Southeastern Pennsylvania can run thousands of dollars per year. And thats even with cost saving options like E-Z Pass for regular commuters. So any increase will be costly.) Whether or not any of these cost increases become a reality this year or in the future, its a good idea to begin looking at how they affect your bottom line. And, of course, its time to look for any options to cut these costs by making changes in your business today. Though not every option will work for every business, here are some ideas to explore: First, if applicable in your business, consider introducing digital products like ebooks and other downloads as opposed to physical books, discs, etc. This might also be a good solution for your customers who may become less eager to buy as shipping costs increase.If you ship other kinds of products or merchandise that cant be replaced with digital versions, examine your current shipping arrangements and start determining now whether there are any ways to cut costs. Second, introduce more telecommuting in your business. This could include looking at working more from a home office where applicable and even meeting with clients or customers via Skype or Google Hangouts. It might also include a more mobile set-up for your staff or team. Again, this wont work for every business, so youll need to look at your specific situation. You should also consider contacting your to let him or her know how increases in transportation costs would affect your business.","Can you believe that the first Web page is now more than twenty years old?

While no one plans for it happen to their business, companies can slip out of good standing, be placed in non-compliant status, administratively dissolved, or even revoked by the state where they formed. In addition, when a business is in bad standing, the business owners limited liability protection is lost, rendering their personal assets vulnerable to meet any debts or other obligations of the business. No matter how you got yourself into bad standing, it is possible to get back into good standing. And in many cases, its not nearly as hard as youd think. If you have a business in bad standing, read on to learn how to bring it back to good standing this summer. And if youre not in bad standing, the following can help you understand how to stay compliant in the first place. A corporation or LLC will fall into bad standing when it fails to meet the requirements of the state where it formed or where it has a foreign qualification. For example, a business may fail to file its annual report and pay its annual fees on time (in some cases, you would need to fail to file for several years in a row before going into bad standing). Another common culprit is when the Registered Agent resigns from representing the company (which often happens when the company forgets to pay the Registered Agent fees) and the company fails to set up a new agent of record. Additionally, if you fail to file your state franchise taxes, your business can fall out of good standing. If youre not sure how your business stands with the state, simply check with your states secretary of state office. The specific steps for reinstatement vary from state to state. Yet the general steps are typically: 1. Determine why your company fell out of compliance (if you dont already know this, you can check with the secretary of state office). 2. Submit a reinstatement form on behalf of the corporation or LLC to the secretary of state. 3. Pay any outstanding fees or fines (including overdue state franchise taxes). In some cases, you may need to file some additional documentationit all depends on why you fell out of compliance in the first place. When you reinstate your business, your corporation or LLC keeps the original filing date of formation. If your company fell out of good standing, it may be tempting to just start clean with a brand new business. However, while you may be starting fresh, the state is still keeping tabs on the original business. All unpaid fees, taxes and penalties will continue to accrue each year  even if youre no longer operating the business. Ultimately, the state may be able to place a levy on your personal bank account. For this reason, if your business is out of compliance or in bad standing, you need to take action to get it back in good standing. Reinstating your business means you can regain all the benefits of corporate/LLC status, including limited liability protection to safeguard your personal assets. Most importantly, you can keep running your business without worrying about an uncertain legal status.","Jill Salzman (pictured center above, in orange) was already a mom and an entrepreneur before she launched The Founding Moms Exchange in 2009. The mother of two was juggling multiple businesses, including a music management firm and a childrens accessory line. And she wanted a way to connect with other mom entrepreneurs. So she used the website to start a group in her hometown of Oak Park, Illinois. Moms would get together monthly to swap tips and collaborate with one another. Within 6 months of the initial gathering, the group had grown to over 200 members. Eventually, the group began to grow beyond the Oak Park meetup. Moms wanted to see groups set up in other cities. Salzman was happy to see the growth, telling : Now, Salzman oversees offline groups that meet in 43 different cities and 9 countries. The Founding Moms Exchange has over 8,000 members that participate in these groups. But Salzman has also expanded beyond the offline groups. Today, the group website includes podcasts, newsletters, and an online community where members can connect with other mom entrepreneurs. Membership to the site costs $37 per month. Salzman also monetizes her business through speaking engagements, books, and the Founding Kit, a service to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses. Entrepreneurship among mothers has been a growing trend for years. Often, these moms see a gap in the market that affects their own lives, and then choose to fill it themselves. In this case, Salzman wanted a way to get together with other entrepreneurial moms and didnt see an existing opportunity in her area. So she created one. As it happens, other moms were looking for the same thing. And thats why The Founding Moms has been able to grow to where it is today.","Have you ever wondered why some local businesses seem to be thriving by marketing themselves only on the Internet?

There is also the security of your customers and clients information to consider. However, in a recent attack on social media manager Buffer, something even more important may have been taken  many small business reputations with their communities. Buffer is a service that you to schedule social media posts across a variety of platforms including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn and get access to analytics that help you find the best times for those posts. So far so good. But recently, hackers apparently managed to gain access to more than 30,000 Buffer members accounts. Once in, they substituted a link to a weight loss site for the posts many Buffer users had already created and scheduled for their followers. The result was that many users ended up inadvertently spamming their own fans. Thats right  it looked to fans and followers as if these individual users had simply sent out spam posts to their communities. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Joel Gascoigne was quick to apologize and commiserate with members. On the official Buffer blog, Gascoigne : Before long, Gascoigne was able to report that the access used by hackers to penetrate Buffers security had been found and the glitch had been eliminated. The company does not believe any user data was compromised. Its great Buffers team was able to resolve the problem quickly. But its hard to imagine anything worse than inadvertently spamming your own community, eroding the trust it has taken you so long to build.","Youve heard that the Web has become more visualandgreatimages inyour business website are important. But those images may be the scourge of your website visitors. Images account for 1MB out of the 1.7MB the average web page contains. This might not be much of a problem for your visitors on desktop computers using high-speed Internet connections. However,if youre seeing or want to see increased traffic from mobile visitors, those images could be anissue. Image-heavy Web pages can take a long time to download. Visitors get frustrated andleave your site. You may haveimplementeda responsive Web design, thinking that solves all your mobile problems. And its true that a responsive Web design solves someproblems. It automatically arranges and displays your site elements to be viewed on smaller, narrowermobilescreens. But responsive Web design isnt the answer to everything. It doesnt necessarily solve the image download issue. Even with responsive design, many times those heavyweight images still aredownloaded anyway.

If you dont know anything about HTML code, a non-technical definition is: its a special language.

It is writtenlike this ( ): The Picture element is about responsive not responsive . To non-technical business people, that distinction may seem small. But when it comes to your sites performance on mobile devices, it could be significant.

The <picture> markup code tells Webbrowsers such as Firefox to load and display the right (read:smaller) images: Not all developers accepted the new Picture element at first. Ars Technicas story outlines the process that leaders in the Web development community went through to get to the point of where the <picture> elementstands today. Along the way there was even a successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo featuring a guitar-playing Weiss. But the issue now appearssettled, withthe new picture HTML element being adopted. The <picture> markup element is coming soon to a browser near you. By the end of 2014support for it is expected to be turned on by default in the Chrome and Firefox browsers. Opera isalso on the way.

But for small businesses the company may still be best known for its system. Its a box that offers data storage onsite starting as low as $200. Multiple devices can be linked to replicate multiple copies of your business data without the need for cloud storage. The reasons why your business might want to avoid cloud storage options vary these days, Matt Pahnke, Senior Marketing Manager Of Storage Products at Netgear told Small Business Trends in a recent interview. One is a concern over security in an era when like the National Security Administration (NSA) are common. Second, its true that while many cloud options than it will cost you in upfront investment for a system like ReadyNAS. However, another way to look at it is that, essentially, these companies hold your data hostage requiring on going payments to maintain access, Pahnke said. By contrast, Netgear offers a very different solution. Pahnke explained: The little boxes can serve a deceptively large amount of memory with the right upgrades, as much as 16 terabytes, the company claims. And though cloud storage is now being touted for its relative safety with redundancies to prevent data, ReadyNAS has some elaborate safeguards too. Multiple layers of data protection include the ability to remove data into a portable receptacle if necessary. Another protection is ReadyNASs system of multiple disc storage insuring that if one disc fails, data has been simultaneously saved to other that can take its place. The system also backs up data hourly and can restore computer memory to almost any previous time desired. Finally, with the ability toinstantly replicate the data on each box offsite, for example to another ReadyNAS box, customers have the ability to create dispersed redundant storage of their own much like the cloud, Pahnke said. In one example, he suggests a chain of five Subway restaurants with a ReadyNAS box in each store to collect data for each location. Then have one of the boxes located in your home or central office where you can replicate the data in all five locations in one location.","If theres an untapped area on the map of marketing, it surely is . Companies have dabbled in sending coupons and ads via text, urging customers to scan QR codes and placed advertisements at the bottom of mobile apps. While many of these havent succeeded long-term, theres one thing we cant deny: people use their phones to find local retailers. The days of the Yellow Pages being the primary source for local vendors may be limited: 79% of smartphone users now use their phones to help with shopping, says Google. This presents many opportunities for local retailers, restaurants and service providers, as getting to the top of search results on mobile is a highly coveted prize.

You can then check out the map to see where the business is located, or even tap the hyperlinked phone number to call the company instantly. Googles mobile version shows fewer AdWords results, which can make it difficult to compete for that space. Explains Aman Devgan, VP of Products at Web.com: Users of the SmartCalls service gain access to their Scorecard, which provides lead alerts, call tracking and call recordings. The value here focuses on geo-targeting results. If youre looking for a restaurant while youre on the go, you want one close by, not across town. And with , businesses advertising with increase the chance of drawing local new customers. You certainly could set up your own AdWords Mobile account, but there are Google AdWords partners for a reason: small businesses often dont have the savvy skills to choose the right keywords at the right price, with ad copy that will turn searchers into customers. I know many small businesses who have tried to run their own AdWords campaigns, only to bleed money without seeing the ROI. Working with a partner like SmartCalls may take some of the guesswork out of the process.","Google announced a major change in one of its popular ad listings.

SoftLayer, based in Dallas, Texas, claims to be the worlds largest privately held hosting company. It has 25,000 customers, many of them large customers like AT&T. GI Partners purchased the equity in partnership with the companys management in August 2010. According to a , IBM plans to create a new division for clients interested in so-called cloud services, a move to better compete with larger rivals in the space. Senior vice president of IBM Global Technology Services Erich Clementi says the acquisition is aimed at serving larger clients. As businesses add public cloud capabilities to their on-premise IT systems, they need enterprise-grade reliability, security and management. To address this opportunity, IBM has built a portfolio of high-value private, public and hybrid cloud offerings, as well as software-as-a-service business solutions, said Clementi in the official announcement. With SoftLayer, IBM will accelerate the build-out of our public cloud infrastructure to give clients the broadest choice of cloud offerings to drive business innovation. However, our own experience shows how small businesses needing to scale growth may benefit from the resources IBM and SoftLayer together bring to the table. It all depends, though, on IBMs approach to smaller customers post-acquisition. It remains to be seen whether IBM will value small business customers or move away from them. SoftLayer is the hosting company for Small Business Trends (this publication) and certain of our cloud applications, such as BizSugar, and our proprietary Awards platforms. I have to believe were among the smaller customers, says Anita Campbell, CEO of Small Business Trends. So far that has suited us just fine. Over the years weve had a number of bad experiences with hosting companies whose target market is small businesses. Sure, they were inexpensive. But lack of responsive service and unreliability were key issues. We had one hosting company show us the door, because we needed service but the company was charging a cut rate and didnt want to spend any time on us. So for our larger sites we deliberately aimed up at a hosting provider used to serving larger customers, even though we paid a bit more. Service has been reliable, and weve had access to sophisticated monitoring tools. However, she notes, Were taking a wait and see attitude as to the direction IBM takes the company in. Will they move away from standard hosting, especially for small businesses, to pursue their larger vision of cloud services for big enterprises? Thats an open question in my mind. Lance Crosby, founder of SoftLayer, sent an email notice to existing customers saying it would be business as usual.

The application aims to create an alternative to fuller featured presentation software like PowerPoint. The idea is that fewer features might actually make it easier to create presentations by not overwhelming users with so many options. But the concept didnt come to Tratt and his team until they were trying to dissect a business idea that went wrong, Tratt told Small Business Trends in a recent Skype conversation. Tratt says: Fresh from a job with , now owned by Hasbro, Tratt was working on a Facebook celebrity game featuring rapper .(Yeah, it ended up pretty much like youd expect.) But what he came away with in analyzing the startups missteps was the realization that the hardest part had been creating a presentation on the dominant format, Microsofts PowerPoint.

Last week a new iPad version was released with translations in seven additional languages besides English and the ability to change the color of the text being used on the slides. The app is free with added presentation themes offered for an added cost. Tratt says Haiku Deck is already being used by attorneys, realtors, sales people and entrepreneurs.","Nokias new Lumia 1520 may be a big investment.

You should see it translated like this: Video image thumbnail may override your authorship photo in search: It may preserve and show your by Author Name part or it may remove it. I am seeing the latter more often recently: I have no data as to which picture (author photo or video thumbnail) will result in higher click-through, so its worth experimenting. It may depend on user intent. People who are more interested in watching a video tutorial, for example. Also note that the image thumbnail is larger and may stand out more in SERPs. Review schema markup has been largely abused (many people are using the markup without having the actual review and rating ability on the page). Google does that the rich mark-up should be representative of the main content of the page otherwise its misleading. Keeping the above in mind, I wouldnt suggest using any plugins that add review markup across the board. allows you to enable the markup on case-by-case basis. So you can show the markup only when you are actually reviewing a product or a service. Review schema may override your authorship markup but if you are using itemprop=reviewer, the reviewers name will appear in search. Ive seen cases where rel=author works the same way even when there is no itemprop=reviewer markup. But its better to set up the /review schema properly. In-depth articles have been this year. It remains very vague as to who qualifies to be ranked in in-depth section of SERPs. To be considered you need to set up the combination of schema types (most important) + + (only if your content is paginated) + or Basically, setting up two Schema types: /Article and /Organization. An image thumbnail will override your authorship picture. Note that unlike with the above cases, you are not sacrificing anything as the In-depth section is not replacing your search listing. Its an added benefit. Rich snippets still have a long way to go. Google is still figuring out what to display, how to better meet searchers needs and how to prevent abuse. But being an early adopter always pays off.","Small business owners frequently do not have the capital to pursue new venues, and they can find it difficult to secure loans from banks.

It recently became the second largest software services firm in the country, leaving behind several of its biggest rivals.  As per Senior Cognizant sources, this shuffle had nothing to do with the financial performance statements issued over the weekend; instead, it was being planned for quite some time now.

But what business owners may not realize is that using consumer televisions for commercial purposesmay void or reduce the warranty. And if you decide to use a TV or computer monitor to run an in-house presentation, say in your lobby, it can be cumbersome and expensive. You may need to commissionan expensive video or multimedia presentation. Or if you choose to createit yourself, such as with PowerPoint, the result may look less visuallyappealing than youd hoped. And what about signs and displays in your business? Have you ever wished for something more dynamic and exciting? Recently we ran across an impressivesolution for small businesses that solves those kinds of issues. Its called the . Think of it as TV and digital signage in a box. I saw it in action at the recent Small Business Summit in New York (pictured in the booth below). Overall, its an impressive package that gives small businesses the kind of flexibility and options for signage and television previously available to larger buyers (such as hotels, hospitals or retail chains). Michael OHalloran, marketing manager with Samsung,who was at the Summit, told me that this is a solution Samsung designed specifically for small businesses. Digital signage has been around for years, he said. But up to now its been for large companies. The difference is that weve created the first television and digital signage package in a box thats easy enough for even the smallest business to install and use. The Samsung SMARTSignage TV is designed specifically for small businesses. With it you can offerregular television programming to your patrons, of course. It is a fully functioning high-definition TV.Itcomes in two sizes: 40-inch and 48-inch. But the real beauty of this system is the digital sign platformthat is included at no extra charge. You can create and display bright, eye-catching digital signs in your premises. It includes a freesoftwarepackagecalled MagicInfo Express ( ), that comes with over 200 sign templates.After a short learning curve, it takes just minutes to create dynamic signs with text and images. You can have static signs or make the sign images move, alternate, fly in or fade out. There are many animation options to catch a customers eye. You can also schedule signage for different times of day. For instance, a restaurant could change a menu sign for breakfast, lunch and dinner automatically. You dont need to be a designer to use the software. Just upload your logo and photographs. Then you follow the instructions to insert them into the pre-made templates. You update the software from a laptop or desktop computer, or from a mobile device. Once satisfied with your design, you can load thecontent wirelessly to the television set from your computer or mobile device. This means, if you have signs at multiple locations, you can update them remotely. Another option is to upload via a USB device that youplug into the TV. You do notneed to be a technician to set upthe system. The media player is built in to the television. So theres no messing around trying to get a separate media playerto play nice with the TV. You dont have to jerry rig solutions such as running cables from a monitor to a dedicated laptop hiddennearby. Samsung televisions aregood quality and look attractive. The Smart Signage TV has a sleek gloss-black finish. These televisions are designed to takeheavy business use  16 hours per day, 7 days a week. Theyeach have an 16:9 LED Backlit LCD display. They areEnergy Star rated for energy efficiency. The signage TV is in use in New Yorks , where owner Christopher Pugliese pointsout that hes using the signto open up new sales opportunities. We have massive lines of 20-somethings who work all over New York City. And I dont think any of them realize thatwe could cater theiroffice breakfast or meeting, he said. We felt that the digital display would be really helpful with getting that message across. I saw a live demonstration, including how to use the software, at a conference. It presented very well (see Tompkins Square Bagels examples pictured). It appears as easy to use as the description. There were no negatives that I could see. My only reservation is that I havent used the Smart Signage TV for any length of time. So I cant speak to installingit or using it over time. (Read: .) However, I am a user of Samsung televisions in general. If the quality of these is similar to what I have used, you will be well satisfied with the looks, reliability and display. While there may be sharperdisplays on the market, the SMART Signage TV isa vast improvement overwhat I see many small businesses using today. SMART Signage TV is ideal for small businesses that want to attract customer attention through bright, eye-catching digital signs for interior spaces. This includes retail shops, spas, salons, restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques and bars. Its perfect to call out visually-appealing offerings or sales promotions, so you cansell more products or services. And remember that its also a TV. For those of you already offering business TV programming topatrons, it opens up new cross-selling opportunities. For example, a dentists office can provideTV in the waiting room. On a split screen the dentist could inform patients aboutoptional services such as invisible braces or tooth whitening. Its also a good choicefor offices that have television and/or in-house presentations in their lobbies. Examples include consulting businesses and technology companiesthat receive visitors regularly. Samsung SMART Signage TV isgreat for do-it-yourselfowners and managers who want the flexibility to change signage regularly  evenmultiple times a day. Playing around with the software, I can say it is easy to change signs using the templates. Id equate it to using PowerPoint. If you or your staff use PowerPoint, Im pretty sure you can learn to use this sign software. Who its not for: if you use business television but have no plans to ever use the signage, you may notget full value at the $749 and $999 price points. Price shoppers strictly looking for an inexpensiveTV who dont need the signage option can find cheaper options, I am sure. Remember, though,the warranty coverage with this SMART Signage TV may save you money in the long run. Small businesses that want to serve customers betterANDincrease sales should check out for an:","Recently,Google made a change to the algorithm to help improve the accuracy and relevancy of local results. To be clear, the algorithm was and not Google, but the change happened nonetheless. When Google comes up with a name for the algorithm, well update you right away. For now, the algorithm was significant enough to earn its own animal. Although we still dont know how many companies were affected, we do know that overall, local businesses are seeing either increases or decreases in website referrals and traffic. The idea is to offer local search results that are more closely related to some of the ranking signals they use in Web search as well as other features like the Knowledge Graph, synonyms, etc. The Google Pigeon algorithm change is also said to improve distance and location parameters, so local search should be more accurate overall. The Google Pigeon update was officially launched July 24, so there has been a little bit of time now to really analyze what has changed and whether or not the update was significant. For local businesses it is significant, and fortunately in a good way. Local directories are specifically getting the most benefit out of the change. In the past, when you would search for something local, you would get your carousel results and then a list of organic results, typically individual restaurants. Now, you will sometimes see directories showing up in the search results below the carousel including OpenTable, Urbanspoon, and even TripAdvisor. This doesnt happen with every search query, but were seeing it more and more so this may be a trend for the future (or something Google is trying). Below is a screenshot example of a query with local directory results. For this particular query (and with many other examples), an individual restaurant didnt show up in organic results until page two. If you were to continue scrolling down this page, you would see results from Zagat, Yelp, and even Groupon: Again, this is only the case for some search results. Its also worth mentioning that the Yelp ordeal has been solved with this change. Last week we about some of the confusion with Yelp and Google, essentially reporting that Yelp wasnt showing up on search results even when the word yelp was used in the search query. In other words, Google was accused of putting their own local results first even when they werent the most relevant. Since the new update, this is no longer the case and Search Engine Land gives several . As discussed above, if youre a directory this is a good thing. However, other local businesses may suffer. Keep in mind the goal of this Google Pigeon algorithm update  to tie local results more closely to standard Web ranking signals. With this in mind, its those sites that have solid and strong SEO signals that are going to prevail. Directories generally do outrank individual companies in this area, so local businesses are going to have to work harder to come out on top. Currently this update was only rolled out to US English results, and so far thats about all we know. We dont know when Google plans to roll Google Pigeonout to other countries (if at all), and we dont know the percent of queries impacted. Were hoping the details will come soon and we will keep you updated. In the meantime, check out your own metrics and let us know if youve seen any changes and what you think of the Google Pigeon update.","If you like pizza, theres not much about the pizza eating experience that needs to be improved. But if you arecommitted torecycling and sustainability, there is at least one area that you might say could use some work  pizza boxes. Pizza boxes are cumbersome and require a lot of finagling to fit into refrigerators and standard trashcans. Plus, theyre not the most eco-friendly packaging options. And thats where the world of green packaging solutions comes into play. Theres a new option out there for environmentally conscious pizza parlor owners and pizza lovers. is an innovative new type of pizza box that does more than just store a pizza. From the outside, it looks like a pretty normal pizza box. But the top of the box is actually perforated so users can tear out four serving plates. That eliminates the need for paper plates, which means less waste. In addition, the box is made from 100 percent recycled and recyclable corrugated cardboard. And if you still have some leftovers, the bottom half of the box has the ability to fold in half and store the remaining pizza slices in a more compact format. GreenBox President Jennifer Wright the Huffington Post that the company originally envisioned the concept for things like birthday parties and picnics. But they soon learned that GreenBox also appeals to people throwing office parties or those who like to enjoy some pizza at their desk while working late. Thats likely because traditional pizza boxes are even less likely to fit in shared office refrigerators than they are in home refrigerators. And who wants to cart a whole pizza box home after a long day? Currently, the boxes are sold to several pizza box distributors throughout the country including Performance Food Group and U.S. Foods. Some well-known brands like Whole Foods carry the boxes in stores. So GreenBox solves several problems for pizza eaters in an innovative way. Easy to fold boxes make leftovers easier to store and the boxes easier to dispose of conveniently. A perforated lid means no real need for paper plates, hence less paper and cardboard waste overall. And the fully recyclable boxes mean what does get thrown is ultimately less harmful to the environment. So for restaurant owners concerned with providing green packaging solutions, the Green Box helps meet the commitment toward providing a recyclable box. Not many pizza outletshave begun using this type of box yet. But for those businesses and consumers towhom environmental concerns arean everyday commitment,GreenBox can help with a green packaging solution. And it may just provide a competitive edge with itsinnovative approach. In a market where it can behard to distinguish between one pizza restaurant versus another, an innovative box gives consumers a reason to choose, while helping the environmentally conscious feel better about their choice.","Critics have charged that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) has been used as a tool of abuse. Fraudulent claims of copyright infringement have beenamajor problem with the DMCA Act, according to some. However, a recent California district court ruling is a step in the right direction to finallyput alid on fraudulent DMCA takedown requests. Or at least, thats what observers are hoping for. The case, called Automattic vs. Steiner, awarded over $25,000 in damages against a group that filed anunfoundedDMCA takedown request. It puts some teeth in the law, because its one of the few, maybe only, times damages have actually beenawarded against abusers. Enacted in 1998, the DMCA requires Web content to be taken down if it infringes on someone elses copyright. Theres certainly a good side to theDMCA. The Act helps a content owner whosecontent has been stolen or republished without permission. It quickly forces removal of plagiarized or infringing content. But what if you are on the receiving end  and havent done a thing wrong? Unscrupulous competitors or people with an ax to grind have played dirty attimes. They have used the law to harass or get back at their enemies or try to censor views they dont agree with. Theydo this bylodging unfounded infringement claimsin the form ofDMCA takedown requests. Social platforms like YouTube, hosting companies and search engines have to follow the law. They may have no choice but to take down the content, remove itfrom search results, or suspend Web pages. What makes it seem so unfair is that this can happen without the site owner having achance to defend against or refute claims, until after the fact. Its as if aneighbor you have a beef with could call the police to close down yourbusiness, merely on his or her say-so. Then the burden is on you to somehow prove that you didnt do anything wrong, and get it up and runningagain. Its all because of the waythe DMCAlaw is written. , Googles own data supports how the DMCA is being used as a commercial bludgeon: And the numbers of takedown notices havesoared in recent years. Google publishes a of DMCA takedown requestsit gets. This graph shows the growth of the number of infringement claims just in the past fouryears: Google says in the last month alone,it received notices onover 36 million URLsthatallegedly link to infringing content. Under the law, Google doesnt get to decide whether the claimis baselessor not. It can onlydetermine whether the notice on its face meets the DMCAsrequirements. If it does, Google de-indexes the content. And it does so fast  within six hours on average. On its Copyright Center, Google : In other words, if its your website or Web page thats been de-indexed without good reason, itsyour problem. You maybe forced intothe expense and hassle of taking the complaining party to court  instead of the other way around as our legal system normally requires. While all of that is happening, yourenowhere to be found in Google. Youre losing business. And its not just search results you have to be concerned about. Blogging platforms and social mediaplatforms also have taken down blogs, videos and other content. Hosting companies also are subject to the DMCA. They too have been known to suspend pages or even entire sites. (Plagiarism Today the process.) Over at TechDirt, a site coveringcopyright issues, hardly a week goes by without anew story about . Some are breathtakinglybrazen. Thats what makesthe Automattic vs. Steiner case so interesting. The case, decided in March 2015, held that someone filinga knowingly unfoundedDMCA takedown requestis liable for the other parties expenses and damage. Liabilityfor damages has always been in the DMCA law. That part is not new. What is new is that this case is one of the raretimesa court has actually granted a substantial dollaramount. Jack Greiner, a lawyer with the Cincinnati-based Graydon Head law firm who writes forEnquirer Media in First Amendment and media issues, the decision as the first and most clear explanation of the available damages. In the case, Nick Steiner, an official with a group called Straight Pride UK, sent a press release to a blogger who had requestedinformation. The blogger incorporated parts of the press release into an unfavorable blog post. Steiner then issued a DMCA takedown request to WordPress.com, where the blog was hosted. Automattic Inc, which runs WordPress.com, effectively said Weve had it up to here with these unfoundedDMCA claims. After all, the information used in the blog was from a press release. By its very nature the information was intended for third parties to use. So Automattic Inc. filed suitin U.S. District Court in California. In March, U.S. District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton a judgment in favor of Automattic and the blogger for their expenses and time spent fighting the takedown notice. Straight Pride UK no longer seems to exist, however. Therefore, the $25,000 awarded to the plaintiffs maynever be collected. Still,the ruling sets a rare precedent against attempts to use the [DMCA] to take content offline, the Guardian . What does it mean for entrepreneur bloggers and small business website owners? First, this court case may make unscrupulous competitors and grudge holders stop and think before filing unfounded DMCA takedown requests. If requests are not based on justifiable reasons, it couldcost the fraudsters in damages. Second,because a big player like WordPress.com decided to weigh in, it meansmore small businessesmay have allies to fight fraudulent claims.

And apparently Facebooks caught on. The company now recommends that developers turn off automatic posting and replace such posts with more purposeful, manual posting options.

These options provide either a manual share button (like on Instagram) or Facebooks new message dialog box (which allows users to share content from apps in conversation threads on Facebook, as seen above) within mobile apps. Besides changing its guidelines for explicit sharing, Facebook has added two new ways for to integrate Facebook into their apps.

And its being led by YOU. ~Mark Schaefer, Return On Influence I discovered Mark Schaefers ( ) latest book, , while glancing through my Twitter feed one day. Mark is considered an authority on marketing and social media. Ironically, Mark also wrote the bestselling book, The Tao of Twitter (which has just been updated) so its really not a surprise that I became acquainted with the book on Twitter. The title of the book immediately grabbed my attention. So much so that I invited Mark to be a guest on my internet radio show and received a copy of the book through the publisher. After the show and talking with Mark, I realized even more so how important this book is for CEOs, presidents and business owners to read. With the world and technology both changing so fast, business is changing too, right before our eyes. So fast we may not even realize how much or to what extent. My advice to everyone running a company is: Dont get left behind. One way to do that is to read Mark Schaefers book, Return On Influence. The word, influence, is mentioned quite often lately. Have you noticed? In the forward to the book, I learned that the idea of influence is rooted in astrology. Centuries ago, the Gauls started using the word influence to explain the actions of people saying that it lay in the stars. Fast forward to modern society and influence has taken on a whole new meaning with the phrase, under the influence. Today due to the digital age we live in the word, influence continues to make a transition in its meaning. For three distinct reasons: Mark Schaefer refers to it as influence marketing. It brings fresh meaning to the classic Dale Carnegie book, How to Win Friends and Influence People. Now anyone can be influential as long there is relevance. The book is divided into two parts. Part 1 explores: The Roots of Influence. The chapters cover such topics as the rise of the citizen influencer  how its the end of an era for mass marketing and the rise of a generation reclaiming their consumer voice. No longer is influence only for the politicians and celebrities. The Internet now gives us the opportunity to be super-connectors far beyond our circle of family, friends and work associates. An especially interesting section in Part 1 of the book discusses the weapons of influence using Dr. Robert Cialdinis, six weapons of influence model as a basis to illustrate differences. The author contrasts the role of authority, likeability, consistency and scarcity in both the online and offline worlds. Weapons of influence include social proof and reciprocity as well as badges for our information-dense society such as the number of Twitter followers. Schaefer names a seventh weapon which is content. As it states in the book: Yes, content is king if used properly within a marketing and social media strategy. The rise of influence marketing includes social influence scoring which is beginning to permeate through business, human resources and our personal lives. Social scoring takes the traditional meaning of having klout to a whole new level. This is what Schaefer examines in Part 2 of his book: The Social Scoring Revolution. He focuses especially on Klout.com  how it came to be, its controversies and benefits. For those who may not be familiar with Klout, it is considered the leader in social influence measurement. I must admit that since reading this book and talking with Mark, I am much more aware of what my Klout score is. You should be too. Chapter 10 will tell you how to increase your Klout score. The author talks about a revolution in marketing. This is it. Make sure your company is part of the revolution. Otherwise, customers may no longer view your company as relevant to their needs. Mark Schaefer, according to his official bio, is among the top 5% of all influencers on Twitter, has done his homework in researching the book. He interviewed 50 experts and industry thought leaders including Influence author Robert Cialdini. There are more than a dozen marketing case studies in the book to reference. Plus practical, actionable tips to increase your own power and influence online For years now the standard question in marketing to determine if a campaign is effective or not is often based on ROI  return on investment. Today, that is changing. Mark Schaefers book is certainly proof of that. Meet the new definition of ROI. Its now return on influence. Welcome to the future of marketing its already arrived.","Small business owners face constant changes. Over the past year, many may have dealt with the effects of the health care industry evolving, the ups and downs of the economy, even employees circumstances changing. Here are four health insurance trends that may help small business leaders as they prepare for the year ahead. Health insurance exchanges are now part of the employee benefits equation and for small businesses especially, these options can provide numerous advantages. Privately run exchanges are and are expected to surpass enrollment in the government exchanges. These online private marketplaces have grown in popularity because they can offer a mix of benefits products and help reduce an employers time spent on administration and paperwork. And regardless of your size, private exchanges can help your company offer a variety of benefits options. Additionally, government exchanges can offer tax advantages for certain small businesses  making them an increasingly common option. Controlling costs is always a top priority for small businesses. In fact, 53 percent say its one of their top business objectives.So when it comes to rising health care costs, its no surprise many are looking to adopt cost-saving strategies whenever possible. In 2014, 24 percent of small employers expected to increase employees share of premiums, and 24 percent expected to increase employees co-pays. However, shifting costs to employees can have an adverse effect. Employees at small businesses say if their employers shift an increasing portion of health insurance costs to them, then it would have at least a moderate impact on their job satisfaction and likelihood to consider looking for a new job. Thats why many employers will be considering ways to save on health care costs while still protecting their workforce. For example, the defined contribution benefits model is gaining consideration since it is a way for employers to control the amount they pay towards benefits while still giving employees the ability to spend on the health care options they feel are most important. A couple of other health insurance trends to keep an eye on include high-deductible health plans tied to health savings accounts and changes in spouse coverage. Theres no substitute for the conversations an employee can have with a benefits professional, but that doesnt mean there arent benefits to streamlining some of your administration processes. From 2011 to 2014, employees using online enrollment methods at small businesses increased by 62 percent. Other popular methods, including paper and face-to-face enrollment, saw very little change for small businesses during the same period. Most employees at small businesses appear to be happy with the shift: more than 9 in 10 (93 percent) say theyre at least somewhat satisfied with their current enrollment method. Embracing technology for benefits enrollment can offer a more convenient process for employees and help reduce time wasted on mistakes with paper forms. Consider online options as a complement to your already successful face-to-face communication methods. Employees are gaining new found benefits choices, but many arent prepared to take on increasing out-of-pocket health care costs. the Health Research Institute (HRI) at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the average premium increase across all states in 2015 will be 6 percent.Yet, salary increases are to reach 3 percent.These pressures, coupled with the fact that a majorityof employees who work for small businesses (70 percent) at least somewhat agree they wouldnt be able to adjust to the large financial costs associated with a serious injury or illness, prompt a need for strong financial safety nets. One way employers can help protect their employees is by adding voluntary insurance benefits to their employee benefits packages. These benefits help provide an extra layer of financial protection by paying cash benefits directly to the policyholder if they get sick or injured and are a way to offer a broader benefits package to your workforce. Not to mention, employees who are offered and enrolled in voluntary benefits are 37 percent more likely to say their current benefits package meets their familys needs extremely or very well than those who arent offered voluntary benefits through their employer. Every small business has its unique needs, but reviewing health insurance trends for the coming yearcan help build a strong foundation for the future. Consider best practices for these trends that can work for your small business, and head into the future on the right foot.","Newly sworn-in Small Business Administration Chief Maria Contreras-Sweet may want to give small businesses access to more loans. But a bigger challenge may be adding some oversight to the administrations current troubled loan guarantee program. Critics like the Government Accountability Office (GAO) say the program is already costing taxpayers billions. And thats bad for everyone, small businesses included. Contreras-Sweet was formally sworn in to her post earlier this week after being in a vote by the U.S. Senate in May. She replaces former SBA head Karen Mills, who resigned as administrator in February 2013. During her confirmation hearings, Contreras-Sweet the importance of getting small businesses access to more financing. That would include SBA guaranteed loans in which the agency backs about 85 percent of the money put up by private lenders. If a borrower defaults, the SBA will still pay the private lender up to the amount of the guarantee to reduce the overall risk. For example, the SBA saw a 28 percent default of franchise loans backed by the agency between 2003 and 2012 costing taxpayers at least $1.5 billion, Bloomberg . Over that same period, bad loans granted through the Patriot Express program have cost taxpayers $31 million. The program is designed to speed the loan process for military veterans. The SBAs own inspector general even noted that the agency doesnt properly assess risk when granting loans. In a separate report, the GAO says that many of the loans granted through Patriot Express may not even be going to veterans or their families. The GAO expressly the SBAs oversight of this program. It said that a lack of oversight will continue to direct loan money to non-veterans. The SBAs ability to bring financing to small businesses is an important function to be sure, as is the agencys advocacy for the small business community. But it is also imperative that the agency get its own lending programs under control for the benefit of all taxpayers, including the small business community it seeks to serve.","Twitter recently relaunched its revamped site as a way to again show businesses the power of a Twitter presence. Businesses, it turns out, need little encouragement. A by email marketing provider Constant Contact shows an increasing number of small businesses see the value of Twitter, 25 percent today versus just 7 percent in May 2012. If you havent done much with Twitter lately or arent sure of its true potential for business, below are 10 reasons you should boost your Twitter presence.  The study cited above isnt the only evidence small business use of Twitter is on the rise.

In his post, Juckes writes about the way Twitter has replaced carefully regulated communication with quick, on the spot analysis. In marketing parlance, this might be described as buzz. Though caution must be taken when tweeting and when acting upon what is being tweeted, it remains an excellent way to take the pulse of an industry. ~ While marketing is certainly a possibility, social media consultant Michelle Prak suggests Twitter can more effectively be used to network with peers to be a thought leader in your industry. Leave Facebook for longer, insider stories, talking with your fans or making special offers and promotions. Twitter, she says, is for your inner circle. Use it to leverage your connections. ~ The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this week approved disclosures on Twitter and Facebook from publicly held corporations. The approval is contingent upon investors being told in advance, reports Joshua Gallu. Though most small businesses certainly dont fall under the regulations governing publicly held companies, this is a sign that Twitter is quickly becoming a channel for business. Especially if you operate in the B2B market, this also means your customers are here. ~ According to Gartner research, Twitter and other social media channels will be as common as phone or email in dealing with customers by 2014.

But the was eventually taken back due to public backlash. It kept parcel package delivery going on the weekend. Well, it now seems to have worked out for the best, as Amazon announced recently that it has teamed up with the U.S. Postal Service to offer parcel shipping to select Amazon Prime customers on Sundays. In a release from the online retailer announcing the new service, Postmaster General and Postal Service CEO Patrick R. Donahue : The new service is being offered only in New York and Los Angeles at first. However, a roll-out next year is planned for other major cities in the U.S., including Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix. Millions of products will be eligible for Sunday delivery to Amazon.coms Prime customers who receive free two-day delivery just for their membership. The new service means Amazon Prime customers who order a product Friday wont need to wait until Monday to receive it. When checking out after making an order, members will simply see the Sunday delivery notification if applicable in their area. The new arrangement would seem to be a shot in the arm for the Postal Service as it struggles to remain viable and competitive against private rivals UPS and FedEx. But its also another step in Amazons efforts to become an ever more viable competitor to traditional offline shopping options. Sunday delivery is also good news for small businesses that work with Amazon as a major means of selling their products and for affiliate marketers who offer links to Amazon goods on their sites. Many other small businesses still use the U.S. Postal Service for their own deliveries as the only means to reliably reach every address in the nation. These small businesses wont be able to get their packages delivered on Sundays.","Business regulators in Europe believe that Google is violating antitrust rules there by forcing its Shopping results on users. Heres a deeper look at the Google antitrust case and why EU regulators decided to act. In April, the European Competition Commission filed antitrust charges against Google. The EU says Google is moving its own shopping listings to the top of search results, thereby giving it an unfair advantage in the online marketplace. According to NPR, the charges filed by the EU against Google are focused on product searches. Companies that advertise with Google can get their shopping results displayed higher up in Google searches, the EU says. And that means Google is manipulating its search results to favor its advertising business, because, well  it can. But not for long in Europe, if EU regulators have their way. Officials there believe that putting Googles placement of paid results above other search results constitutes an unfair advantage because Google also controls the majority of overall search done online. Thus, in most cases searchers will be using Google to find the products they need and Google is giving advantage in those searches to businesses that pay it for the privilege to advertise. In a statement by NPRs All Things Considered, EU Competition Commission Chair Margrethe Vestager said: Vestager recently Marketplace.org that Europeans should expect to get the best search results possible to their inquiries. And those expected search results should not be skewed by what Google wants displayed more prominently over the best results. While the current scope of the investigation against Google is narrowed on just product results, the New York Times that the EU is considering levying the same charges against Google for restaurant and hotel search results. And after (or during) its volley of accusations against the search giant, the EU is also expected to zero in on the Android mobile operating system. To Googles credit, its dominance in Europe is remarkable. Data gathered by Stat Counter shows that Google has a 92 percent market share of all Internet searches in Europe. And 71 percent of all mobile users in Europe do so on an Android device. While admitting shes a fan of Google searches, Verstager says the company is abusing its position in the marketplace by giving an unfair advantage to its advertisers.","largely from U.S. investors to increase its presence in the U.S. market. Now the cloud accounting firm says its seen a 200 percent increase in customers heresince 2013. The actual number of customers is still pretty small  just 18,000 in North America. Thats compared to much bigger numbers in Australia and its native New Zealand. The annual report for the companys fiscal year ending March 31 was released this week. Company heads said they are committed to growing their business here focused on the small business market. In the report, Chief Executive Rod Drury and Chairman Chris Liddell : New leadership added this year to aid the expansion includes Liddell, who the company calls its independent New York-based chairman of the board. Liddell formerly served both as Vice Chairman and CFO at General Motors and as Senior Vice President and CFO at Microsoft.

You should consider the following three questions to make more informed decisions for your workforce. Its commonly agreed upon by both employers and employees that health benefits play a significant role in employee satisfaction. In fact, according to the 2013 Aflac WorkForces Report, 78 percent of employees say their benefits package is important to their job satisfaction, and 65 percent say it is important to employer loyalty. Deciding whether or not youll offer coverage to your workforce is a choice that affects more than just your bottom line; it also affects employee morale and retention. View employer-sponsored benefits options as a cost-effective way to boost employee compensation. If you are an employer with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees, you will not be penalized for not offering a health plan. But you should, nonetheless, keep in mind the qualitative and quantitative values of benefits: Before you move ahead in making benefit options available to your employees, you will need to assess what you can actually afford to invest. If you provide your workforce with employer-sponsored benefit options, you may already have this cost budgeted for the coming years. However, do not forget to consider projected increases in health care costs and your potential eligibility to take advantage of the Small Business Health Options Program in 2014. Is it your first time offering employer-sponsored benefits options? Dont worry. You can discuss options with your benefits consultant or broker to get an expert opinion to help you weigh the costs. Remember that a broker or agent is a resource and will be there to answer questions for you in the implementation process and beyond. In 2013, health care costs are (PDF) to increase per employee by 5.3 percent (0.6 percent lower than in 2012). You can use cost estimates to determine approximately how much it will cost per employee, as well as potential starting in 2015 for not providing employee health coverage.You can also estimate your eligibility for small business tax credits to help defray the costs associated with health care coverage. Youve decided to make benefit options available to your employees. Now the question is, what approach will you take? Youve got options. Lets go through them: Work with your broker or benefits consultant to understand how your current benefit options work within new ACA (PDF). Remember that your employees may be eligible for tax subsidies through the . This could be the case if their required contribution to employer-sponsored health insurance exceeds 9.5 percent of their annual gross income or if the plan pays less than 60 percent of covered health expenses. Also known as an exchange, the health insurance marketplace is expected to offer small businesses and individuals competitive benefits options. Small businesses participating in the marketplace may also be eligible for a tax of up to 50 percent of their premium payments if they have 25 or fewer full-time employees whose average wages do not exceed $50,000 per year. This is when a company is responsible for covering the claims in a health care plan. Employers can save costs related to premium taxes and state insurance regulations because these plans are not included in some ACA requirements. These plans typically shift additional costs to employees, especially when an employers workforce has significant health care needs. Companies might want to consider adding stop-loss coverage to accommodate for annual and lifetime dollar limit restrictions. This model enables employers to give their employees a fixed amount of money and a list of health insurance options. It helps employers keep costs predictable while also enabling employees to create plans that meet their needs. Defined contribution models require employees to be well-informed about health care. While the above is intended to provide general information about an evolving topic, it does not constitute legal, tax or accounting advice regarding any specific situation. I strongly encourage you to discuss your HCR situation with your advisor to determine the actions you need to take, or to visit for additional information.","Yelp, FourSquare, Facebook, Twitter  theyre all great platforms and represent huge opportunities for you to market to your customer base.  But the big dog is officially on the scene and he wants to make sure youre aware of his presence. The big dog, of course, is Google. Its been hard not to notice the very calculated steps that Google has been taking over the past few months as its geared up its local and mobile properties, slowing trying to push everyone else out of its way. Well, unless you havent been watching. If not, heres what you missed. In April 2010, Google made its first big push toward local, . At the time, Google Places wasnt much more than a rebranding of Googles Local Business Center; however, it set Google up for a slew of new launches. To make sure business owners were aware of the new Places, Google held introductory webinars to show them how to use it, tell them what was changing, and explain why SMBs needed to be part of it.  It seems to have worked.  A few months ago, Google revealed that Google Places accounted for 50 million businesses. Not bad. In August 2010, Google took some big steps in getting into the world of online reviews. After unsuccessfully trying to acquire Yelp, Google decided if you cant buy em, beat em.  That month Google removed and opened up the opportunity for SMBs to .  I mean, who needs Yelp anyway? Certainly not Google. Taking things up a notch, in November, , a service designed to make local recommendations more personal by recommending places based on your ratings and the Hotpot ratings of your friends.   Unlike Yelp, reviewing locations on Hotpot required only a few clicks, seemingly helping Hotpot to target a more mainstream audience, not just the review-savvy folks who hang out on Yelp. Of course, it hasnt stopped there, and Google shows signs theyre only getting started. So far in 2011, Google has added (waves to FourSquare, Yelp, Facebook, etc.), integrated , given and . All indicators show that Google is serious about ruling the local search marketing the same way its taken over traditional search. Google is highlighting local more in the SERPs, creating services around generating reviews, and offering SMBs more visibility and marketing power. As a small business owner looking to market to your customers, youd be wise to stay up to date on whats Google doing and make sure that your business is widely represented on all of Googles different local platforms. It there a time investment associated with keeping up? Absolutely, but with Googles power in the marketplace, you cant afford not to keep up.  Claim your Google Place listing, encourage users to leave reviews on Hotpot and Google Places, manage the reviews that come in, and take advantage of all the free marketing opportunities being offered up.  Its only going to get more competitive out there.","Weve all heard about how important social media can be for our small businesses.

In fact, the latest from McKinsey finds that despite a steadily improving economy, Americans penny-pinching ways have gotten even worse in the past few years. McKinseys September 2012 consumer survey found that most Americans were optimistic about their futures and spending more freely. But since then, their outlook has either plateaued or gotten worse, the study says. Nearly four in 10 consumers surveyed are fearful of losing their jobs, and a similar amount say they live paycheck to paycheck  an increase from 31 percent in 2012. Not surprisingly, families making under $75,000 annually are making the most spending adjustments. Some 40 percent report cutting spending or delaying major purchases in order to get by. Just 22 percent of those with household incomes over $150,000 do the same. But no matter what income level they report, the vast majority of consumers arent feeling positive about the future. Only 23 percent are optimistic about the economy  even fewer than the 27 percent who felt optimistic in 2009. The cost-cutting behavior Americans adopted during the recession has continued to hang on. Some 40 percent of consumers report having cut spending in the past 12 months, and 55 percent say they will look for cost-cutting ideas in the next 12 months. In order to save money, customers are: Trading-down behavior is especially persistent. Almost three-fourths of consumers say they dont plan to go back to the more expensive brands they traded down from during the recession. A few bright spots in the economy are food/beverage and health/beauty. Although Americans cut back on dining out and takeout in recent years, the study finds theyve reached saturation with this behavior and are ready to start eating out again. In addition, food/beverage and health/beauty are the categories in which Americans are least likely to trade down to cheaper brands. Still, the reality is that nearly 40 percent of consumers say they will probably never return to their pre-recession approach to spending. Almost three in 10 say their attitudes about spending have changed (up from 17 percent in 2010, during the depths of the recession) and 24 percent say their economic situation wont allow them to spend as much as they used to. Even among those who want to spend the way they used to, most are waiting until they can pay down debt, save money or get back to their old income levels. How can you counteract this frugal outlook and get your customers buying again? Here are some tips. Baby Boomers are the group least likely to be cutting back or trading down on anything, so they can be a good consumer demographic to target if you arent already. If youre targeting middle-income shoppers, your marketing message needs to convey understanding of their budget concerns. Emphasize how your products or services help them reach their goals, such as saving money for more important things or getting lasting quality. To attract most shoppers attention, youll still need to offer discounts, coupons and deals. Do the work to figure out the discounts that will get shoppers in the door but still leave you with decent margins. Middle-income consumers are cutting back on higher-priced items. If you sell luxury products or services, youll have more success focusing your marketing on higher-income consumers rather than the aspirational set. Millennials pay more attention to prices, use more coupons and shop around more than the general population. However, theyre also more likely to splurge in areas such as food, beverages and personal care. If Millennials are your demographic, focus on products and services that matter to them, and emphasize qualitysuch as healthy, locally sourced ingredients in food.","The world of mobile marketing can be overwhelming for already-busy small business owners.

But the SBA nominee said not enough is done to simplify the process for small community banks that want to offer SBA backed loans. Contreras-Sweet said more must be done to help these banks understand the process so that they actually want to become an SBA backed lender. After that, Contreras-Sweet says more must be done to promote SBA backed loans and other products to small businesses.She said that this is because when community banks finally do decide to offer SBA backed loans, they often face a daunting task promoting them in their communities. Contreras-Sweet advocated the same approach when seeking to get more businesses involved bidding for government contracts. Last July, the in government contracts went to small businesses in 2012. Thats about $3 billion short of the federal governments goal.Contreras-Sweet said hitting that goal in the future would require more effort from the agency to explain the process of getting government contracts so that more small businesses would bid. However, she also said it would require what she called de-bundling larger government contracts often given to much larger corporations to be sure that small businesses get their share. The position of SBA Administrator has remained unfilled since the departure of former Administrator Karen Mills in February of 2013. President Barack Obama . Contreras-Sweet is considered to be a well-qualified candidate, given her background and experience, especially her experience starting and running a community bank.","Today at its #Inbound14 conference, HubSpot announced the launch of its sales platform. The platformconsists of Sidekick, which is a sales acceleration product, and the HubSpot CRM system. HubSpot is known for its marketing platform, and today serves 11,500 customers with it. The new sales platform extends the capabilities of the HubSpot system from the marketing department, traditionally responsible for generating and nurturing leads, over into the sales department, which is responsible for turning leads into sales. The announcement comes on the heels oflast months announcement that . The companydescribes Sidekick as arebrand and relaunch of HubSpots Signals tool, which debuted last year. The relaunched product addsnew features. Sidekick is a browser extension that assists withprospecting, connecting, and engaging with potential leads. Real-time notifications tell you when, where, and how prospects are engaging with you by opening or clicking your emails or visiting your website, the companys announcement reads. But according to CRM industry analyst Brent Leary, the news today most likely to be of interest to small businesses is about the HubSpotCRM system (see screenshot below). According to Leary, the HubSpot marketing platform todayalready supports lead generation. The HubSpot name has become synonymous with the term inbound marketing and it helps withgenerating the lead, nurturing the lead and scoring the lead. But when the lead has been enriched enough to be transformed into abuyer, itleaves the marketing department. It flips over to the sales force. Thats where a CRM system normally kicks in. If a business doesnt have a CRM system, they may not be able to capitalize on that lead. Before nowHubSpot hasnt had a CRM system of its own. Leary adds, HubSpot has integrations already with other CRM systems, such as SalesforceandSugarCRM. Larger customers of HubSpot typically are the ones that have already integrated with anotherCRM system. I am surethose larger customers will continue touse the CRM of their choice. Its the smaller customers of HubSpot that today tend to operate without any kind of CRM. HubSpot CMO Mike Volpe confirms that this system is designed forsmall businesses. One of the challenges for small businesses historically has been building sales and marketing systems that connect without massive integrations or technology needs. Our customers have been asking us for years to build a CRM that can be used on its own or with the HubSpot marketing platform. (See our backstoryinterview with VolpeaboutHubSpot CRM and the .) In Learys view, theres a large need for CRM in the small business market. There are many more companies using CRM today than are using it,especially smaller businesses. Just look athow many small businesses dont even have websites. Its around 50%. So its not surprising that the majority of small businesseshave no CRM system. Instead, they use substitutes for a full CRM system. They may use spreadsheets, their email system, or even their accounting softwareto do some basic contact management.But with those kinds of tools, a business doesnt getthe automation that can help them create a customized opportunity cycle to manage leads better,Leary adds. Im not surprised by this move. HubSpot is suited forbusinesses that have a complex sales cycle and get a lot of leads from inbound marketing. Today it has a footprint on the largerend of small businesses well intomiddle market businesses. Smaller businesses really need a seamless CRM experience with their marketing system, he observes. HubSpot CRM connects to Gmail, Google Apps, Outlook, and Apple Mail. It offers a view designed to help sales teams navigate and chart opportunities. Sidekick is available now at , butthe CRM is currently in a public beta. The CRM systemwill be rolled out more widely starting withexisting HubSpot customers by early 2015. It is free and can be used as a standalone system or combined with the HubSpot marketing system. It is available for the desktop and on HubSpots app for iOS and Android.","This guest column is by Cris Styris,Mobile Application Developer at Solution Analysts Programming language plays a big role in determining how frustrating or enjoyable the entire mobile app development process will be for you. There are some commonly preferred languages that all developers veer towards and then there are some languages that the native platform is built upon. As smartphone sales are ready to hit the 1.4 billion mark in 2016, the industry for mobile applications also expands. As new platforms are arising and programming languages are getting consolidated, more avenues open up for integrating dynamic features in apps and even coding becomes simplified. We bring you a choice of top 5 programming languages for mobile application development that is highly prevalent among developers worldwide. HTML 5 is best suited for web-fronted apps for mobile platforms. With this programming language, it is easy to insert different data types, rationalize input parameters, ensure uniform performance across different screen sizes and work seamlessly across browsers. HTML 5 based programming is cost-effective and though it is a relatively new programming language, it is popularly adopted by mobile app developers. It supports multimedia on mobile devices and has advanced syntactic features for video, audio and canvas tags. It has phenomenal features for user interaction with documents such as parsing rules for enhanced flexibility, drag and drop between documents, offline editing, messaging enhancements, and a common standard for storing data on SQL database. Java is the most widely-used object-oriented programming language in mobile app development mainly because it is the language used for Androids SDK and the wide-spread popularity amongst programmers. Java is a compiled language that can be run in a browser window or in a virtual machine without a browser. Thus, a lot of codes can be reused while updating the software. Java is the primary programming language for cross-platform app development frameworks. The JavaScript scripting language is popularly used for web browser app development and is extremely useful for adding web page features while working with HTML 5. Java is widely used for enterprise mobile app development as it offers unwavering performance and can be run with or without a browser. The only drawback with Java is that it cannot be used in iOS app development. Swift is the programming language being used to write Apples latest APIs  Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Though Swift is written to work along with Objective C, Apples eventual aim is to completely overhaul the former programming language by Swift. The programming language has been designed to plug many security vulnerabilities that occurred on Objective C. At the WWDC 2015, Apple announced that Swift will be going open source and it can be accessed by developers worldwide to build projects with Swift, making it the primary development language. At the WWDC 2016, Swift 3.0 was unveiled with a whole bunch of features including new design guidelines for building APIs. Also, with the new version, Swift can be ported to other platforms, primarily Windows and Linux and Apples Swift Evolution GitHub page has codes with portable attributes. There are rumours that Google may also adopt Swift in favour of its Java-based development platform. Apple adopted Objective C as the primary programming language for the iOS platform that serves iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch and MacOS framework. Just like C++, Objective C is a C language superset and does all the things done by C and C++. However, Objective C has additional functions for graphics, display and I/O. It is slowly being replaced by Swift in the Apple ecosystem. C# is an object-oriented programming language that is used widely by Microsoft and extensively on the Windows Mobile platform. As per a study by Developer Economics Survey, 38% mobile developers use C# for part of their work while 16% use C# as the main language. If Windows Mobile platform figures in your development portfolio then C# is an essential programming language for you. C# is also widely used for cross-platform mobile application development and can be used instead of Objective C, Java or Swift. Developers who are familiar with the curly brace syntax of C# will be familiar with Java, C and C++. C# supports generic methods and types and provides powerful features such as lambda expressions, enumerations, nullable values and direct memory access that are not found on Java. This enables the programmer to implement custom iteration behaviours that are simple to use on the client-side. As of June, 2016, a report by Statista states that Androids Play Store has 2.2 million apps and Apples App Store has 2 million available apps , and these are the leading mobile platforms worldwide. As the mobile app development fraternity increasingly adopts the open source format, and even Apple is finally opening its platforms to the worldwide developers community. Programming languages are also maturing and codes can now be reused to speed development process and reduce development costs. Disclaimer: This is a guest column.

A company decided on its computing environment - its designated operating system, devices and software - and thats what employees used. Period. But then along came the BYOD trend. BYOD, which stands for Bring Your Own (computing) Device to work, has swept America in the past five years. Employees got used to using technology in their personal lives  so much so that that they didnt want to give it up when at work. We all seem to want the flexibility to work from home and while on business travel, using devices we individually feel comfortable with. And of course we all want to use the coolest new mobile devices rather than staid company-issued laptops or desktop computers. If your business is like ours, youre now under pressure to allow employees to use their own smartphones, tablets and laptops for work. A study last year found that 95% of large companies surveyed allow employees to use employee-owned devices for work. Its now become ingrained in the workplace. The BYOD trend has benefits, to be sure. It makes for happier employees. They can be more productive while working outside the office. But the BYOD trend also poses extra challenges for businesses: One obvious thing is that it is harder to control your IT environment. With companies relying more on technology to conduct business, theres simply more to manage to make sure everything works as seamlessly as possible. Top that off with employees using a variety of devices and operating systems  and complexity multiples. Then you have the morphing of personal activities with work activities when people use a single device for both. The question becomes how to partition them. How do you keep personal email separate from work email in a way that employees dont resent, and that protects both the company and the employee? Your team may work from different locations, such as their homes, or they may simply do more work while out in the field or on business trips.They will be using mobile devices and that brings added challenges. Mobile security is one of them  and that can be as simple an issue as a tablet getting lost. One honeypot study found that when mobile devices where intentionally lost, in almost all cases the data was accessed, either for illicit purposes or simply to discover the owner. If a mobility-related incident resulted in losses, the average was almost $250,000. Small businesses in general face more IT security challenges than ever before. , companies with fewer than 250 employees were the focus of 31 percent of all cyber attacks last year. And with so many different devices, and so many of them being mobile devices, security concerns are multiplying. A lot, actually. The most important thing is: do not turn a blind eye to BYOD devices. Recognize that the IT environment is very different today. It calls for new policies, employee education, adoption of up-to-date best practices, and last but not least, implementing device management tools and other technology solutions designed for a BYOD environment. Here are 5 steps to take to operate in a BYOD environment: The whole idea behind the BYOD trend is giving greater freedom to employees. However, there are ways to achieve a sense of freedom, without abdicating control altogether. For one thing, make it a policy that all devices have to be registered with or brought to the attention of your IT administrator or any outside firm that assists you with IT, so that device management solutions can be enabled. Some employers exert more control by creating a list of approved BYOD devices. While this poses some restrictions on employees, at least it meets them halfway. You have to know who is using what. For instance, require mobile devices to be secured with a password-protected screen lock when not in use. Also, require employees to notify the company immediately in the event a mobile device is lost or stolen. These and other best practices will help protect your business. With freedom comes responsibility. Create a written BYOD policy for employees. This could be in the form of a memo, incorporated into the employee handbook, and/or placed on the company intranet. Make employees aware of what is acceptable, and whats not. Take the time to educate employees about the challenges and risks. Youll get more cooperation if they understand the why behind rules. A lunch and learn session or simply bringing up the topic in staff meetings can go a long way. This is probably one of the most crucial things you can do. A mobility management solution gives you a way to manage multiple devices and applications, from a central dashboard. It enables you to view the big IT picture and treat BYOD devices as integral points in your IT systems  not something separate or unrelated. Look for one that offers robust security and that protects important company data. Security certainly will be at the top of the list. But you also want the ability to monitor and manage mobile devices. Beyond that, some mobility management solutions can help you manage expenses, too, through consolidated reporting. You can manage different devices and different plans through a single dashboard. Advanced security specifically for mobile devices, such as capabilities for remote wipe of data in the event a mobile device is lost, and data encryption, can create peace of mind. Data archiving solutions can also add to convenience. They help you meet disaster recovery and legal archiving requirements, and further secure your IT assets. Bottom line: there is a lot you can do to allow employees the freedom and flexibility to use devices they prefer. You dont have to sacrifice protection of your business assets or create an unwieldy logistical situation in doing it.","If anythings beating out the skyrocketing growth of the mobile app market, Id put my money on cloud services. These days, you can do everything in the cloud except your dry cleaning (or can you?). Heres a look at some of the industries and companies that are moving into the cloud computing services arena for small businesses. Remember hard drivesthose clunky things that sat on your desk that you never remembered to use for backup? Well you can use yours as a doorstop now, thanks to cloud services that offer virtual storage. With these services, small businesses can back up data, share files online and designate a place for everyone to collaborate on project documents. Were also moving away from hard-wired phone lines, thanks to Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) computer cloud services. Whether you use a traditional style VoIP phone, your computer or a mobile phone, using the Internet to stream calls can save small businesses a bundle. The list goes on and on. You can balance your business books with . Send faxes without a machine with cloud-based fax solution. Teach and take online courses at . If its not imperative that you do the task in-person, theres probably a cloud version for it. Going cloud-based for your small business can realize savings (compare paying a few dollars a month to back up your data versus buying a physical server that needs updating), give more of your employees access to important documents, and help you communicate no matter where you are. While, yes, Im all Suzy Sunshine about cloud computing services, be aware that by using them, you lose control of who manages your data. If youre outsourcing, say, your backup to a third party, as CNN Technology notes, they may not take the extreme measures you would to encrypt data to prevent breaches. Could a jilted ex-employee of that cloud company take out his anger on your data? Could happen. Servers crash, even for larger companies like as CNet reports.","West African entrepreneur and inventor Kodjo Afate Gnikou didnt have access to a lot of tools and resources for building new technology. But he wouldnt let that stop him from creating cutting edge devices. Instead, he frequented local scrap yards and put together what is believed to be the first 3-D printer made from e-waste. In doing so the entrepreneur has not only found a way to create a much more expensive piece of technology at a lower price. Hes also found a way to reclaim technology waste in a way that may keep more of the material out of garbage dumps and landfills. This could be the start of a green tech business. The 33-year-old said in a recent interview with Euronews: To create his printer, Gnikou scoured a nearby scrap yard to pick up rails and belts from old scanners, as well as bits from old hard drives and desktop computers. He had to buy a few supplies new. But overall, the 3-D printer only cost him $100 to make. Gnikou has spent several months creating his prototype. The device is already able to create containers and other helpful household items. But Gnikou says he isnt done yet. The entrepreneur also believes a larger version of the printer could eventually be sent to Mars as an inexpensive way of creating homes for humans there. Others see the potential, too. Gnikou was recognized by the challenge last year. It might sound far-fetched, but building a 3-D printer from materials found in a West African scrap yard probably didnt seem that plausible before Gnikou made it happen. His ambition, creativity, and attention to detail allowed him to create an incredibly useful device while finding new uses for old and discarded materials. Too often, people let limitations like lack of funding or supplies get in the way. If more people, particularly entrepreneurs, used such roadblocks as a chance to get creative, wed likely have much more innovation in the world. 3-D printers can cost thousands of dollars to buy. Even the . So if a company needed such a device and didnt have the funds, it would be easy to simply give up. But Gnikou created a device for a considerably lower cost by thinking outside the box. And thats a quality all entrepreneurs should value.",", known for its email marketing system that serves over 100,000 customers (many of them small businesses), just announced that it has acquired the . Roost, based in San Francisco, allows you to update your social media accounts (currently Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook) from one dashboard. Theres a built-in calendar to schedule and publish updates in advance. While there are other tools out there that do similar functions, whats interesting about Roost is that you can schedule social media updates like marketing campaigns. In a campaign, you can schedule updates to go out over a specified period of time  up to 40 updates over a period of 30 days. So, for instance, if you wanted to promote a special offer with a series of informational tweets and also discounts, you could set that up in Roost. Roost also gives you some analytics about your social media impact. For instance you can measure engagement with your social media updates. You can also see where your Facebook fans are located geographically, as well as some other features. Roost a few months ago. Back in August of 2011, we did a . At that time, Roost reported that it had a customer base of 30,000 small businesses. TJ McCue, who conducted the review for , wrote what he liked about Roost, noting: The product still offers a free version, along with a premium plan that appears to target real estate businesses. As of this morning, you do not have to be a user of Vertical Response to get value from Roost. You can still use Roost as a stand alone tool. Theres no mystery why an email marketing system provider would purchase a social media tool. For too long now, email marketing and social media marketing have been separate. But when you think about it, a company is losing out on opportunities to better understand and serve its target audience when the two activities are siloed. According to Janine Popick, CEO of Vertical Response: Vertical Response, also headquartered in San Francisco, has been adding tools to its stable. It added an , and before that a .","Todays small business owners often earn income through a variety of ventures. For example, a restaurateur may open a wine shop or a caterer may also double as a part-time copy editor. If youre running multiple business projects, youve probably wondered whats the best way to structure all these ventures. Should you form one corporation to cover them all? Should you form an LLC for each one? You need to answer these questions from both a marketing and legal perspective. For marketing, you need to consider the markets and target customers for each venture. Are they synergistic? Are they relevant and will they appeal to the same customer? If so, it makes sense to market them under a shared brand. For example, it may make sense for a restaurant and side wine shop to share the same branding. In other cases, your businesses might target different customer types (for example, the copy editor and caterer). In this case, you want to use different websites, business names and branding for each venture. But how do you structure multiple business ventures from a legal perspective? There are three ways to . Each option has a different set of advantages and disadvantages  and the right approach depends on your unique needs. Heres what to consider: You can form an LLC or corporation for each business venture. For example, you can form an LLC for a bookkeeping business and then form another LLC for . While this seems straightforward enough, be aware that this approach will result in considerable paperwork. Youll need to file separate forms (i.e. annual reports, meeting minutes) to the state for each structure. And if youve formed corporations, youll need to file separate tax forms for each corporation. If youre looking to minimize your administrative requirements, consider another option. Theres one exception to this rule and thats for real estate investors. If youre investing in rental properties or other real estate, you may want to consider forming an LLC for each property in order to protect each investment on its own. Then if property A is sued,only the assets belonging to LLC A are affected. Your own personal assets are shielded, as well as the assets belonging to Property B, Property C, etc. This is the best way to contain liability in potentially risky ventures. Your second option is to create one main company as an LLC or corporation. Once that LLC or corporation has been established, it files multiple fictitious business names, also called , for each of the ventures within the same state/county. With this approach, each business can have the right name and branding for their specific market, while still enjoying the legal protection of the main holding company. When its time to file your taxes, you can take the income earned from each DBA and report them in a single tax filing under the main LLC or corporation. Of course, situations vary and you should always consult with an attorney or tax advisor for individual advice regarding your particular situation. In the third approach, a holding company will own individual Corporations/LLCs for your multiple businesses. This scenario often comes into play for companies that are looking to be acquired. It also applies for those cases where an established company is looking to start a new business (and the established or holding company will fund the new business). The particular tax and legal implications can become complex for this scenario. Consult with a tax advisor and/or attorney for the best way to structure your holding company and its subsidiaries. Consider this overview of how to structure multiple businesses as just a starting point. And if youre working hard to build your businesses, make sure youre also .","In the context of business, sunk costs are when youve spent money already and will not recover it. In other words, youvesunk money into something. The problem comes in when you keep spending  even when whatever youve invested money in, is no longer a good idea. Yet you keepthrowing good money after bad. This sunk costs situation happens much too often in business. We insist on getting value out of the money weve already spent. We become determined NOT to lose money. We cant  we wont  let go. However, by not letting go when something isnt working, we can end up losing a lot more. We keep pouring money, time and effort into something that has no chance of working or would lead to a poor result at best. The project or initiative keeps costing more and more. Instead of cutting our losses, we compound them by hanging on. We make our losses worse. It goes against our nature to let go. Its called the sunk cost fallacy. A perfect example of the sunk cost fallacy came to light just last month, in May of 2013.  finally a 100 million technology project. It had dragged on for 5 years. The problem: a stubborn desire on the part of the BBCs Chief Technology Officer to continue building a custom system when commercial systems already on the market would have done the job at a fraction of the cost. Add to that an overpaid, under-supervised enterprise consulting firm  and you have a sunk cost fallacy of epic proportions. Instead of calling it quits, the project dragged on. Instead ofadmitting the money previously spent was sunk costs that would never be recovered,they poured more money into it. Entrepreneurs and business owners can fall into the same trap. We get emotionally caught up in a project, an employee, an initiative. We want to make it work. We think that somehow well turn things around. After all, it would be wasteful not to try to get benefits out of money weve already spent, we think. Wekeep pouring money into it in a misguided attempt not to lose our initial investment. We continue long after logic and good sense suggest its time to pull the plug. Pride sometimes is involved, too. Who wants to admit that something was a mistake? Maybe if we keep working on it, we can salvage it, we think. David Ariely, a behavioral economics professor and author of , points out that humans often think they will behave in one way (perhaps the way logic and reason suggest). But in reality we behave differently (perhaps driven by emotion to keep throwing good money after bad). We tend to focus on the money we will if we were to walk away. Instead, if we were reasoning through the problem, we would be thinking about what we could by scrapping a wasteful situation  and finding a better solution. As entrepreneurs and small business owners, what can we do? In other words, you need to look to the future, not money spent in the past. Put out of your mind the idea of recovering on sunk costs. The money is gone. Cut your losses. Sweep up the mess  and move on to something more productive. Its also important to . We may not even realize that we are in danger of succumbing to the sunk cost fallacy. When were smack in the middle of it, its hard to see that we are putting more money at risk. from someone not emotionally involved in the past expenditures. This is where a good accountant or CFO is worth his or her weight in platinum. He or she will be more likely to evaluate the situation logically. A smart business owner knows when to seek advice  and take it.","Evernotes awesome tagline hits home with just about everyone who has ever tried to keep up with the Internet torrent. If youre looking for a productivity tool, this Evernote review is for you. Evernote is a combination Web capture, bookmark, Web clipper, photo-storage, note-taking tool. I always thought it was just a way to clip things from the Web and store them, but it is so much more than that. This is a must-have tool for any business owner or executive who runs a company from many different machines, locations and devices. There are loads of ways to use it. Let me walk through how Ive been using Evernote through this test as a way to illustrate how it might serve your business. I have a meeting coming up and suddenly remember something I want to share with the client, so I record a message on my phone and send it to my private Evernote email via text. I clip about a dozen Web pages and tag them for future reviews or, even better, save them to the appropriate notebook. I used an Android phone (see my courtesy of Skype Mobile) to snap a photo of a great storefront and then of a handwritten note I made to myself. Again, I use the tag feature as the photo uploads so I can find it later. The handwritten note is digitally translated automatically so I can search on the words that were in that note. I tweet about the service and copy my Evernote notebook from within the tweet itself. The basic free service allows up to 60MB of notes and other filetypes. The account settings tab lets you see remaining uploads for each month. For example, Ive added about 20 notes this month and can add 24,000 more. You read that correctly; text-based notes dont take up much space. I can add about 330 more Web clips, in which Ive simply grabbed the entire page. Premium level is $5/mo if you need a lot more space or want to run Evernote for your business, school or nonprofit. Overall, Evernote provides a way to toss all your ideas, to-dos, photos, and virtual sticky notes into a large bucket and then sort and find them using tags and a super-powerful search function (especially the handwriting recognition). Evernote has a great page on their site that showcases how other people are using the tool. Learn more about .","Work meetings aren't always fun.

Winston Churchill Earl Cobb, author of the new book mentions that Churchill quote as his personal favorite. Its fitting as he raises his courage in sharing his executive and managerial experiences that he feels all leaders should possess. This is my second review of a publication from Richer Press, a small trade publisher that features various motivational and self-development books.

Being agreeable  the customer is always right, right? I said sure. This was a decision I immediately regretted when I saw the images the client provided. They werent horrible, exactly, but they werent anywhere close to being good, much less good enough to be used for marketing purposes. So I called the client and said that if we wanted to go forward with the images, Id need to have a member of our team edit them so theyd look better. They agreed and my team put their Photoshop skills to work. Transforming those substandard images into pictures we could use took two hours. This infuriated the client. Theres no way a little thing like that should have taken so long they protested. Do you know what happened? Wed run right into the Blink Factor. Have you ever heard the phrase, Time flies when youre having fun? It turns out that time can move pretty quickly in a number of situations. You may have experienced this yourself when youve sat down to work on an administrative task connected to your business, such as ordering some inventory or looking over employee time sheets. A task that you thought would only take a few minutes winds up consuming over an hour  perhaps even an entire afternoon. How does this happen? Cognitive researchers, the folks who study how we take in and process information about the world we live in, have identified two distinct processes people use to estimate how long it will take us to complete a given task. When we estimate how long it will take us to perform a physical task, such as walking to the corner store for a cup of coffee, were using implicit time processing. When we estimate how long it will take us to perform a mental task, whether its tedious in nature, think data entry, or creative, think writing copy or programming a website  were using explicit time processing. While people tend to be fairly consistently accurate when using their implicit time processing skills, theres a pervasive universal tendency to underestimate when we use our explicit time processing skills. We think mental work takes less time than it actually does whether were doing the work ourselves or someone else is doing it. The Blink Factor is the disparity between how long a mental task takes to complete and how long we, or more importantly our customers, think it should take. Obviously, the Blink Factor can introduce an uncomfortable amount of tension into an otherwise good working relationship. There are two elements to beating the Blink Factor. Data is your friend. As a business owner, you should be tracking how you use your time. Being able to look at objective records that detail how long it takes to perform given tasks will enable you to provide more accurate time frame estimates to your clientele. Dont guess. Know. Using a simple online tool like or the time tracking features in project management software like can provide you with objective, reliable data that will make it easier for you to accurately project how long a task will take. Knowing how long a task will take is only half the battle when it comes to beating the Blink Factor. You need to let your customer know how long the job will take as well. Managing expectations is essential to customer satisfaction. Thats why we now put a detailed cost breakout into every , sharing how long each element of our process will take to complete and what that will cost. The time to discuss whether your team works fast enough should happen before the job begins  not while the project is in process. Having an accurate time frame discussed and agreed upon gives us a base line to come back and refer to in case the Blink Factor threatens to disrupt your project. Integrating time tracking into your daily routine will deliver significant rewards in terms of customer satisfaction. Thats how you beat the Blink Factor.","This is one of my favorite quotes from world renown motivational speaker Tom Hopkins, that has guided and motivated me over my career. Millions of Americans are currently , which makes the job environment very competitive. But now is also the most optimistic, opportune time to change or find work since 2010. So how do you become perceived as, and known for, being a premium item in a generic market? One of the most interesting statistics is 29% of surveyed hiring managers found something on a profile that drove them to offer the candidate a job. So, more proof that your social media platforms are branding opportunities that are being monitored and used to qualify people and do impact being noticed and hired. Here are a few things that can help you stand out when job hunting, that should be obvious and common sense to most job seekers but a reminder is always good. Your best approach and mindset going into your job search should be to go for and find the right job, right fit and right culture. Bring all your relevance and value to the process, employer and workplace. This ensures ultimate job satisfaction and longevity and that you will be a great hire for a company. Make sure you have a current, professional and appropriate headshot. Make sure your professional image conveys who you are and how you want to be perceived. No flip flops, crinkled and tight clothes, low necklines or bad grooming. Create a functional resume that tells your career story, accomplishments and achievements more personally instead of a long listvertical bullet points. Use your first person I voice on your . Take your social media footprint, technology savvy and social recruitment very seriously.Presenting both your hard and soft skills is very effective on social media and there are jobs that are posted only on social networks between connections that are not on job boards. If you are not engaging  you wont see them. Blend your online and in-person networking. Get out and meet people through chambers, meet ups, professional organizations and referrals. Nothing replaces face-to-face time with the right people to so that you are more memorable. Prepare a concise, articulate branding statement, when someone asks you, What do you do? Be specific and focus on one or two things you want people to remember about you. This can be a door opener. In todays competitive job environment you have to have every advantage you can in your arsenal to stand out and get noticed. So take the initiative and responsibility for your career development, direction and job search. Get prepared, be professional and stay laser focused on moving yourself and your career in the direction you want it to go.","Writing great content isnt easy. Anyone who has ever tried knows this. Thankfully, however, there are techniques designed to make writing a great blog post easier. One of those this is to create a process for how youll do it. As a writer in the search marketing space, much of my time is spent crafting content designed to educate and (sometimes) entertain my audience. As the VP of Strategy at Overit, Im also responsible for helping our team to write content to be published on various platforms. As such, Ive had to develop a clear and effective process to keep myself and my team on task with the content we have to write. In doing that its not only helped us to get content out in a timely manner, but to create content people actually want to read and share with their communities. Turns out, the more you enjoy sharing your words, the better those words tend to be. My process for content writing looks like this: Start by creating a list of everything youre passionate about or that you feel like you can write on authoritatively. As a freelancer or small business owner, your list will undoubtedly be a mix of not only your subject-matter excellence, but also topics related to business, productively tools, work/life balance, and how you manage your day. Also think about the questions that youre constantly answering. What are the common problems/concerns your customers come to you about? What information are you often seeking? If you can pinpoint areas related to your business where many face difficulties, you can create a great benefit to your reader by solving their problems. Start keeping a list of potential topics to write about. My team uses Google Docs to suggest blog topic ideas, both for themselves and for other departments. There are two great ways to work out an outline for your blog post. The first way is that traditional outline our teachers taught us in grade school. It involves breaking out the main points of our post and creating a list of everything you want to include, in the order you will address it. By creating a traditional outline, it helps you work out the flow of your post and organizes thoughts in a logical manner so youre better prepared when you start writing. The second way to outline your post is verbally. Grab a friend or a voice recorder and talk out your post and main points instead of trying to write them. Talk about your topic like youre explaining it to a friend or a customer. For many, talking through your post is a lot more effective than trying to write about it from a blank slate. Once you record yourself, you can take the transcript and use it to build an outline. With a workable outline for your post created, start filling in the blanks. Add supporting evidence, show research, cite sources, give examples, tell stories, and just write. Dont worry yet about how it sounds, just get the words out and work on building your story. Focus on the ideas you want to convey, not your ability to say them intelligently. Because writing and editing are very different skills, trying to do both at the same time will hinder your process and cause you to get stuck rewriting and editing the same three lines. In step 3, just focus on getting your ideas out and saying what it is you want to say. With a first draft down, read your post out loud to help you spot any writing awkwardness, typos, wrong words, sentence fragments, and anything else that may be hindering the flow of your post. If you have a difficult time being able to read it, thats a good indication a reader will have a hard time getting through it, as well. If youre not currently in the process of reading your writing out loud, Id encourage you to start. Youll spot a lot more typos and awkward writing that way. Writing effective blog titles is hard. You need to not only describe your post and set your reader up for what youre about to show them, but you need to engage them and be descriptive for the search engines as you do it. To become better at writing blog titles (and writing, in general) Id recommend following blogs like , which truly make crafting blog titles an art. Adding compelling images to your content will help tell your story and affect how users perceive it. If youre going to use stock photography, you may want to re-read our post on to help you focus in on the photos that will add the most to your content. Concentrate on images that will set the tone for your post and draw people in. Images of people or that use warm colors often work best. If you dont already have a preferred site for purchasing images, TJ McCues post on can help you get started. Now that youve done the work, make sure to share your post via all of your social media networks, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and wherever else you participate. While you dont want to overload or spam people, sharing your post multiple times can help account for different time zones or preferred reading times. Above is my process for writing blog posts that people want to read. What do you find works best for you? How have you handled the content writing process?","In India, college drop outs are not looked upon favorably. You can try telling the stories of super heroes like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates all you want, parents will go, Um hmm, Um hmm, now go study for your IIT exams. If you say you want to be an entrepreneur instead, you will get a whack, a spank, an outburst and any number of other unappetizing reactions. Senthil Nayagam, co-founder of , a premier Ruby on Rails application development company, is the epitome of the new 21stcentury Indian entrepreneur  a college drop out. In 1999, having started his first business, an Internet center, to mediocre success, Senthil taught himself an assortment of other skills such as troubleshooting, Linux and eventually Perl, php, python and mysql, to help supplement his income and support his family. Not disheartened by his first relatively failed business attempt, Senthil moved to Bangalore in 2004 to try his hand at a software career. It was then that he discovered the potential of Ruby and to explode onto the software scene. It was also here that Senthil met Dinesh Kumar, who shared Senthils passion for business. Two years later and with the help of his newfound friend and co-founder, Dinesh, RailsFactory was born. Think of RailsFactory as your extended team, or in the spirit of NBA playoff season, your 6thman on the court, designated to accelerate your current development by hiring additional developers to meet your companys tight deadlines. RailsFactory focuses on consulting and delivering cutting edge Ruby flavored solutions to its global customers. In the last seven years they have gained over 150 employees, completed over 200 projects and over the past five years they have maintained an enviable 100% year-over-year growth. And RailsFactory can deliver these solutions without putting a hole in your pocket, too. While big tech companies in the Silicon Valley are   most large US Ruby consulting firms (i.e. Groupon acqhiring Obtiva), which keeps rates high for their services, RailsFactory remains a volume player with the freedom to work with both small startups and enterprise businesses. RailsFactory does this by utilizing two different billing options; fixed price and the elastic staffing model, both designed to provide the most bang for your buck. The fixed price option is geared toward start ups and small companies that need additional short term help developing a specific product, whereas elastic staffing gives businesses the opportunity to hire their own team of Ruby developers to work side by side with their staff for as long as they are needed. Whether a company needs iPhone or Android apps, complete eCommerce solutions, or even long term partnership for IT projects, RailsFactory can deliver quality, cost-efficient services with minimal turnaround time. Their expertise in Ruby on Rails and adoption of strictly agile development principles makes RailsFactory one of the premier end-to-end RoR (Ruby on Rails) solutions development companies. Although RoR was practically unknown in 2006, now all major companies in India, such as TCS, Infy and HCL, as well as companies around the world like Amazon, Cisco, NASA, BBC have dedicated teams to work on their RoR. With the RoR demand dramatically increasing and the availability of RoR resources much slimmer than the resources for, say, Java, or .net, RailsFactory has an unparalleled advantage in the market. In fact, the Ruby programming language is now being used in more ways than ever before. Whereas Ruby is gaining in popularity with companies such as global code sharing fulcrum, github, which is built on it, a language like Java is now only more useful as the JVM than the language itself. Plus, there is Jruby, a Ruby implementation in Java, which allows for the combination of Javas good parts with the greatness of Ruby. Software synthesis at its finest. So how did RailsFactory, originating in the humble region of Chennai, India, grow to become a global player in RoR solutions? With determination, creative problem solving and the desire for solidarity amongst fellow Chennai based software techies. Chennai is a close knit region that has received major visibility and funding over the last two years, but back in 2006, when RailsFactory began, there were no role models or mentors to turn to for guidance. So Senthil took it upon himself to create his own network within Chennais software ecosystem so that he could ask crucial questions regarding RailsFactorys growth spurts. Transforming from a self proclaimed lone wolf to an inspiring leader in software services was no easy feat for Senthil, but with power comes great responsibility and he hasnt shied away from moving his company forward with authority. Senthils keen eye for identifying and capitalizing on growing industry trends has helped RailsFactory stay afloat during this age of ever evolving technological capabilities, one trend of which is particularly important; polyglot programming. Polyglot programming allows for developers to combine the most advantageous aspects of any programming language so that they can use the best tool for the technology being produced. For example, end users on a mobile phone or browser dont give a hoot what technologies are used in the server; they just want a fast, responsive service, am I right? And although RailsFactory prefers Ruby, what is best for the customer comes first. RailsFactory uses other languages and components built on these other languages all the time, ensuring customer satisfaction regardless of programming language prejudices. Gee, if only every company had our best interests in mind instead of forcibly trying to sell a label to us lowly consumers. But the reality is this; with more companies turning to polyglot programming, as well as the addition of yearly UI paradigm changes causing many startups to desire mobile play along with their web app rewrites, and on top of THAT start ups are exploring new ways to monetize using big data, a software service and consulting specialist like Senthil must keep pace in order to continue enjoying success and growth. And this is where Senthils inherent curiosity, passion for all things software and desire to transcend conventional industry limitations separates him from the pack. Senthil and Dinesh have made RailsFactory a prototype for what they call Centers of Excellence. They have started developing new business units in the form of independent COEs for various technologies and they operate under the umbrella firm, . As of now, Sedin Technologies has RailsFactory, and PHPFactory, each dedicated exclusively to help clients manage the global convergence of software, mobile applications, Web applications, and cloud services. So whats next for RailsFactory? Naturally, they want to be the worlds largest RoR development company in the world. With over 150 developers growing and counting, an office in Chennai and the Silicon Valley, RailsFactory is determined to set up operations in every global region that brings in more than ten percent revenue. That leaves Senthil contemplating a physical presence in Australia, the UK, as well as other additional locations in India for starters. Not too shabby for a guy who dropped out of college, flopped on his first start up venture and got fired from his job in Bangalore in 2004. Moral of the story: India needs to start thinking outside of the box and let its youth take more chances, fail more often and chart their own courses.","Its time again for our week in review.

The goal is to deliver a high quality, fresh product that customers will love. However getting that high quality beer to the customers home can be a challenge for a small brewer. After talking with many small breweries, Steve Young discovered the problem was in the packaging. Young was a stock market analyst by trade. But recently he had taken an interest in the craft beer industry. In search of more information on factors that could impact the craft beer market, he visited breweries across the US. Time and time again he found a common problem faced by these breweries. The problem was how to get beer to their customers and maintain its quality and freshness. Many of these small breweries used growlers to transport their signature craft beers. These heavy glass bottles can be conveniently filled, but once opened the beer only lasts about two days. Young saw an opportunity to create a packaging system to solve this problem. It didnt take long for him to quit his job and begin to assemble a team. What came out of this was , a draft system that boasts being able to serve any beer straight from the tap at home. At the heart of the system is a portable cartridgegood for one use only that can be filled from any holding tank, keg, or tap. The system is being compared to a in how it functions. This video gives a quick overview of how it all works: There is a hitch in SYNEKs system, however. The packaging might have the potential to be a game changer in the craft beer industry. The cartridges are easy to fill. And once opened, SYNEK claims the beer can last up to an impressive 30 days. The catch is that without the expensive SYNEK machine you cant access the beer in the cartridge. Thats a frustrating fact if all you want to do is enjoy your favorite draft beer. But this downside hasnt seemed to scare away pledgers. SYNEK launched a last year, raising over $600,000. The SYNEK system is now available for preorder and is scheduled to ship in early 2015. For now, the preorder price is $299, though there is no information on how much individual cartridges will cost.","The numbers show that companies will in 2010 as a way to market themselves and find new customers.  And that trend wont exclude small business owners.  SMB owners who have previously ignored the medium completely will find themselves entering the fold. And those with history in social media will be looking for new ways to increase value. With that in mind, below are some lessons that Ive picked up to help small- and medium-sized business owners navigate and get more from the social media waters. :  The Internet has always been about accountability. It gives business owners the ability to use tools to track everything from conversions to clicks to eyeballs and even patterns of behavior. And you can track social media ROI the very same way. However, dont jump in focused only on the numbers.  Give social media time to prove itself before you start obsessively refreshing your analytics. Even the most basic social media goals (build brand awareness, increase traffic, etc) will take a bit of time to develop. If you go in eyes staring at the numbers before you even developed a following or community youre going to be disappointed. However, the and the average social media campaign needs at least two months to show measurable results. : Its really easy to get lost in the quest to increase Twitter followers, and get everyone and their brother to become friends with your Facebook Fan page.  But what are those numbers getting you? If its not people who are engaged with your company and folks who want to interact with you, then youre chasing numbers that dont matter.  Instead, focus on the actions that will provide these things naturally, but also add value to your community.  Concentrate on creating great content, on helping others find resources located on different sites, on forming connections by reaching out to people, and by listening more than you speak.  If you take the proper steps now, the right kind of followers will come later. : You have a business to run. You cant spend your entire day in social media. I get that and so does your community. However, do make a point to schedule in time when you can interact so that customers can trust your presence on certain sites. Put yourself on a plan for engaging. For example, perhaps you know that in a week you want to write two blog posts, spend 45 minutes commenting on community blogs, three hours on Twitter reaching out, and an hour on Facebook responding to wall messages.  Schedule that into your week so that you know its going to get done.  Make Monday your blog writing day or Tuesday the day you do the bulk of your Twittering. Planning for social media is really important and makes it far more manageable. :  Were always talking about how big brands are using social media that we often forget how effective social media is for targeting the people in your own backyard. For example,  Advanced Twitter Search will allow you to find the conversations based on location. and allow you to find people in your area who share your interests. This is where social media becomes powerful  when it intersects with local.  Seek out these opportunities to find real customers who are talking about or show a need for what your business does. If youre a caterer and someones talking about their wedding, hop into that conversation (as a friend, not a business) and offer to help. If youre a local mechanic, find people talking about their bad brakes or the car troubles theyre having and chime in.  The opportunities to connect locally through social media are there if youre listening for them. Start. : 2009 was Twitter, Twitter, Twitter. And theres good reason for that  lots of people are on Twitter, but that doesnt mean your customers are. Reevaluate where your customers are hanging out this year. Are they on Twitter? Or are they hanging out elsewhere? For example, if youre a local wedding planner, you may find that you get a lot more value creating a Flickr group to promote photos of the weddings youve shot or the area you live in.  Chances are people looking for wedding vendors are searching for pictures and living resumes. Flickr gives you that in a way Twitter does not. Plus, by titling your photographs with the correct keywords, you give yourself a chance to show up in the SERPs when potential customers perform local queries. Thats value. : Whether its from Comcast, Joe from the deli across the street or a teacher like , seek out people who are doing social media well and watch what theyre doing.  See how theyre talking to people, what actions theyre taking, how often theyre engaging, how theyre able to take online connections into the real world, etc.  Weve seen enough social media success stories that we dont have to reinvent the wheel. You just have to see what works and find a way to make it work for your company, as well. : My was about taking the personal relationships Ive made online, off.  Your business should look to do the same in 2010.   Hold Tweetups to give your Twitter followers a way to meet one another in real life.  Create an in-store event through Facebook to let people see you in your element and .  Create focus groups of your online fans to help with new product reviews or usability testing.

But for those business owners that dont have the skills or desire to learn about photography, there are other options. offers one of those options. Customers can send their products to the company, and they provide photographs of each item. They can then use the images on websites, advertisements or other materials. Over the years, ProductPhotography founder Robert House and his small team have worked with some interesting clients and photographed a variety of different products. Read more about this companys story in this weeks Small Business Spotlight. Mail order product photography. Businesses that are interested in using the companys services can contact the company for a quote, then send their products out to be photographed. The company charges a per-photo rate based on the amount of products to be photographed and a few other factors. Then they quickly provide high-resolution photos of each product and either send the products back or discard them, depending on the clients preference. Providing a credible, legitimate experience customers can trust. When he first started the business, House said he was unsure if people would trust him enough to send out their products. But he made sure to provide friendly service and a quick turnaround to provide the best experience possible. Because of that, he said it didnt take long for the business to get some return clients. The company has been in business for about 12 years and has built a reputation that clients can trust. Since it was one of the first businesses of its kind, House said that gives them an advantage over newer businesses: On a whim. In 2003, House and his wife had just been married for a few months. He saw a gap in the market for this type of photography service so he quit his job and jumped in. Luckily, he said his wife was pretty gracious about this big change. He explained: Four. Securing the ProductPhotography.com domain. When the business first got started, it was called Robert House Photography. But House wanted a name and domain that reflected the companys specialty. So he contacted the owner of ProductPhotography.com and he agreed to sell it. House said: Spending big on a specialty domain extension. Earlier this year, some specialty domain extensions became available. One was .photography. House decided that having the Product.Photography domain could be beneficial, so they took the gamble and spent $13,000 to secure it. They still dont know if this gamble will pay off or if these specialty extensions will ever become popular. But he hopes that if they do, this early risk will help the business in the long run. Take chances. House explained: More space, photographers and gear. He said: A pomade jar from the Titanic.

Called , the advertising program made it easier for small businesses unfamiliar with pay-per-click advertising to get started. AdWords Express also cut down onthe time commitment withrunning AdWords campaigns. Small businesses had long expressed concernsthat AdWords had gotten too complex for non-marketers and required too much time  time that busy business owners couldnt afford to devote. AdWords Express was Googles way of addressing that concern. Fast forward to today. The program must be working, because Google has invested in improving AdWords Express. The company is also implementing changes to make AdWords Express more visibleto small businesses. that it is giving Express advertisers more control over defining and reaching theirexact target audience. In a post on the official Inside AdWords blog,Engineering DirectorXuefu Wang writes: He goes on to add: Wangalso says at the end of the article to look for more improvements in the coming months. This follows on the heels of making AdWords Express more accessibleon mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. And just last month Google made another move thatput AdWords Express front and center. Google launched My Business, a new dashboard that makes it more convenient to manage your business presence on Google properties. On that dashboard theres a prominent link to AdWords Express  making it clear that Google is committed to the Express program. We reached out to Robert Brady of , a specialist and expert in the field of AdWords and pay-per-click advertising for his impressions. He has a favorable impression of AdWords Express, for the right businesses. For businesses with a physical address, AdWords Express can be a good option. Its also best for advertisers with smaller budgets that dont demand high levels of control. Although todays announcement gives advertisers additional control options theyve not had before withtheir Express campaigns, theres still less control than the standardversion of AdWords. Less control is the trade-off you make for a program that doesnt require a lot oftime to set up ormanage. An example of a local small business using Google Adwords Express is Nicks Towing, mentioned in Googles announcement today. The owner manages campaigns on a smartphone on the go. And when is it time to graduate from Express to the regular AdWords program? According to Brady, its whenyouhave a largercampaign budget to work with,or your needs get more sophisticated. Brady says, When advertisers want to conduct more extensive ad copy testing or want to advertise in a larger geographic area they should consider regular AdWords. I would also recommend professional management for click budgets over $2,000 per month.

Not only does small business technology need to be maintained and upgraded when needed, it needs to be secure. Thats where the following franchise concepts come in.

Congress and the American public have debated whether or not this change could have a negative impact on consumers and businesses. The USPS has officially announced that beginning the week of August 5, 2013. Packages will continue to be delivered on Saturdays, and Post Offices that currently have Saturday hours will remain open, some with limited hours, to sell stamps and accept packages for shipping. Mail to PO boxes will also continue to be delivered on Saturdays. Since package delivery remains a more profitable part of the business than traditional mail, businesses like online retailers that ship products to consumers shouldnt really be affected by this change. But for other types of businesses, like those that use direct mail for marketing purposes, cutting Saturday delivery could potentially have more of an impact. However, since mail will still be delivered Monday through Friday, any potential negative impacts from the new schedule should be minimal. The USPS has been contemplating cutting Saturday delivery for some time, due mainly to loss of business from email and other forms of digital communication, as well as competition from private carriers like FedEx and UPS. The Postal Service expects that this measure will help to save about $2 billion annually, once the new schedule has been fully implemented. The USPS is a self-supporting government enterprise, and the only delivery service that reaches every address in the nation. In addition, the Postal Service receives no tax dollars or government funding for running its operations. Post Offices are funded by the sale of postage, and its other products and services.","In 2007, a group of young lads who called themselves The Indian Porn Empire gave India its most treasured matriarch: Savita Bhabhi. Savita Bhabhi tapped into a part of the Indian psyche that after long years of British puritanism had been subdued into a secret fantasy. For her maker, though, unveiling that insincere shroud of morality meant veiling his own identity from Indias righteous outrage. In the domestic roster of Indian archetypes, Savita Bhabhi embodied the favourite one: . Her success was expected, and the contemptuous response, too. Savita Bhabhi was borne of many passions and pitchers of alcohol. Deshmukh, her creator, has always been an entrepreneur at heart. A second generation NRI (non-resident Indian), he was intrigued by Indian culture and the potential of the Internet to experiment. Deshmukh says,We were a group of friend sitting together on a weekend having a few drinks and talking. As it is normally with a bunch of drunken young men, the topic shifted to women and sex. One of our non-Indian friends remarked that while Indian women were considered among the most sensuous in the world, we did not have a single really hot Indian porn star. Indias stock of porn stars have always been politely called erotic actresses. But their popularity ishardly pan-Indian; many becoming a caricature of the dramatic Indian erotic industry. South India is particularly famous for its brand of mind-boggling cost-effective porn. Those actresses well-known amongst porn enthusiasts tend to be based in the UK, Canada or the USA. For Deshmukh, though, Savita Bhabhi would be the quintessential porn superstar: a bored housewife with a neglected concupiscence. Rendering her on paper than screen allowed him to push sexual boundaries (legally speaking), besides being the only financially feasible solution. Young old Indians wanted to see more than a woman denuded one pleat at a time. They wanted a woman whod put aside the ritual of first having her jewellery taken off and skip right to the underskirt for a different kind of . Savita Bhabhi delivered. Savita Bhabhis [SB] first sexcapade took six full months to execute with Deshmukh at the creative forefront of her conception. With no real resources, the best course was to develop a toon porn star. One of my friends is an amateur artist, says Deshmukh. He came up with the first draft of SB. Initially there was a toss-up between SB being a young Gujarati woman or a South Indian aunty. We went ahead and posted some threads on a forum asking people which they prefer. The young Gujarati housewife Savita was born, a woman as versatile as a dish of . The next challenge for Deshmukh was to develop stories. She was the closest wed come in 21st century art and literature to the murals of , and nothing was more important than having a sexual icon people could relate to. Literally little was left to the imagination, because SBs stories were stories of real men and women, fans and authors. We got tonnes of email from fans detailing their fantasies and asking us if their fantasies can be converted into an SB toon. We try to keep all our plots fairly believable and connected to everyday occurrences, which could just lead into a sexual adventure. In her first ever tryst with promiscuity, Savita has an encounter with a bra salesman, a polemic moment in Indias post-modern literary anthology. Mistakenly, he sees her changing out of her clothes. Bored by the monotony of everyday domesticity, she decides to put on a show for the scoundrel. The rest is last night'shistory. In 2009, the Government of India slapped Savita Bhabhi with a chastity belt, padlocking her for good measure. The public seemed gratified whenever it wasn't secretly disappointed. The IT Act, 2000, little to do with fair and free access to information or technology, was used to silence Indias favourite bhabhi. Though, consumption of pornography is legal (an absolute ban would not only be economically infeasible, but would double the intensity of teenage angst), its sale, distribution and production is illegal. Only because the company is incorporated and run in the EU region with its sites hosted from the UK, its a legal operation. Deshmukh argues, In my opinion, the adult entertainment industry is no different from any online entertainment web-venture. My love for technology, a creative bend and most importantly a market need got me started in the industry. Being on the Internet, it is accessible to only those who want to. As adults, I feel we should be able to make that choice ourselves. That was the most confounding part of the backlash against Savita Bhabhi. Unlike advertisements, a far vulgar and unavoidable malady, SB was available online. It required users to get a computer, connect to the Internet, type in the website and then access its content. Nestled in the eighth wonder of this world, SB did not infringe on anyones space until they actively went in search for it. Its a testament to how much Indian culture leaves the social to dictate the personal. But Savita Bhabhi would persist. Full-time in the business of pornography, Deshmukhs identity in this chaos was not necessarily secret either. He preferred his low profile, but says, I was not trying very hard to keep it a secret either. Over the years, hed already begun sharing his hobby with more people. Now almost everyone close to me knows that I created Savita Bhabhi. Savita Bhabhi was neither something that shot to fame over-night, nor was it an obscure publication before it graced mainstream news headlines. Ever since the first episode was released, says Deshmukh, the amount of users on the site kept growing steadily -but fast- till we had about half a million users a day. Then, one day suddenly the Indian Government decided to ban the site. However rather than seeing that as a fatal blow, we saw it as an opportunity.""Savita Bhabhireturned with a slew of other titles on , an even bigger illustratedpornography platform. ""Itwas the best thing to happen to Savita Bhabhi."" But why was Savita Bhabhis presence so all-consuming? Deshmukh thinks it's because she is every man and woman in India, sweltering under the burden of latent sexualities. SB was and still is a very unique niche in the Indian entertainment scene. Its entertainment for adults who want to embrace their sexuality, but still not just regular porn. SB is about women exploring their sexuality and being sexually liberated. What we are trying to show via SB is that sex isnt only something a man wants from a woman. Its a two way street  women need pleasure as much as men. . Perhaps, this is true. In most Indian cultures, the woman always fills the role of a coy bride or must mimic the affectations of one. Savita Bhabhi was an unassuming liberated woman telling both men and women: desire is for sex, not gender. Deshmukh hopes to make this disruptive sexual force equally lucrative, too. He wants to see Savita Bhabhi mature into an established brand backed by the merchandising industry. Once shes part of the mainstream pop-culture, the possibilities are limitless, from fashion, jewellery, accessories to sex toys, collectibles and feature-length movies. ""I see Savita Bhabhi soon moving from the realm of being an Internet-only porn star to becoming a much more mainstream brand with offline products."" However, its never enough forthe South Asian to control the bodies of women, they must even strike judgement on womens representation in art and literature. Will the current polity temper its irritation with the routine disgrace of our fictional by a disreputable man? Deshmukh says, Honestly, I havent got a clue! The Government of India works in ways.","The creators of know that the team collaboration platform market is filling up fast. But they say that Glip is designed to make small business owners operate more effectively. The company says Glip was modeled with the small business person first in mind. Glip COO Claudio Pinkus told Small Business Trends recently that his companys platform is designed to replace the array of collaboration tools small businesses currently use. Pinkus says that the average small business owner is currently using six different apps to collaborate with their team, co-workers or customers. Instead of that clutter, Glip is supposed to be one place to have online conversations with anyone from anywhere. Glip is supported on desktop, smartphones, and tablets. Pinkus said: If youve got a meeting with one of your teams, you can and meet everyone there. A conversation stream runs through the middle of the screen. Glip says its platform is more effective at communicating with members of your team than constantly exchanging emails. Files and screen views can be shared with those in your conversation. This can be done rather simply, as Pinkus demonstrated in a product briefing recently. Video conferences can support up to 100 collaborators. Thats right  100. But as Pinkus reminded us: In the platform, you can schedule future meetings, assign tasks to team members and even create new projects. All these assignments can be saved within Glip and your team members can refer back to it at a later time. Video conversations you have on Glip can be recorded and saved, too. The platform works in just about any Web browser  the exception being older versions of Internet Explorer. You can integrate apps like Google Calendar and your email inbox. The first 10,000 messages shared in Glip conversations youre hosting are free. After that, you can access the system for as little as $5 per member of your team. You can always add guest users to your Glip conversations. Its free and doesnt require those guests to download any software. The $5 per month price tier gives you 5 GB of cloud storage for documents that you share during Glip conversations. For 10 GB of storage, the price jumps to $10 per month.","It is not always that writing gives you the shivers, and the thought of people you dont know brings tears to your eyes. Harsha Suryanarayana was one such legend and the best competitive coder to come out of India. Going by his username Humblefool, Harsha was a and was the since 2007 on the most coveted competitive coding platform in the world. On the unfortunate day of June 15 this year, Harsha was while crossing the road. Fondly known as Lord Harsha by his college mates, Harsha was not only a fellow programmer but a mentor to a lot of people. Alumnus of IIIT Allahabad, he was a prodigy. In his high school, he scored 100/100 in his ICSE exams in not one but three subjects. One of his teachers told Animesh Nayan, Harshas junior and Co-founder from MyCodeSchool. Founder of three startups and having worked for others too, Harsha lived more in his 32 years of existence than most people do in their complete lifetime. When IIT used to dominate every major programming contest in the country, Harsha bought IIIT Allahabad in the spotlight. He did not join any company after graduating, but came back to train his juniors for ACM ICPC contest every year. But it was not only his programming talents which made him a living legend, it was also his sense of judgment and ethics. According to Animesh, even in the exams, he used to finish the paper in half the time and leave the exam hall, but if he didnt know the answers, he would hand over a blank paper and leave. When Gangs of Wasseypur was released, he waited for the DVD to come out. , a close friend of Harsha on Facebook. This is what the tweeps had to say about him. Animesh was a very close friend and is the Co-founder of , A YouTube Channel to teach programming which Harsha eventually joined. Animesh recounts his journey with Harsha. MyCodeSchool became a part of the 10th Batch of Morpheus Accelerator Program. Harsha was a fan of underdogs winning a game; his passion for teaching surpassed the desire for money, he could have got a job in any company in the world but he chose to let that go and light up lives with his knowledge. He used to believe in non monetary mode of transaction; instead of money we enable people to inspire others and that should be a value addition. He used to live in the present and often talked about worst case acceptance. Running out of money was never a difficult question for him, To honor the memory of Harsha, Topcoder","If your business is looking for a powerful tablet but unable to budget for a high end price, theres more good news from Microsoft. The Redmond, Washington-based software giant has decided to cut the price on its Surface Pro tablet by $100 after a announced last month. The began this month and will likely be permanent, reports TheVerge.com The reason for the latest price reduction is simple. Microsoft says the recent cut in the price of its Surface RT tablet computers has already boosted sales. Remember, the price of the Surface RT was drastically cut by about 30 percent and costs just $349 in most markets today. The Surface Pro has already been reduced in most major markets around the world. For example, the . The company reportedly took a $900 million loss on the Surface RT in the recent quarter. Frankly, the price cut on the Surface Pro is bigger news potentially for small businesses than the earlier cut in price on the Surface RT. So whats the difference? Ultimately the distinction comes down to the operating system. The Surface RT runs an RT version of Microsofts Windows 8 different in several ways from the regular Windows 8 system. Most importantly though, the RT version wont run software that works on earlier Windows versions, big trouble for some small businesses that need devices compatible with software they are using on desktop computers. By comparison, the Surface Pro runs the full version of Windows 8, making it more compatible with the older Windows software many small businesses may still rely on. Its an important distinction, because one of the key attractions of a Windows tablet is the ability to run Windows office and productivity products on it with ease, just as if you are working on your desktop computer.","I know that video is HOT, HOT, HOT but I dont do it. I have my reasons. The fact that I dont like how I look and sound on video is just one. But an even BIGGER reason is that I simply dont know how to shoot and edit video. I even got myself a Mac because I thought it would be easier and I could create higher quality videos and edit them myself  but that hasnt worked out so well. At least not yet. But this past week, I received a review copy of by Michael Rosenblum ( ) and I have to say that Im feeling encouraged. This is a small book that will easily fit into your carrying case or purse and its fun and entertaining enough to read so that youll get through it fairly quickly and may not have to carry it around so much. But Id say youll want to keep it close at hand and review some of the concepts as you go about the process of learning what makes great video and how you can create killer videos all by yourself. As the DIYMarketer  this is something that is extremely appealing to me. Oh, and I dont want to forget the other appealing promise that I found on the cover of the book,   So what hes promising me is that within six weeks Im going to be a video shooting and editing fool  sign me up! In some ways, Michael Rosenblum is like a lot of us that grew up in the television generation. You know who you are. Youre the ones that spent hours and hours in front of the TV watching everything under the sun. I know I did. In fact, I can remember my mom and dad leaving me alone for a couple of hours and saying, Dont turn on the TV! and my sitting up close to one of those cabinet TVs with the door open and my hand right on the power button; ready to shut it off at the sound of them coming up the walk to open the door. But what sets Roesenblum apart from the rest of us TV addicts, is that he turned his TV watching experience into a career. Hes the founder of the New York Video School and has been a professional television producer. Michael has a real commitment to teaching people how to make video and TV on their own. In fact, hes trained over 30,000 people to date. So theres hope for all of us video-phobes yet. Rosenblum is clear about the fact that many of us have a block around creating our own videos. Weve deluded ourselves into thinking that were not good enough and dont have the equipment or skills to pull it off. He spends a couple of chapters convincing and showing you that even the basic smartphone camera is more advanced than the million-dollar set ups they used to create and produce many of our favorite shows. Besides  todays consumer is more interested in authenticity and clarity of message than how polished, artistic and professional your video looks. (Whew  Im relieved!) I had one of those whack on the side of the head moments when I read some of these tips: Take the time to scope out the scene. Rosenblum tells the story of master videographer, Mario Biasetti, who took more time to scope out the scene and plan the shots than he did actually shooting. He would look and scope and plan and finally, after what seems like hours he would shoot  for less than a minute. The end result was a series of so many perfect shots that Rosenblum had a tough time choosing which ones to use. Over and over again, Rosenblum makes the point that you only have a minute to tell your story and communicate. That means that you will have to cut and edit over 90% of what youve filmed. So this first step is getting a lay of the land and identifying just those elements that will forward your cause. Dont move the camera! This tip simply blew me away. I learned that its the movement of what the camera captures that should be the star of your video  not the camera movement. A great video starts with only five shots. This was another transformational moment for me. You always only need five shots. Learn these five shots and Rosenblum says youll create better videos than the pros: After reading this book, Im not sure if video will become my favorite medium but I can say that, in just a short read-through of this book, Ive already become a far better and smarter producer and consumer of video content. If you create videos for blogs or web sites, your readers will appreciate, watch and share your content. Even if the only video you shoot is on family vacation or your kids performances, youll want to read and work through this book. Believe me your audiences will thank you. Anita Campbell, Founder of Small Business Trends and host of , recently interviewed Michael on the radio show. You can listen to that interview in  . I didnt write too much about the possibility of selling your video, that is covered in the book. But I think that small business owners are more interested in creating video that sells products and services. If that sounds like you  then should be your next business book read.","The Web is buzzing with what may be one of the first instances of a business asking a customer to leave over its Google Glass policy.Not too surprisingly, this happened at Seattles Lost Lake Cafe and Lounge. The all-night Seattle restaurant its decision in a recent Facebook post: Of course, there are plenty of comments both supporting and opposing the policy and the decision. The reason all of this isnt too surprising is that Lost Lake Cafe and Lounge owner David Meinert has already made headlines and waves on this topic. That was for , The 5 Point Cafe. Of course, weve already seen one .But for business owners, the decision is a bit more tricky. The customer, Nick Starr, quickly posted on Facebook complaining about the incident, The Seattle Times. But Starrs is apparently not available at this time, perhaps because of the war of words going on. On the other hand, business owners need to consider the privacy and preferences of the majority of their paying customers. Some of them may not appreciate becoming part of someone elses online content.","When people think of free products, they are more likely to think of Google rather than Microsoft. But Redmond seems to be seriously considering up-ending the apple cart. Microsoft could be experimenting with a free slimmed down version of Windows 8.1, the Verge . A free Windows 8.1 version would have two advantages. One, it would upgrade people who are still on Windows 7, who are procrastinating about the cost of upgrading. Two, it would motivate more people to take the leap and become more integrated into Microsofts services. Perhaps this would tempt away some of those currently using Googles free apps. If a free version does become available, it wont include the full feature of the paid version of Windows 8.1. Instead it will be a version with more restricted apps and services bundled in. These could include Bing, Office, Skype and OneDrive. Some business owners may still opt to use the full version of Windows. However, small businesses who are on a tight budget may welcome a stripped down version of the software. For Microsoft there is only one problem. If they start giving away the product for free, why would anyone bother to pay for a Microsoft operating system in the future? That is the dilemma Microsoft leadership seems to be grappling with right now. How can the company strike the right balance between free software and it at the same time? If Microsoft sees a serious amount of revenue walking out the door, will they do what Google eventually did with Google Apps, and stop the freebies? Will it be a case of one hand giveth and the other hand taketh away? On the other hand, Microsoft is looking at their biggest rival, Apple, their last OSX operating system, Mavericks, for free. The consumer climate is shifting, and Microsoft has been slow to respond. Another option Microsoft is considering is cutting the Windows license fee to computer makers to either very little or free, if the limited version is installed. This has led one website to dub such computers   (as opposed to Chromebooks). Microsoft is even thinking about giving the Windows Phone OS to phone manufacturers free of charge. Windows Phone is currently lagging behind iOS and Android. Of course, Microsoft is already experimenting with giving things away. The company is currently offering 100GB of OneDrive space for one year in exchange for 100 Rewards credits in its Bing Rewards program. Credits are earned every time you log into Bing with your Windows Live account and make a search. The question is whether these offers will be enough to attract more small business users to Microsoft.","A new video chat platform allows you to create one on one video chats, video conferences or large scale webinars for free  and potentially profit from them too. , now in its beta launch, isnt just some Skype, Google Hangout or GoToMeeting knockoff.

Its not like Skype or iChat where you actually have to install software on your machine. It works right in a web browser. Unlike Google Hangouts, Spreecast is platform agnostic. This means you dont need to be signed into a social network to participate or create a Spreecast and you arent limited to inviting only those with a Google or other social account to participate. (Though you can sign in using your Facebook or Twitter account, if you like.) Spreecast also offers an unprecedented set of tools to control the conversation and at the same time more interaction for the audience than is possible with the audience watching a Google Hangout through a viewer window, Fluhr added. Spreecast also differs from other similar services. Unlike Skype, which essentially offers a video phone call service between two or more participants, Spreecast opens the potential for a large scale public forum conversation. Unlike GoToMeeting and other paid video conferencing services, Spreecast offers a free platform to hold private business meetings. Creators of a Spreecast can decide how they wish to use the site by choosing between several simple privacy settings to decide who has access. Up to four people can participate on camera at once, but many more can watch and participate via social chat tools. Tens of thousands of people can join a live Spreecast in sort of the audience if you will, Fluhr explained. And any one of the people in the audience can actually request to join on camera as well. To manage all this, the site gives webinar or video conference creators, or producers as they are called, the online controls to assign who will participate on screen. Producers can also preview and vet members of the audience who wish to be placed on camera. But thats not all. Producers and those they designate as co-producers can also share external media such as comments or questions entered by members of the audience, photos from Flickr, Instagram or Facebook, videos from YouTube or Vimeo and even slide decks from SlideShare. Its a fairly robust set of producer controls that you get when youre a producer or a moderator of a Spreecast, Fluhr said. Producers or members of the audience can use the chat section to the right of the screen to pose questions to other participants or make comments about the on-camera conversation. A screen queue section beneath the screen allows producers, participants or audience members to post comments or external media they would like shared onscreen. Spreecast producers and co-producers decide what to share. If you would like to charge for access to your Spreecast, in the case of a webinar for example, a pay per view feature collects money on behalf of the producer. Those fees are split 30/70 with the majority share going to you and rest going to Spreecast. (Again, its important to remember here that it is free to create a webinar or video conference on the site.) Spreecast has, however, begun charging for a few extra services, like custom analytics reports showing you the number of people who viewed your webinar or conference, how many shared it with others socially and how many asked questions. There is also a charge to download the video file from your Spreecast to your hard drive for upload to YouTube or another site. However, all Spreecasts are archived and can be embedded in your site or shared via social media for free. One of the most important ways small businesses are using Spreecast is to create interaction between customers and brands, said Fluhr. Specifically, he shared three businesses: , an organization for startup entrepreneurs; , an online auction house; and , creators of a teeth straightening solution. All three businesses use the site to interact with their customers and community. Spreecast allows another format for these small and medium sized businesses to engage with their audience or engage with their customers, Fluhr said. In this way, Fluhr positions Spreecast as a tool similar to social sites like Facebook and Twitter, a completely free platform where small businesses can build their brands.

One thing hasnt changed, however. As of 2014, Americans, including solopreneurs and employees of small businesses, are required to carry health insurance as individuals. If you dont, you may face a penalty come tax time. However, subsidies may be available to make coverage affordable. As for businesses that have employees, depending on the size of the business you may be required to provide health plans for employees. Also depending on size, you may be able to tap into SHOP marketplaces and get access to tax credits or deductions. The following is an update on the current status and where things stand today in 2014, depending on the size of your business. As a self-employed small business owneror solopreneur employing no one but yourself, you might think your business is not subject to the Affordable Care Act. But it isin the sense thatyou fall under the individualmandate. You are required to carry healthcoverage for yourselfbeginning this year. The penalty for not having coverage is the higher of $95 per person ($285 per family) or 1% of your yearly household income. But, by 2016, it will have escalated to $695 per adult and $2,085 per family. The penalty is paid on your annual tax return. . There are over 20 million self-employed small business ownersin the Unites States. As a self-employed business owner, you areable to deduct the cost of your own insurance premiums. . Even though the enrollment period for 2014 is closed, theres always next year to begin planning for. Calendar a reminder for later this year to talk with your insurance agent and/or check the healthcare websites (Federal or state exchanges) to begin shopping around for 2015. Just give yourself enough time to get a renewal decision from your existing insurer and/orlook at other quotes. If your small business employs fewer than 50full-time workers, you are required under the ACA to provide healthcare insurance benefits for them. But for various reasons, including a desire to help your workers, you may choose to do so. Also, there are some tax advantages available in certain cases. For those employing fewer than 25 full-time employees, atax credit isavailable. The credit is available to companies paying an average wage of less than $50,000 a year that decide to offer employee benefits. Also, for those businesses, the IRS says the maximum tax credit is 50 percent of premiums paid. But to be eligible for the tax credit, you must pay premiums on behalf of employees who are enrolled in a plan offered through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace. And the credit is available for two consecutive taxable years only. For those with 25 to 50 full-time employees, SHOP coverage is available; however, the tax credit is available only for businesses with fewer than 25 employees. And of course, you can always choose to provide your own plan and not use the SHOP Marketplaces. Look into SHOP marketplaces (by state you are located in) if you havent already done so. The SHOP section of the federal website is not yet fully functional,but help is available via phone and you can go through your own insurance professional. You can enroll in SHOP coverage any time. . Also, make sure you understand how to calculate a full-time employee as there are very specific rules around the definition. For purposes of the law, full-time employees are defined as those working at least 30 hours a week or 130 hours a month. The calculation must include not only time paid for work but also vacations, sick days other paid off time, ADP. Since your obligations and rights to the tax credit depend on exact numbers of full-time employees, you need to make sure you are keeping good records and making the proper calculations in order to comply. If your business employs between 50 and 99 full-time employees, the ACA currently requires you to begin providing healthcare coverage for your workers beginning January 2016. Thats a later date than the deadline for larger businesses to comply. Carefully evaluate all reduction in force or termination decisions, if any, you implement between now and 2016. To qualify for the January 2016 date, you must certify under penalty of perjury that your company didnt reduce workforce to fewer than 100 employees just to delay complying with the mandate . SHOP coverage (mentioned above) will be available for employers with 100 or fewer full-time employees no later than Jan. 1, 2016, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website. If your company currently has 100 or more full-time employees in place, the employer mandate for providing those workers with healthcare benefits goes into effect January 2015. As in the case of companies with between 50 and 99 employees, your company will face penalties if you fail to provide healthcare coverage or provide coverage that is not affordable to your employees as defined by the law. Your company would then be required to pay an Employer Shared Responsibility Payment equal to the number of employees multiplied by $2,000. Educate your employees. The majority of employees expect help from their employer on healthcare decisions. Andits never too soon to start planning! Interestingly, theres lot of chatter right now wondering aloud whether the employer mandate should be eliminated altogether. A recent analysis by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation eliminating the employer mandate would have no substantial effect on the number of insured or the cost of healthcare to taxpayers. But aword of caution for business owners: Talk of eliminating the employer mandate is just that and nothing has been decided on that point. As of this writing, the deadlines set forth in the healthcare law as listed above remain in effect. However, keep tabs because there may be other changes. Finally, remember that this is a complicated area with many legal and operational wrinkles. Talk with your insurance and tax professionals for information specific your businesss situation.","Local reviews and citations are critical to helping your SMB site rank in the search engines local algorithms. Weve heard this countless times. But is it just raw numbers that matter or does the quality of the review site domain play a part? Is there more that goes into it? These were the questions that Tom Critchlow of the London Internet marketing firm Distilled sought to answer with his newly released . And in the spirit of giving and free information, Tom has made all of his research available for download via both XLS file and Google Document.  Happy early holidays. To conduct his research, Tom used the phrase [hotels in seattle] to see which factors Google was using in order to return results for relevant hotels.  Tom mined the results, made note of the number of citations, reviews, the sum of both, rating, distance and then recorded them to see how the raw numbers compared to actual hotel rankings.  He also broke down the individual citations for each hotel, to show which sites and citations were most important for rankings.  I dont think Im spoiling anything by telling you that Tom discovered that its not just the raw number of reviews and citations that determine ranking. The engines are far more sophisticated than that. Youll have to read Toms analysis to get the full dirt. One thing I found really interesting was the idea that Google may be using the star rating system as a way to determine the overall sentiment of reviews (good, bad, neutral). Previously theres been lots of talk that the engines just wanted to see many reviews from lots of different places, but this shows that perhaps theyre really digging a lot deeper than that. If youre a small business owner, I recommend two things: While people and blogs can sit and talk about what we think the engines are and are not looking when determining rankings, theres no substitute for collecting your own data, seeing what works for your specific industry, and then acting on it. Thanks to Tom and the folks at Distilled for putting this one together. Very, very useful information.","The easiest way for a small business to lose money is through sloppy .

Share Cancel Market Definition APAC consumers are among the most receptive globally when it comes to participating in shared economy models. Just 22 percent of consumers in APAC are unwilling to share personal assets and services, compared to 32 percent globally. South-east Asia with around 618 million population offers enormous potential for any Peer-to-Peer business model, and even leads the segment, as four of the top five markets prepared to share assets and services at Peer-to-Peer level comes from this region. Indonesia stands second globally when it comes to renting product & services from a shared community, while the Philippines ranks fourth globally. Competitor Analysis There are few players in the segment in South-east Asia, like ServisHero, which is operating in Malaysia, Singapore & Thailand. They, however, connect all kinds of freelance job seekers and do not concentrate on college students or a particular segment of job seekers. Agent Anything and GeeksnGigs is one the few startups that are working in the area of connecting students with the part-time jobs. Pain Point & Target Audience The office goers and other busy individuals who find difficulty in finding reliable service providers for their household and odd errands will fulfill the demand side of the business. College & University students will fill the supply of individual service providers, and we all know that students, love doing a part-time job to make extra income for supporting their expenses. This platform will match them to these opportunities. Value Proposition This platform creates value for both the demand and supply side. For students, there will be an opportunity to work part-time along with his/her studies and make extra money to support their expenses. Students also have the liberty to work on their schedule so that they don't suffer on their education. For task givers, it will be easier to find a reliable person to do their job. Also, since the students would have cleared a background check, there will be a sense of safety and reliability. Business Model The business model will be a marketplace where two parties meet and conduct business, and the platform makes money by charging a commission. In this case, the task giver will post a job on the platform, and platform will provide a prospective list of service providers. The task giver will finalize the service providers by using a combination of quoted price and platform rating and will make the payment on the platform in an escrow account. After the task is completed and approved by the task giver, payment will be released to the service provider after deducting platform fees, which could be a percentage of the total price. Way to Market The first step will be to build a repository of service providers. For this marketplace can tie-up will colleges & universities and take a list of students available for different type of part-time jobs. You would need to onboard a third party verification provider to conduct the background check for the students. Now the chicken and egg story is, who will pay for the background check, the student or the platform? It will be good to structure a partnership with the third party verification provider and share a percentage of the revenue generated by the profile; this will ensure that the background checks are run every three months instead of it being a one-time activity. You can make this your unique selling proposition too. In addition to this, you may need to look at taking an umbrella insurance cover to indemnify your potential clients for any wrong doings by the service providers. You will have to structure pay as you go model with the insurance company. After you hit a critical mass, you should distribute the insurance cost among the service providers, as it protects them too from financial implications of a lawsuit and it reduces your financial burden. After that, the marketplace should market itself to the task givers. The founders can consider tying up with resident welfare associations of localities and organize seminars in various locations to talk about the marketplace and the services available on the platform. Milestones As mentioned above, the first step would be to have a repository of college students as service providers, along with the mapping of tasks they are able and willing to do. The first-year target should be to register up to 100,000 students on the platform, giving you a unique edge by building a community of college students, which will be hard to replace by next players. The second pit stop should be to reach 50 jobs per day, accumulating to 1500 jobs per month, By hitting this number you will be able to validate your business model in front of the investors to raise the subsequent round of funds. Investment needed for prototype For testing & building a prototype, pitch for raising $100k - $250k from Angel Investors or Incubators like 500 Startups or other locally active firms. There should be no office rental or salary payout, and the entire money should be dedicated to platform development and customer acquisition. Team Capability You would need a co-founder who has strong connections in colleges & universities, and another co-founder who is an expert in viral marketing. Investors / Expert Take The proposed Marketplace is a byproduct of the Peer-to-Peer or shared economy. This segment has been hot for investors in the last few years and being considered the future. The rapid emergence of the shared economy across the South-east Asia region is mainly due to the increase in Internet penetration. The growth of smartphone users and better Internet connectivity will give further impetus to the shared community and drive more engagement on the shared platforms in the times to come. $(""<div class='CL'></div>"").insertAfter("".clear_cls"") See all","I already  if you havent created a LinkedIn presence for your business, its time to stop ignoring it. LinkedIn isnt the old resume site you think it is; its transformed into a full blown business networking site with powerful marketing potential. And with the addition of just announced last week, business owners can now find even ways to take advantage of the site. The first of the new features is . This gives you the ability to target status updates to followers based on criteria like industry, job function, company size, etc. Similar to the way you can target Facebook updates to certain Lists or by demographic, now you can do the same on LinkedIn. Where might this be helpful? Its helpful if youre a local florist and youre creating content/updates related to an upcoming holiday or the summer wedding season. Its helpful if you sell blue widgets and youre trying to use content marketing to show Niche X why blue widgets are what they need to take their business to the next level. Its helpful if youre a consultant trying to increase your client base in a certain industry. If you can target updates to the right audience, it allows you to create more customized content for those niches. This helps to increase your relevance to people in that group, which in turn boosts engagement. The other new feature is called , which will provide detailed information about your follower base. For example, through the self-service dashboard youll have access to stats about demographic information, engagement, comments, follower counts, shares, etc. The new tools mentioned above will no doubt be welcomed by companies who use LinkedIn to build relationships, create new partnership, and even to scout for employees. But, too many companies using LinkedIn for these purposes. Instead, they stick their necks in the sand, wondering why someone would ever want to follow their business on LinkedIn in the first place. In doing so, they miss a valuable marketing opportunity. If youre not sure why someone might be looking to interact with you on a business network, consider this: People follow you on LinkedIn when theyre interested in your business and when theyre interested in doing business with your business. This is what you need to be thinking about developing your LinkedIn profile. These are the people watching. What benefits is your LinkedIn profile giving them? Will you take advantage of the new LinkedIn features once theyre rolled out? Are you using LinkedIn at all or are you still not sure its worth the investment?","Small businesses contracting with the federal government will be first to feel the effect of the sequester, the name for across-the-board federal budget cuts that went into effect in Washington Friday. For example, an estimated 35 percent of suppliers to the U.S. Defense Department are small businesses, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. In 2011, the department awarded 20 percent of its contracts and 35 percent of subcontracts to small firms. Those small businesses benefited at the time, of course. And all of their employees and subcontractors benefited too. However, those businesses now could have their contracts canceled or drastically reduced as the Defense Department and other federal agencies begin to make cuts. Small businesses also face the uncertainty of not knowing when or how their companies might be affected. Economics expert Dr. Stephen S. Fuller of George Mason University that the biggest problem is so many smaller firms may be suppliers or vendors for large, prime federal contractors without even knowing it. As a result, Fuller says these smaller firms could see sudden loss of business without warning. He estimates nearly half of a projected two million job losses resulting from the sequester could come from smaller firms. Not all small businesses with federal contracts are waiting around for the axe to fall, however. For example, software and high tech consulting company Geocent gets about 80 percent of its business from the Navy, the Air Force, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The company is working to diversify by increasing sales in the healthcare, financial, and insurance industries, Ryan Lemire, executive director at Geocent told the Associated Press. In October, Small Business Trends founder Anita Campbell explained beyond those with federal contracts. Deep federal budget could cause a ripple effect, resulting in reduced gross domestic product, unemployment, and recession. Meanwhile, Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business, insists to what he calls scare tactics by political leaders. See his take in the video below. Dunkelberg says the budget cuts will take time to implement and will be less damaging than a recent two percent increase in Social Security taxes in January. Small businesses must make efforts to move away from government contracts if possible, should the sequester continue. Business owners should also encourage their political leaders to end the sequester in Washington, but without tax increases that could be equally damaging to growth.","Theres been plenty of debate over the last several years about the pros and cons of flexible hours for workers. But whether businesses think it is a positive or a negative, its a concept that is becoming more commonplace in workplaces around the world. In fact, the U.K. a new law that allows workers to request flexible hours. The law states that any employee who has been with a company for at least 26 weeks has the right to request a flexible working arrangement. The employer must then deal with the request in a reasonable manner. This means they should allow the employee to state their case and offer an appeal if applicable. However, they can still deny the request if they have a good business reason for doing so. Previously, only parents and other caregivers had the legal right to request flexible working hours from their employers. But the recent changes have already made an impact on the UKs working landscape. According to a by conference calling service , 8 percent of UK workers submitted a flexible working request to their employer within a week of the law being enacted. And another 11 percent have said they definitely plan to do so. The survey also found roughly 35 percent of those surveyed said they might consider requesting flexible work hours at some point. These numbers arent exactly shocking  even here in the U.S. In fact, way back in 2011, Small Business Trends staff writer Rieva Lesonsky : Still, some employers have continued to worry about the impact on their businesses of a more flexible work schedule. Citing data, again from the UK, in 2013 David Wallace that: By contrast, employees have a completely different perspective. According to the data: In the end, however, employer concerns may be unwarranted. As Lesonsky : So, even if you do consider giving your employees more flexibility in their work schedules, be sure you dont end up burning your employees out by making them work much more in the process, Lesonsky suggests.","As weve mentioned many times before, .

Last year it introduced its own streaming service, ""HBO Now,"" and made its content accessible on Dish Network Corp's ( DISH.O ) Sling TV streaming service, which offers a small bundle of channels.  ""They want to ensure that the Turner networks have the broadest possible distribution without really compromising the traditional cable, satellite and telco channels,"" said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan. The investment also gives Hulu additional funding as it prepares to roll out a new live-streaming service, which is slated for early next year. Turner's networks, including TBS, Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies, will be available live and on-demand on Hulu's new service, Time Warner Inc said on Wednesday. The company raised its 2016 earnings forecast by 5 cents a share to a range of $5.35 to $5.45. Analysts on average were expecting $5.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Second-quarter revenue fell 5.3 percent to $6.95 billion from $7.35 billion, mainly due to a decline for the Warner Bros studio. Revenue from the Turner division rose 6.5 percent during the quarter. Revenue at HBO, which hosts the hit show ""Game of Thrones,"" was up 2 percent.  Time Warner's net income fell to $951 million, or $1.20 per share, from $971 million, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings of $1.29 per share beat the analysts' average estimate of $1.16.

Mashable has the (with screenshots) of the new Twitter console and theres lots of promising features to talk about. First off, dont get too excited: The TBC is currently only available to select accounts where Twitter has already turned on the switch, but its expected that the rollout will continue on a gradual basis. And, of course, some folks already have it. Mashable shows that a very small group of business owners have already started to receive emails inviting them to test the Twitter Toolkit. After receiving the invite, users can access a new Business tab in their settings to activate the features. Once there, businesses owners are asked to fill in some additional information about their company, including contact info and if they identify as a small business, large company or an individual/group. Here are some key features to look forward to: Overall, it looks like Twitter is taking some serious steps to making Twitter more business-friendly and giving companies the tools they need to better manage their accounts.  Theres no word on when the Twitter Business Center will be available to all users or if Twitter plans to charge for the new features.  I suspect well be hearing quite a bit more in the coming weeks about just what Twitters up to and how you can benefit as a small business owner. Stay tuned!","The business model of has been called one of the greatest ever developed. Its popularity has to do with its proven track record of success, and the relative ease in which people can become franchise business owners. Franchising contributes a sizeable amount of dollars to the U.S. economy, and some of the data that Ill be sharing with you here will bear that out. It used to be that folks would graduate from college, land a well-paying corporate job, and move up the ranks in the company until it was time to retire. Those were the days. Today, people are graduating and landing corporate jobs, but theyre finding themselves out of that job 4 years later.  (According to the , the median number of years that wage and salary workers had been with their current employer was 4.4 as of January 2010.) Is it any wonder that were seeing more and more people take a serious look at other career alternatives, including franchise ownership? A franchise typically involves the granting by one party (a franchisor) to another party (a franchisee) the right to carry on a particular name or trade mark, according to an identified system, usually within a territory or at a location, for an agreed upon term. The franchisee is granted a franchise license to use the franchise companys trademarks, systems, signage, software, and other proprietary tools and systems in accordance with the guidelines in the franchise contract. Not only must you run the business according to the operations manual and the franchise contract, but you must pay them an upfront franchise fee (license fee), and ongoing royalties. The average franchisee fee ranges from $25,000 -$35,000, although some franchise fees can go well over $100,000, as in the case of whats called a Master Franchise. In a Master Franchise, like , one buys the rights to an entire area, and its usually based on population. The royalties are usually based on a % of gross sales. Royalties range anywhere from 4%, like over at , a retail storefront type of franchise, all the way up to 9% as in the case of , an executive recruiting franchise. Some franchisors like Fantastic Sams, a hair salon franchise, charge a monthly royalty fee. In addition to royalties, franchisees usually pay into a national monthly advertising/marketing fund, which amounts to 1-2% of gross sales. According to a report put out by the IFA (International Franchise Association), franchising is huge. As of 2005; (Go to the to see the full report.)

With about 200 million monthly users and counting, Twitter can seem a bit overwhelming at times. As Lisa Barone explains, can be challenging: Fortunately, there are ways to increase your odds of getting heard at least by your target audience even with all the noise out there. Below are some tips you might want to consider to both crank up the volume of your Twitter account and fine tune your message to reach your target listeners. Data on Twitter and other social media channels seems to be everywhere. Start by examining some of this information to see what it can tell you about Twitter users in general. Every person is different, of course, but understanding who is using Twitter and a bit about their preferences may give you insight into how to craft your tweets. For example, social media software company Beevolve has data from 36 million Twitter profiles. And the results provide some major insights. For example, did you know the vast majority of Twitter users are young and that more women use the platform than men? The study shows the vast majority, 73.7 percent, of Twitter users are between the ages of 15 and 25 and 53 percent are female. How might this information affect the way you tailor your next Twitter message? You dont need to be a social media rock star to add major amps to your Twitter account. In fact, Twitters new promoted tweets are proving very effective at getting a message across. For example, when British Airways allegedly lost his fathers luggage, Chicago-based business man Hasan Syed paid more than the boost they needed. The effort paid off. Syed not only reached an estimated 50,000 Twitter users, his tweets were also picked up by major news media eventually bringing an apology from the airline. Imagine how far your message could reach. Sometimes the key to getting your tweets seen by your fans is to pay more attention to what your audience wants. As Lisa Barone explains: Youll likely need to try a lot of different approaches with your tweets in the beginning, just to find out what works. Then watch your audience and learn. Social media is all aboutwell, being social. Theres no point in trying to raise your voice unless youve found someone to talk to. For this, Lisa suggests some simple techniques. You can use keyword searches, look for people who have already retweeted one of your posts or find potential clients and customers on Twitter. Then, of course, chat them up, she suggests. Become part of their conversation, answer their questions or start a conversation of your own. Just get started! Just retweeting the latest news from your industry isnt enough. Remember, anyone can do that and there are probably plenty of them doing it already. The real art of tweeting effectively is to add a bit of your own distinctiveness in every 140 character message, says Lisa. To do this, you must include much more than simply the title of the article youre sharing and a link. Try to dig a little deeper. Try to share what you think about the post too. What does it mean? What do you as a thought leader in your field conclude from it? You may also want to pick out a quote, an interesting point or an important statistic from the post youre sharing. It will make your own tweet more memorable and sharable. Have any suggestions you could share about using Twitter more effectively?","ESO NASA's Juno probe just passed closer to Jupiter than any human-made craft ever. And no surprise, photos confirm that the fifth planet from the sun looks huge up close . Huge. It's so huge, in fact, that it doesn't actually orbit the sun. Not exactly. With 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets in the solar system combined, it's big enough that the center of gravity between Jupiter and the sun doesn't actually reside inside the sun - rather, at a point in space just above the sun's surface. Here's how that works. When a small object orbits a big object in space, the less massive one doesn't really travel in a perfect circle around the larger one. Rather, both objects orbit a combined center of gravity. In situations we're familiar with - like Earth orbiting the much-larger sun - the center of gravity resides so close to the center of the larger object that the impact of this phenomenon is negligible. The bigger object doesn't seem to move, and the smaller one draws a circle around it. But reality is always more complicated. For example: When the International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth, both the Earth and the space station orbit their combined center of gravity. But that center of gravity is so absurdly close to the center of the Earth that the planet's motion around the point is impossible to spot - and the ISS describes a near-perfect circle around the whole planet. The same truth holds when most planets orbit the sun. Sol is just so much larger than Earth, Venus, Mercury, or even Saturn that their centers of mass with the sun all lie deep within the star itself. Not so with Jupiter. The gas giant is so big that its center of mass with the sun, or barycenter, actually lies 1.07 solar radii from the middle of the sun - or 7% of a sun-radius above the sun's surface. Both the Sun and Jupiter orbit around that point in space. This not-to-scale gif from NASA illustrates the effect: That is, in essence, how Jupiter and the sun move through space together - though the distances and sizes are far different. Jupiter is still only a fraction of the sun's size. But next time someone asks you for a crazy space fact you'll know: Jupiter is so massive, it doesn't orbit the sun.

But its not necessarily one thats going to be popular with investors, given the experimental nature and length of time such a project is likely to take. is one company thats working to create cleaner sources of energy. Co-founders Dr. Leslie Dewan and Mark Massie have designed a technology that uses a hot salt mixture to dissolve uranium. This process could potentially eliminate the toxic waste that is created with the nuclear power we use today. It could also eliminate much of the risk for steam explosions. The potential for this new technology is great. But it couldnt be fully realized without some funding behind it. So, the company has spent the past year raising $6 million in funding for the project. Much of the moneycame from Peter Thiels Founders Fund, which was a perfect fit since the organization has the ability to be patient with its investments. And Transatomic Powers technology is likely at least 10 years away from being able to show any sort of return on investment. Dewan Fast Company: The investment should enable the team at Transatomic Power to get their technology past the experimental stage and to the point where it can actually be put into action. Currently, about 19percentof the electricity in the U.S. is generated using nuclear power. So this cleaner version has the potential to make a huge impact. It just takes some forward thinking scientists and investors who believe in their mission. Dewan said:","Imagine you could flip through Web pages, play videos or scroll down important documents with a simple hand gesture.A free download called Flutter for both Apple and Windows gives a glimpse of how gesture technology could improve productivity. For now, Flutter you to use gestures to control your video on YouTube and Netflix and music on Spotify, iTunes, Grooveshark and Pandora. The app uses the built in webcam on your desktop to read simple hand gestures for starting or stopping music or video. Heres a brief demonstration: Flutter announced being acquired by Google last week. TechCrunch the deal could be worth around $40 million. Writing about the acquisition on the official Flutter website, CEO Navneet Dalal : It is uncertain yet whether the Flutter team will go on developing and upgrading the companys existing product or bake their technology in to Google products like Google Glass, for example. Flutter is hardly the only company developing products using gesture technology. Other examples include PrimeSense, and (recently acquired by Intel.) But the acquisition is proof again that development of a single useful and revolutionary tool can catapult a small startup to a huge payoff.","Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 The startup idea is to aggregate the small messenger and delivery businesses in metropolitan cities. The startup will create the technology and provide same day messenger and delivery services to local business within metropolitan cities. Share Cancel Market Definition It is estimated by IBISWorld that the Global Courier and Delivery Services industry aggregates USD 242 billion in revenue. With the rise of the e-commerce businesses in the world, this space has seen a lot of activity. According to JLL, trade though ASEAN countries has increased significantly over the past decade, and the subsequent decade is predicted to see even greater growth in business, with volumes expected to increase by 130% in 2023 to USD 5,653 billion. This will have a significant impact on the logistics industry throughout the ASEAN community. ASEAN region is believed to have a combined economy of USD 2 trillion. According to Frost & Sullivan, ASEANs logistics industry expands rapidly, in line with the regions economic growth, slightly easing from 5.0% in 2013 to 4.7% in 2014. It is believed that Southeast Asia has been a major beneficiary of manufacturing moving from China and hence, the businesses in this region are expected to grow a lot. Indonesia is considered to be one of the best-performing economies in this region. With a population of more than 600 million, Southeast Asia is deemed to be a significant market for e-commerce, and yet it suffers from inadequate infrastructure. The same stands true for India; it is regarded as one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world and with a dismal platform in logistics. Competitor Analysis There are a lot of startups which are working in the area of same day delivery. It needs to be noted that the idea proposed intends to provide same-day delivery for local businesses within a city. There is skootar.com in Thailand which is only providing logistics services which could be provided on a bike. The idea contemplated in this article proposes that the startup will aggregate all the small logistics companies and make them available at the tap of a button in a mobile application. Pain Point & Target Audience The targeted customer market for this business is the local businesses which need to deliver goods or documents on the same day within the city. Currently, the delivery and messenger service market are highly unorganized in the Asian countries. There are a lot of small businesses which offer these services in a particular area in a city. The customer has to rely on the service providers in its locale and does not have the negotiation power. Value Proposition The startup will offer delivery services through a mobile application. The mobile application will be downloaded by the potential customers for booking deliveries. The mobile application will have a simple registration process and post the registration, the client's need to enter the area for pickup and drop along with the time of the delivery and will see a range of vehicle delivery options available. For example, for a document courier, the customer will select a motorbike and for delivery of furniture, the customer will choose a mini truck. Once the client selects the kind of vehicle, she will be provided with a list of delivery vendors providing the service along with the prices offered. At the end of service flow, the delivery providers would be rated by the customers. The entire process takes the power from the hands of the delivery vendors and gives it in the hands of the customers. Business Model This startup will work like Uber. The application will have two types of sign-ups, for vendors and clients. For every delivery booking, the startup will charge a fixed percent of the delivery charges as a commission from the vendors. Way to market The startup should start by identifying one city where it will start. It could be in any of the emerging market economies. Preferably, a town in Indonesia or Thailand or Malaysia or India, where there are a lot of small businesses, and there is a need for an organized setup for delivery services. The next step would be to list all the vendors in the city on the platform. Once the vendors are in place, the startup can market its product to the customers in all the markets. Milestones The key would be to prepare a sleek interface for the mobile application. The mobile application should be very user-friendly. Another key aspect should be to list all vendors in the market. One important thing that needs to be kept in mind by the founders is that the delivery industry will change drastically in the next few years with driverless cars and drones coming in to disrupt the whole industry. Therefore, the biggest plus point for any company would be the community of customers in the place. So once the community is in place, the startup can add that layer of technology. Investment Needed For Prototype For testing & building the prototype, pitch for raising 100K USD from angel investors or incubators active in your country. There should be no office rentals or salary payout; the entire budget should be apportioned for customer acquisition and technology. Team Capability You would need to have a tech expert who can oversee the technology and a marketing expert who can focus on creating the community of vendors and customers. The startup would have to make sure that the founders are working on specific roles. One of the founders should concentrate on building the community, and the other should make sure that the technology is improving every day. Investors / Expert Take Techinasia stated Investors also see Southeast Asias logistics market as the next gold rush. Thats made evident by the fact that 2015 saw more investments in regional logistics than ever before. The amount totalled US$28.16 million, according to the Tech in Asia database, up 110 percent from 2014. That growth in funding for logistics startups outpaced the overall tech funding landscape, which grew 43 percent to an all-time high of US$1.62 billion in 2015 from US$1.13 billion in 2014. Considering the above, there the funds could be watching this sector closely. This kind of a startup can potentially disrupt the delivery and courier industry and hence, if the startup can show initial traction, they may be the front-runners in this game. $(""<div class='CL'></div>"").insertAfter("".clear_cls"") See all","Small businesses continue to spur U.S. job growth. Companies with fewer than 50 employees created 45 percent of the 188,000 new jobs in June, a recently released ADP National Employment Report said. The 84,000 jobs created by small firms represent nearly half of the jobs created by U.S. businesses and the percentage of jobs created by small companies continues to grow. This is the second consecutive month for growth in job creation among smaller firms. In May, small businesses created 63,000 jobs, up from 57,000 in April. That month saw a major decline from Marchs 72,000 jobs added by smaller companies. Also, as in previous months, the smallest of the small represented the majority of small business job creation, the ADP Small Business Report said. Between May and June, 54,000 jobs were created by businesses with less than 20 employees. By comparison, businesses with 20-49 employees added 31,000 jobs during the same period. The results are part of an ongoing trend. In May, companies with between 1 and 20 employees created 37,000 of the 58,000 jobs credited to small businesses. And in April, businesses in the same category created 34,000 of the 50,000 jobs added by small businesses as a whole. As usual the largest job growth occurred in the service sector with small businesses creating about 70,000 of these jobs.The sector includes jobs pouring lattes but there are many other kinds of jobs and businesses represented as well. The service sector includes financial, professional and business services, but also includes employees like restaurant workers, housekeepers, teachers, health care workers and retail sales workers too. June also saw the largest increase of jobs in the goods producing sector in four months with 27,000 new jobs added, 14,000 among smaller companies. For small businesses, this sector includes mainly construction and manufacturing. Its obvious that companies with fewer than 50 employees continue to represent a growing percentage of jobs being created. Fifty full-time employees is the number at which businesses will be required under the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to provide medical benefits or pay a penalty per employee for not offering them by Jan. 1, 2015. Still, in a prepared statement (PDF), Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moodys Analytics, insisted: Has your small business added any jobs in the last few months? Do you have any plans to do so in the near future?","I thought I would make millions through my startup, but I failed miserably. I read shiny stories of Flipkart and Zomato, but nobody told me that 90 per cent of startups fail within two years. Mine failed in the first year. Sometimes, I feel cheated but also acknowledge the fault was mine. I had believed only one side of the story.Today, I am going to tell you the other side of the story. It was April 2013 when I started getting uncomfortable at my workplace. Thoughts of leaving the boring job were taking over and I was losing interest in my work.I had just returned from the US, and I asked my manager for some time in the pretext of setting up my home in India again. Truth be told, however, my real problem was unhappiness from my job. I dreamt of starting something on my own but did not have the courage.I discussed with a friend and we decided to start a company. I put all of my savings in my startup.The first step we took was incorporating a private limited company and investing Rs five lakh each and dividing equity equally. We found a basement office in Gurgaon. We wanted to solve problems related to schools, as we thought education is a billion-dollar industry. We thought we could build any product for schools and make big profits.After long discussions, we came up with the idea of ERP for schools; online software to manage everything from fees and inventory to communication with parents. I was confident that we could easily hire people. We had everything going to build a good team: an office, money in bank account, hiring policy and most importantly a co-founder with recruitment experience of more than ten years.We met a few people we were interested in hiring. But, to our surprise, not one person wanted to join our startup! My co-founder remarked, Since we were from the corporate background, we spent few days on drafting new hiring policy. We introduced company incentives based on revenue and individual performance bonus along with basic salary. We moved to our new office. We hired a fresher and after a lot of struggle we found someone who impressed us with his technical capabilities but we were doubtful of his managerial and leadership skills. He was a costly hire. We offered him salary plus company incentives if we made any revenue by the end of the year.We were feeling lucky with two developers. I architect the product and developers started coding without waiting for the front-end design. It was an exciting time. Our product was taking shape. We managed to hire a designer but we compromised a lot with his skillset and attitude. We started feeling the heat of startup hiring.We wanted to complete the product as soon as possible so that we could start selling. Then we started facing unexpected problems. Our junior developer was not performing up to our expectations so we had to ask him to leave. With a team of just four people, we completed the first version of our product. We were confident that our product will sell like hot cakes once it will hit the market. We included all the features of top ERP products in the market to beat the competitors. However, we were not happy with the front end design and were continuously looking for a better designer. Our first potential client (a known school principal) appreciated our idea and demo but put us on hold till she could hear from higher management. We sent her the sales material and thought we will deploy software in a few months.          We decided to move our development office to Chandigarh where I would manage operations and my co-founder would handle sales by staying at Gurgaon. This helped us. ur designer scooted with the laptop. We tracked him and recovered the laptop, but lost our only designer. I took the challenge and learnt the basics of web designing. We revamped the entire design in one month. The product came out nicely. We started reaching out to schools but neither of us co-founders came from a sales background. We hired a person from Ahmedabad for sales training,but we were unable to sell our product even with more features and less cost, compared to competitors. We found a few customers by leveraging references, but revenue was far away. My co-founder who took care of the sales said that some big schools wanted to buy our product if we could implement few more features. I had a different opinion. I argued that we had enough features for any school to get started and there was something missing in the sales process. I thought we should focus on small to medium schools even if we earn less money. Conflict between us started arising. We started running out of money, so we invested more into our startup.We hired a sales person from a big competitor.We felt we'd found the silver bullet because he gave us access to our competitor's product and told us the secrets of doing sales to schools.He worked with us for a month but could not crack even a single sale. His impressive sales record with the competition was due to the brand name. We needed more money to survive. My co-founder was busy chasing big schools that can pay good money in advance. He also started establishing contacts with political and influential people to win deals. I started reading startup blogs and books and believed in lean startup methodologies and doing more with less resources. Unfortunately, my co-founder was still building our startup like a big corporate. I proposed to reduce our expenses. But our vision was not aligned.At last, my co-founder took over the company and promised to return my cash if the company made any profits in the future.         By now we had wasted more than Rs 15,00,000 on a product that nobody wanted to purchase. We had only two paying customers, few on trial and a lot in the sales funnel.After a few more weeks of struggle, my co-founder had to join a job. This was the end for SchoolGennie. Let me share what I learnt along the way: We built our product based on the assumptions and feature lists of our competitors. We should have talked to our customers before building our product. We spent most of the money on office infrastructure and employee salaries. We could have avoided 80% of expenses by working from home and hiring employees on survival salary + ESOPs. We were avoiding expenses on the professional design of sales material, marketing tools, and paid consultancy. . Non-technical co-founders remain clueless of technical know-hows. I advise you to start coding even if you are non-technical. There might be some exceptions but generally a non-tech co-founder can take better decisions if he knew how things get implemented. Joel, co-founder of Buffer shares . I was afraid of doing sales because I thought my co-founder is better at communication and public speaking. We were unable to close sales despite his good communication and HR background. The main reason was that we were not talking about the pain points of the customer but just trying to hard sell our product. The sales process is not just about good public speaking but addressing the concerns of the customer. We started postponing tough decisions like spending budget of sales, hiring or firing an employee, offering equity to the employees, chasing big schools or small schools, offering a free solution or charge premium, and at last how to go our separate ways. Since the closure of my first venture, I started taking firm decisions based on the available information at that time. You can never have 100% data available for taking any decision. You should be smart enough to derive a conclusion with 60-70% information and fill the gap with your intuition. Alarm bells ring for a startup when someone starts behaving like an expert and refuses to learn new things. You are doomed to fail if you stop learning. I learned it very late, but some of you may have realised this by now. We entrepreneurs start a venture to solve a customers problem or to explore our passion, and money is just fuel for our startup vehicle.If you focus on money, you would become short-sighted. The most important lesson from my entrepreneurial journey  be generous, be polite, be a giver. This was the story of my first startup, but I feel most first-time entrepreneurs are on a similar path. I joined another startup as co-founder and . Now I am working with startups to help them unlock growth.

But his words should have networkers ears as well. When you start a business, you make choices. But how do you know youre acting as an entrepreneur and developing the unique values of a sustainable business? Johnson should know. He founded Johnson Media during his sophomore year in Morehouse College in Atlanta. Now, 13 years later, Johnson Media has grown to manage multi-million dollar marketing and communication contracts for many Fortune 100 firms. I learned about the book after following Johnsons tips and ideas shared on Twitter. Knowing the value he has brought to the social media world with his observations, I was too happy to finally have those observations in a book format for review. The book is based from Kevins blog yet incorporates new insights. The text is organized into seven subjects: The thesis behind the text is meant to guide young entrepreneurs away from major mistakes and miscues. Take this perspective of what creates a business failure. There are other nuggets, such as reflections on managing ego in business: Another perspective gives a starting point for vetting clients: Johnson also tempers some misconceptions about starting a business, such as the falsehoods that arise from being your own boss: This book complements business books marketed towards African American business owners, like Dante Lees , as well as books examining a broad workplace influence such as . Some situations may read as too specific for general advice, but no suggestion comes across as entirely alien to a budding business. Johnsons dealing with a bounced check is an example. A mentor taught him how to properly verify if a customers check really had sufficient funds behind it. This is a solid note about selecting the right mentor. Examples like the check incident will raise a been-there thought from readers who know how to sustain a business. The point of books like this is to accelerate the experiences that instruct ones judgment. Your extrapolation from Johnsons tips will be as useful as your imagination.

The number of new construction businesses created in the previous three months declined from 27,000 in March of 2006 to 17,000 in March 2013, according to Bureau data. Thats a 37 percent drop. And its much higher than the 12 percent slide in the rate of new business startup overall. It would be easy to attribute the decline in the rate of new construction firms to the bursting of the housing bubble. After all, housing prices peaked in early 2006 and have only modestly recovered. With housing prices in the dumps, we should expect few would-be entrepreneurs to go into construction. That could explain the decline in construction start-ups in recent years. Unfortunately, the numbers indicate that just isnt the case. The rate of construction company startups has lagged behind other sectors of the economy since well before the housing bubble burst. Bureau numbers show that the founding of new companies overall rose 26 percent between June 1993 and March 2006. Over the same period, the number of new construction companies increased at only half that rate. Even during the housing boom, it seems, the number of construction start-ups was growing relatively slowly. More importantly, new firm creation in the construction sector has been on a long-term decline. Census Bureau data reveal that the number of construction start-ups fell a whopping 79 percent between 1977 and 2011, the latest year data are available. Thats the largest fall of any of the nine primary sectors of the economy. Moreover, the rate of formation of construction start-ups has been declining consistently since the mid-1990s. As a result, the number of American construction companies peaked in 2000, and in 2011, was 34 percent lower than its highest level. The recent rise in housing starts is a small blip on a long-term downward trend in entrepreneurship in the construction sector. It may signal short-term improvement for those in the industry. But it doesnt suggest that would be entrepreneurs will move back into the sector over the next decade.","Todays franchise business systems need to run smoothly and efficiently. Franchisees, the people who are footing the bill for the system, expect the system to work.

Recently, thecompanyteamed up with GoPro to live stream from your GoPro to your phone, and now we have so many new emojis. This gets my inner adrenaline junkie revving and makes me excited aboutwhat content I can produce this winter. Katch.me How do these new platforms, tools and the use of live streaming play into your content marketing efforts? Both of these platforms give you the opportunity to build an audience quickly. Meerkat allows you to build an audience quickly because of what I call the follow up. After a Meerkat stream, you can follow up with those who engaged with you on the stream in Twitter. Periscope allows you to build an audience quickly mostly due to its massive native audience. Other bonuses are that any user can watch a replay and their is a convenient world map where users can follow streams around the world. Bottom line, both platforms have their advantages and disadvantages. That being said, ultimately the bigger your audience the more opportunities to sell yourself and your product. Those who master live streaming video content will win customer attention in 2016 and beyond Since February 14, 2005 YouTube has dominated the video world. But more importantly it sparked a revolution of user created video content. Video content has always been deemed the highest value in comparison to other pieces of content like blog articles. Which piece of content do you think would be consumed more, an ebook explaining how to change your motor oil or a video explaining how to change your motor oil? The video, of course! Now what would be better? Watching a video of someone changing the motor oil on YouTube, or watching a live mechanic change the oil who you can ask questions while he does it? Im going to say youd probably prefer the live tutorial. This is the real power of live-streaming. It is the ability to create personalized unique content and interactions with your audience at scale. This part is quite simple. Start a stream with Meerkat, Periscope, or both, and use With a topic in mind for the stream, talk and engage with your audience. Maybe you are discussing ways to build your Meerkat audience, for example. After you are done with your stream, Katch.me will record your stream and post itto YouTube. Download the videos, splice them up and distribute the new video back on your own personal YouTube channel. How convenient is that? A content upgrade relates to your topic but helps users dive in deeper. If you have the time in your calendar, I highly suggest streaming every day. Setting aside a time every day for 90 minutes to stream helps you grow your audience rapidly. It also gives you a plethora of material to use in other media. Most of us already have an intense content calendar with interviews, Q and As, podcasts and blog articles. Instead of getting overwhelmed with a new platform, start thinking, Can I double dip? While you are conducting an interview or doing a podcast, can you stream on Meerkat/Periscope? When you are working on a blog article, how about streaming and asking for expert quotes or stats? During your down time, can you live stream? Not every stream has to be about pushing your business. Connecting with your audience and showing your personality is also important. Are you having a drink at the local pub with your mates? Why not whip out your phone and stream. Watching the Premier League? Stream a rowdy discussion about who is going to win the match. Like to spend time walking around sightseeing? Bring an eager tour group with you on your phone. Some of your best content can come from random chance streams. Creating amazing content is the first step in your content marketing strategy. The second step is to get people to actually pay attention. Everyone in business is stepping up their game and making the best content is getting harder than ever. Getting people to pay attention to your content and take action is even more challenging. Live streaming enables you to cut through all the noise or competition. If your content is solid, it will get shares and more people in the stream. The more attention you can create for yourself and your brand, the more opportunities you have in business. When you have created an amazing stream that gets tons of social shares and many users paying attention, you can ask for the engagement. Need people to share a blog post? Ask people to share it. Just launched a digital product? Ask people to buy it. The more value you create upfront, the easier it is to drive engagement. This is the entire thesis behind the book Jab Jab Jab Right Hook, by Gary Vaynerchuk. Go check it out if you havent read it yet.

And while Google and others has lead the way when in driving Internet ad revenue, social media and ad technologies like re-targeting is expected to surpass search ad revenues by 2015. Mary Lou Song, co-founder and CEO of video advertising platform Fuel451, shares how small business can use the power of ad technology along with their video content to help them find more customers  without breaking the bank. * * * * * Ive been in the technology space for about the last 20 years. I was the third employee at eBay, and thats actually where I got my first taste of technology and the power of tech for small businesses. A few years ago, I started a company with my brother and we decided to look at video and advertising technology for small businesses, and thats what were working on right now with FUEL451. A couple of years ago what we were finding was that a lot of small businesses were really anxious to try video with their business. And so they went out and invested a lot of time and energy, and sometimes some pretty decent dollars, into creating videos to promote their businesses. Butonce the video was made, they would put it up on YouTube and then forget about it. So what we wanted to do was say, Youve made that heavy investment in the video, but the best way you can actually take that and re-purpose it would be to actually turn it into an advertisement for your company. For us, any ad unit is basically one single ad or advertisement that is used across the Internet to promote your business. So for us, the ad unit is created from all of your visual assets. We take your video, your logo, the message that you want to actually give to your customer, and we put all of those things into a single advertisement. Thats what we use to promote your business. So when I say ad units, thats what were actually talking about. You might actually hear two different terms in the advertising space. You might hear the term re-targeting, or you might hear the term re-marketing. And all that is, is this notion of when somebody comes to your site, you follow them or track them with ads about your business. So, let me give you an example. If youve ever been to say the Nordstrom website, and youve looked at Nike shoes, anad of Nike shoes then follows you wherever you go on the Internet. Youre constantly being reminded of those Nike shoes. That is called re-targeting or re-marketing. Nordstrom is trying to remind you of those Nike shoes and get you back to the site. Re-marketing should be part of the healthy advertising that you do for your site or your business. But at FUEL451 we say thats a good starting point, but thats not the end-all-be-all of what you should be doing to keep a healthy digital advertising strategy for your business. We actually track your customers and we track them with re-targeting first. But what were doing is gathering up all of the information and the data that we possibly can about your healthiest customers and use that data to inform you who your target or your new customers should be. Thats exactly right. I think that there are two trends every small business should be aware of. One trend is the video trend and how important that is to sales and conversion rates, and even increasing the trust factor between a business and its customers. But the second big trend that I think small businesses should be engaging in and using to their advantage is this notion of data. What we are trying to do is wrap that into our offering with FUEL451. So what we want to do is not just stop with the video and the re-targeting. The data that we can actually gather for a small business about their customers, all of that data needs to be leveraged to find new customers. Thats exactly right. Now, the idea of that is not new. Thats what big companies have been doing for years. But the way that we have built our technology, it makes this whole thing possible for a business of any size. Any business of any size should be tracking their customers. That, to me, is first and foremost and actually more important than launching an advertising campaign. We tell all of our customers and our clients that regardless of your size, we want to start tracking your customers as soon as possible. So even if youre starting off and youve got maybe one or two customers, or a couple of hits a day to your site, that data youre getting about your customer base is a gold mine for you. We want to be there to help you mine that gold and use that to inform who you should be looking at next. I know if you go to some agencies, or if you went to an ad network, they might say if you dont get 5,000 hits a month, or 5,000 hits a day, youre too small to be doing this. But the way that weve built our technology is size agnostic. We are here to help everybody learn whatever they can about their own customer base, and can use that data that they gather to really target new customers because thats really what were all after. Thats exactly right. We are watching what they do on your site, off of your site, what interests them, what are the behaviors that characterize your business and its customers. And what were doing is looking for those patterns in that behavior that we can leverage and use to match other Internet users who are out there that should be targeted as potential customers for you. Our site, which is Fuel451.com. And, of course, they can always call me or call any one of my team and were happy to help out.","If you have a company blog, you may also have the commenting platform powering it. But now the company is  Disqus sponsored comments. And it is getting a very mixed response from users. Disqus Sponsored comments  both text and graphic based  will be a way of introducing advertising not to the main part of a page or post, but instead next to a comment hosted on Disqus. According to the company, ads wont be placed next to just any comment. Instead, they will be placed in the same area as what Disqus calls a featured comment  pinned to the top of the thread. A featured comment is one which the publisher feels is good, insightful, well written, adds to the conversation, whatever. The publisher pins it to the top of the thread to give it more exposure. The sponsored comment can be upvoted or downvoted, just like any other Disqus comment. The brand behind the comment will initially be able to target sites in their particular market. So Nike can target sports sites or shoe sites. Vodafone can target cellphone sites, that sort of thing. However, , one troubling aspect of the whole idea is that the brand will be able to moderate the feedback on their sponsored comment. So any critical ones will naturally be hidden from view. Disqus says it feels running ads alongside the featured comment does not disturb the conversation, and puts the ad at the beginning like movie previews. In other words, its not what you are there to see, but its something extra to benefit from. The new ad feature is being portrayed as both a way for brands to engage in conversations they want to be a part of. Its also a way for publishers to make money off of their social engagement. Disqus will have a dedicated team to moderate all sponsored comments, to ensure quality. Publishers can also set up their own filters. And those who really dont want to participate can turn the ads off on their site. However, this has not placated some rather annoyed users who have taken to the Disqus comment thread to voice their displeasure. As one commenter sarcastically , I cant WAIT to read more about that cousin that makes 2000 dollars a week on the internet.","When daredevil Felix Baumgartner jumped from a balloon hovering just inside the Earths stratosphere, a small enterprising firm made sure we were all along for the ride.

(And let us all breathe a sigh of relief as his parachute opened and his feet finally touched ground.)

Or do you need to attract new workers to help with growing demand for your product or service, or to expand your business? In either case, employee benefits are an important factor in whether employees choose to join your company, stay with your business for the long haul or jump ship. How do you know if your employee benefits measure up? can offer some insights. While the majority of companies responding to the survey had over 100 employees, some 22 percent were small businesses. Below is a look at the basic benefits most companies were offering, plus some extras that could give you an edge. Health insurance is an important benefit for employees, and its offered by almost every business. The most common health benefit was prescription drug coverage, offered by 98 percent of companies. Ninety-six percent provide dental insurance, and 86 percent offer PPO healthcare coverage, while 33 percent provide an HMO plan. Preventive or wellness programs have been on the rise over the last five years, SHRM notes. These offerings, which can help cut health-care costs, can range from bonuses or incentives for reaching health goals (such as quitting smoking) to wellness coaching or subsidized gym membership. About two-thirds of companies offer some type of wellness program. Retirement is another big issue on employees minds as they struggle to recover from the recession. Employer-sponsored retirement plans are shifting toward defined contribution retirement savings plans and 401(k) savings plans. Nearly all (92 percent) of employers offer a defined-contribution retirement savings plan, and 73 percent provide an employer match to employees contributions. More companies are offering investment assistance, from online advice (59 percent) to one-on-one investment advice (53 percent) and specific retirement-preparation advice. Incentive bonus plans are offered by 55 percent of companies Employee referral bonuses, for referring a job candidate who is hired and passes the probationary period, have gained in popularity over the last year and are now offered by 47 percent of companies. The majority (53 percent) of companies offer some form of flextime. Fifty-one percent allow flextime during core business hours, while 26 percent offer it outside of core business hours. Even more popular is telecommuting, which 58 percent of companies offer in some form, whether ad-hoc (45 percent), part-time (36 percent) or full-time (20 percent) Over one-third (35 percent) of companies offer compressed workweeks, where full-time employees can work longer days for part of a week or pay period in exchange for shorter days or a day off during that week or pay period. Nearly all (90 percent) companies provide professional memberships, 85 percent provide off-site professional development opportunities and 78 percent pay for certification fees. Just 44 percent of companies offer cross-training in skills not directly related to the job, and a mere 20 percent offer mentorship. Whatever employee benefits you offer, SHRMs report recommends three steps to getting the most from them as a recruitment and retention tool: Past SHRM research shows flexibility is a very low-cost way to drive increased employee job satisfaction, lower turnover and lower insurance costs. SHRM studies show employees consistently rank benefits among the top contributors to their job satisfaction, but many employees dont fully understand all of their benefits, their value and their options. Make sure you communicate, through meetings, workshops and other means, about the worth of what youre giving employees and how they can maximize their benefits value. Toot your own horn. Review your benefits at least once a year to make sure theyre still competitive with other businesses, that their costs are in line, andmost of allthat theyre serving employees needs. Getting employee feedback is an important part of this assessment.","If you are one of those people who only uses Twitter via a tool such as Hootsuite, you may have missed all the image-related improvements made on Twitter in recent months.

I dont even know these people and worse, they dont know me. They have no idea if I have a need for their product/service.It seemed they made assumptions based on what they could see in my profile. This is the worst kind of cold calling. Its like dialing for dollars. What it seems these people did was search LinkedIn for people who meet certain criteria. Once found, they requested connections. And then, once connected, they sent their most salesy LinkedIn email to those people. You know the kind. It goes like this: Ugh! So, what exactly did that have to do with me as a prospect and what I might need? Nothing. It was all about what they wanted and needed. I disconnected. Its like getting those solicitor calls or spam emails  only worse. Its worse because I have access to much more information about them. I can see them, so to speak. They arent anonymous. I have the opportunity to build a belief about them  a belief that does not instill trust. If I want to, I could even investigate their profile. I could see who they are connected to and build a belief system around those people as well. When we understand that sales is about building relationships and trust, we can see how this policy is full of problems. You cant go from introduction to marriage. You cant go from connection to a sale. There is work that must be done in between to build a relationship, learn about the prospect, and identify whether they are qualified. Do they need what you have to sell? Can you help them solve a problem? Once you know the answers to these questions and have developed a trusting relationship with the prospect you can do business with them  and not until then. LinkedIn is a wonderful platform for building relationships and sharing your expertise. And there is a way to effectively prospect on LinkedIn. When you are looking for an introduction into a company or to an individual, you can see how you are connected to them by using the advanced search function on LinkedIn. When you see a shared connection you can then ask that connection to introduce you. The key to the success of this tactic is to with the people you are linked to. When you already have their trust, they will be happy to introduce you to others. It is my opinion that this is the only way you should be using LinkedIn to prospect. It is not a cold calling platform. Take an inventory of how you are using LinkedIn and how others are interacting with you. Make very clear and purposeful decisions about how you are going to build relationships with your contacts. This is how you will realize the true benefit of the business development opportunities of LinkedIn  and wont run the risk of being disconnected.","The U.S. Federal Trade Commission says that a contest asking customers to pin photos of a brands product on Pinterest violated the Federal Trade Act. , a seller of shoes, bags and accessories, had offered a $1000 shopping spree as the prize for the   contest. In a letter to Cole Haans legal team,Mary K. Engle, associate director of advertising practices for the FTC, spelled out the specifics of the contest : In the letter, Engle said the commission had been most concerned with the apparent lack of disclosure in the contest. She added: Engle went on to say that the commission considered the inclusion of the #WanderingSole with each submission insufficient to disclose the financial incentive between contestants and Cole Haan. Think of it this way. I want you to publicize my new T-shirt design to your followers on Pinterest. I could just ask you, of course. You and about 100 other people I might know. But a way to give you more incentive would be for me to offer say, $1,000 as a prize to the person who posts the most images of my new T-shirt design to Pinterest. The trouble is that other people who see you posting images of my T-shirt design may have no idea that youre posting these images, not because you think my T-shirts are cool, but because youre trying to win $1,000. Despite being convinced the contest violated federal trade law, the FTC has decided not to pursue an enforcement action. The commission says its decision is based on the short run of the contest and the limited participation it generated. But Engle wrote that Cole Haan has also been cooperative about establishing a social media policy addressing the commissions concerns. Nevertheless, Greg Sterling, contributing editor at Marketing Land rightly that the ruling will have a significant impact. This will especially be the case when brands think about how they interact with users on Pinterest. And that may be true for interaction on other social media channels, too. Be sure to disclose any financial incentives you have been given for endorsements you make on your blog or on social media, of course. But be sure you encourage others who have received incentives from you to do the same.","Admit it: None of us are as graceful as we think we are. Weve all stepped in it so-to-speak and sometimes, the results arent pretty. Whether were out for a run or walking within the confines of our home, weve all had a clumsy moment with unintended consequences. Likewise, no matter how appropriately you run your business, if youve been in business long enough, then youre bound to receive publicity you dont like. Meet Nivia, the focus of todays case study. After releasing its   ad campaign, Nivia was criticized for undertones that many claimed were racist. The ad prominently featured a clean-shaven black man tossing away a head with an afro and facial hair, implying that he was throwing away his old-self to   himself. Fortunately, Nivia has become a role model of how small businesses should handle a public relations crisis and negative PR situations, immediately and other platforms. Nivia then removed the ad and suspended the campaign due to the widespread backlash. If your business becomes the center of unwanted controversy and a public relations crisis, its important to know how to react. Whether warranted or unwarranted, its important to remain calm while handling any sort of controversy online. If your brand did nothing wrong, such as Cheerios in their recent Just Checking ad (seen below), then theres no reason to withdraw any of your campaigns or apologize for a wrongdoing. However, if theres legitimate dicey-ness such as in the Nivia campaign, youll certainly want to react as quickly as possible without a knee-jerk reaction. Remember, can cause more damage. Sometimes its better to stay quiet and avoid making the situation worse than to try and give a lengthy explanation and apology. Just like avoiding a knee-jerk reaction, sometimes less is more. Especially when your brand is under heightened scrutiny. When it comes to new marketing strategies and campaigns, sometimes we get so excited in the potential value that we forget to consider any potential pitfalls. Just as you might trip while walking because you werent paying attention, many controversies happen because marketers didnt fully consider or understand the dynamics of a campaign. Ultimately, the best way to handle controversy is to prevent it.But just as Cheerios learned, sometimes controversy is unwarranted and can come swiftly from various sects of the online community. By handling a public relations crisis and controversy appropriately and gracefully, your brand will be able to establish itself as one of the most professional in its industry.","If your business is looking for an affordable smartphone, it may soon be time to buy. Google has discounted its Google Nexus 4 Android smartphone. The price drop was announced last week on the Google Play Twitter feed. Google is essentially taking $100 off the already inexpensive smartphone, making the 8GB model $199 and the 16GB $249. Unfortunately, the discount seems to have temporarily depleted inventory of the phone at the Google Play store. A notice Monday morning disappointed bargain shoppers to check back soon. The markdown may be a sign that a new release from Google is on the way. It may also be a response to a rumored budget iPhone from Apple that could be as early as next week. At first glance the Google Nexus 4 is already a highly attractive phone for the money. The device has a glass front and back and 4.7-inch screen with 1280 by 768 resolution. It also features an 8 megapixel camera on the back and a 1.3 megapixel camera on the front. Downsides, according to a review by Joshua Topolsky of The Verge below, include lack of 4G LTE which makes for significantly slower data download in most cases. The lack of this feature means the phone is really not competitive with, say, the iPhone 5. (Of course, youll want to disregard the prices quoted for the phone in the video since theyre much lower now with the discount.) Also the glass front and back are easy to break, if you drop the phone. However, the cameras and other features seem good and the phone is also available unlocked so you can use it with almost any carrier.","Offering a quality product or service is essential for success in any business. But if you run a local business, that alone might not be enough. You also need to create an atmosphere within the business that customers will want to be a part of. Thats the aspect of business that Phil Jaber focused on when launching in San Francisco in 2002. He WeWork: Now, there are 14 locations throughout the Bay Area. And at each one, Jaber manages to create a one of a kind experience for customers. His goal is to create more than just a place to have coffee, but a place for people to meet, socialize, and enjoy a sense of community. Since launching the first Philz Coffee location back in 2002, he seems to have succeeded in that goal. Hes gained somewhat of a cult following among coffee lovers in the Bay area. And couples have even gotten married in his shops. So how does he manage to create this community in each local shop? Part of that secret lies with Jaber himself, who has had a passion for both coffee and entrepreneurship from a young age. He began selling coffee to passersby from his familys front yard at the age of eight. Then he helped his dad run a market while growing up, spending his spare time experimenting with coffee blends and conducting market research for his future shop. But another part of Jabers success lies in the hiring process. Jaber said he makes sure to hire employees who have the same values and tastes. And then he gives them enough freedom to be creative, provided they treat customers with respect. Employees are called Artists instead of Baristas and are encouraged to provide personalized service to help build that sense of community in each location. But the one part of the business that Jaber said has helped build a sense of community more than any other is, of course, the quality of the product. Jaber insists that if a product is great enough, it can create a one-of-a-kind experience that makes people happy. And that, in turn, helps foster a sense of community in the business. He said:","There was a time when cloud storage was seen as a passing fad, not destined to last long. But in fact, the opposite has happened, with everyone embracing it for their files, and shunning the computer hard-drive. And now, online storage costs are plummeting fast, which is good news for businesses. Theres no better example of this than Googles that its the cost of its Drive storage. The price for 1 terabyte of data dropped from $49.99 a month to just $9.99 a month. (No, that is not a typo.) 100 gigabytes went right down to $1.99 a month, which is definitely affordable on any budget. , a whole terabyte of data would have been unthinkable less than a decade ago. Just the very idea of it would have been unbelievable or laughable. But now Google is offering you exactly that for a mere $10. And that Google is probably offering these prices to get people onto the Drive platform where its productivity apps reside. This, of course, puts a serious squeeze on rivals such as Dropbox, OneDrive, and Box. Until Googles announcement, OneDrive was barely in the lead, price-wise, ahead of the other services. Now it has been caught wrong-footed, just weeks after . If your business needs storage space in the cloud, then your options continue to expand. There to consider. And lower costs arent the only benefit to be looking out for. For example, companies like Dropbox are rapidly enhancing their features with the ability to manage accounts across multiple devices. Theres also the option to for . While these features are extremely useful, Dropboxs cause isnt helped , in comparison to its rivals. that it is only a matter of time before the other cloud services respond to Googles business strategy of slashing prices to pennies. So if you think that your favorite cloud storage service is currently too expensive, then be patient. You may see that price tumbling before you know it. And often, paying the whole year up-front gives you a further 15%-20% off. Theyre practically giving it away.","If youre still looking for ways to make sense of the overwhelming amount of information and feedback thats coming through on social networks, then may have some answers and insights for you. This is a book I was eager to read because it focuses on how technology intersects with real life strategy. The first thing I did was look for the . I find thats an easy way to get an overview and start developing an opinion. I also love it when books have blogs because the blog provides updates and new information that may not have made the printed version. However, I think youll find to be extremely current. is a practical book with an academic twist. Thats because the author, David L. Rogers ( ), is a teacher at Columbia Business School and the Executive Director at the Center of Global Brand Leadership. The practical part of the book comes from Rogers observations during his BRITE conferences and smaller leadership summits that Rogers noticed that many of the best and most innovative technical ideas werent coming from technical companies. Hes taken these experiences and distilled them into the five srategies that will help you thrive in a digital age. I call that the academic twist because Rogers uses his experience and skill in synthesizing information and then delivering it in a way you can learn from and adapt into your business. If youre still wondering how you are going to leverage all the social media and technology tools to help you achieve your objectives, then you will breathe a sigh of relief when I tell you that the core message of this book is to focus on your customers , not the technology or the social media tool. Rogers has distilled five behavior strategies that small business can focus on in order to leverage networked customer behaviors to create happier, more loyal customers. Be Faster, Be Easier, Be Everywhere, Be Always On Become a Source of Valued Content Make Your Offering Adaptable to Your Customers Needs Become a Part of Your Customers Conversations Involve Your Customers at Every State of Your Enterprise Ill admit that Im a little biased against books written by academics. Maybe Im biased for the same reason that you might be: the impression that they dont live in the same world as we do. Academics have the reputation of thinking big thoughts, interacting with big companies and not really understanding small business owners. In this case, Rogers academic experience is a real asset to the reader who is trying to tie together an overwhelming number of disparate ideas to actually create effective strategies. He does an outstanding job of giving a contextual overview, then focusing on each strategy and then providing specific real-life, familiar examples that you can look at. As I read through the book, I found myself thinking, Take the Customize examples here: is to overall marketing strategy what was to social media. These two books focus on slightly different aspects of networking. Yet, they both do something that few business books can do: help you get your arms around the technology and the strategy in a way that actually makes sense and helps you take action. Im glad I have this book on my shelf, and I intend to get some more copies to pass on to clients and colleagues who want to get smart very quickly about how to best integrate technology with sound marketing strategy.","New to Twitter? Still learning how to build your following and engage existing followers? Twitter can be an incredibly useful tool, but it can easily become a wasted resource if youre not using it correctly. Here are 10 common Twitter mistakes your business should avoid: Tweeting about your business is OK, as long as youre doing so in moderation. As with all social media, Twitter is a medium for conversation. Its important to be adding value to the general conversation. If youre tweeting the latest piece of useful content or pertinent event information, your followers will know how great you are without your having to say it outright. Twitter moves quickly. As of June 2012, Twitter was at . With that many tweets streaming through your followers Twitter feeds, there is a great chance your tweet will be missed. Many businesses try to combat this by repeating the same tweet 50 times per day. That is just too much repetition and your followers will grow tired of you. You want to make sure your followers are seeing your tweets, but you want to be cautious of too much repetition. If its a very important tweet and I want to make sure it is seen, I like to repeat it a couple times a day for a few days, but not much more. ReTweeting yourself equates to liking your own Facebook posts. We know youre proud of the content youre tweeting, you dont need to retweet yourself to prove it. When you want to repeat a tweet, dont be lazy. Find a new way to describe the content with each tweet. As I mentioned above, you can repeat tweets in moderation. Take the time to compose a new tweet when re-sending the same link from an earlier tweet. Dont just retweet yourself over and over again or you will lose followers. Somebody finally mentioned your brand on Twitter! This can be very exciting. A common response is to just retweet the great thing someone said about you. In the real world, would you go around repeating the compliments youve received? Probably not. Apply this same rule when using Twitter. I would recommend that you reply to the person with a thank you and move-on. However, if you feel the mention contains content your followers might want to see, just make sure your retweet includes a thank you to the user who mentioned you. Too many hashtags in a tweet is distracting and ineffective. Your tweet will come off looking spammy and consequently will be ignored. You want people to actually read what youre tweeting, right? Instead of stuffing your tweet with hashtags, pick one or two keywords that relate to your tweet and place those at the end with hashtags. I see this all the time. Businesses will tweet a question like, Hows your day going? First of all, Twitter only allows for 140 characters. How are your followers going to respond to such an open-ended question in so few characters? And, whats the point of your question? Youre allowed to be casual and conversational on Twitter, but put some thought into the questions you want to ask and how you want to ask them. First, decide whether you want to keep things professional or be personal. Then, ask the questions that align with your Twitter strategy. If youre keeping it professional, stick to questions that pertain to industry-related topics: Leaning toward personal tweets? Ask a question that invites a response: When something big is happening to your business, its expected that youll be doing some extra tweeting. You could be ramping up your Twitter activity because youre promoting an upcoming event, running a campaign, or publishing a white paper. A common mistake, however, is to be absent from Twitter 80% of the year and then only show up when you have something you need to promote. Twitter is active year-round and you should be too. Regardless of whether its a busy time of year for you or not, you can always maintain a regular stream of activity and engagement. Monitor feeds daily to participate in relevant conversations and re-share others useful content. That way, when it comes time to promote your own business, you can increase your activity and your followers will be more likely to help you spread the word. Youre busy. Your business is busy. You want to participate in social media, but you just dont have the time. Enter the tweet scheduler. Numerous services allow you to schedule tweets ahead of time. This is a feature that can be very useful. I like to schedule tweets when Im going on vacation or when there are a few things I want to make sure I promote in a timely manner. Using a too often, however, can start to make you look like a robot. Even when youre using Twitter in a professional capacity, your followers want to know there is a person behind the tweets. Schedule in moderation and inject some personality. Scheduling the same tweet for 10:01AM, 12:01PM, 2:01PM, and 4:01PM is a dead giveaway that you have relinquished your Twitter participation to a robot, and will hurt engagement. What could I possibly mean by tweet length? Were already limited enough by the 140 characters, arent we? Often, taking up the entire 140 characters limits your followers in their ability to retweet you and add a comment of their own. When possible, leave some characters unused to enable people to add their own commentary, @mentions, and hashtags when retweeting your content. There is nothing more irritating than when you see an interesting tweet, click on the link, and find youve been taken to a completely unrelated page. We all want to see high click-through rates, high engagement, and large followings, but a misleading link description will only hurt your reputation. You can be engaging without misleading your followers by composing a tweet that both attracts attention and relates to the link youre sending out. While there is no formula for Twitter success, avoiding some of these mistakes will certainly help you in your Twitter endeavors. What are some common Twitter mistakes youve seen?","If you spend any time in marketing circles or reading about marketing, you will bump into the word branding. Branding is one of those concepts that is a bit vague, at least for the non-marketer small business owner. So today were going to look at what is branding from the small business perspective. Were also going to tackle the question of whether branding should matter to small businesses  or whether its something only large corporations should or can afford to care about. There are thousands of definitions of branding or just plain old brand. One of the best definitions of brand Ive seen is . To them, a brand is what sticks in your mind associated with a product, service, or organization  whether or not, at that particular moment, you bought or did not buy. That seems a good informal way to describe a companys brand. Under that definition, many things can contribute to a brand. Does a picture pop into your mind about a company, such as its logo or colors? Think about the logo, such as Coca Cola  recognizable the world over, executed in its distinctive curvy script in white against red. And when you see it, do you imagine the effervescence of a Coke, the dark color or how it tastes? All of those things may run fleetingly through your mind when you want something to drink. Sometimes its not the logo but another visual that comes to mind  even packaging. For instance, I couldnt tell you what the Tiffany logo looks like, but the instant I see the iconic Tiffany blue box, I know which company were talking about. Certain attributes immediately come to mind, such as high quality jewelry and luxury home goods  things no one actually needs, but so many desire. Or perhaps it is the companys approach to customizing its product. Mention the name Starbucks and immediately coffee comes to mind. Now, I dont even like Starbucks coffee (too strong and burnt tasting to me) but when traveling I will always look for a Starbucks. I know I can expect a certain level of quality. The coffee will be fresh  not a stale witches brew. But its more than coffee I think of  its that I can get it the way I want it. No matter where I am, Starbuckswill have hot, steamed low-fat milk to cut the strength.I can ask for a Cafe Misto (the Starbucks name for cafe au lait) made half with steamed milk, and half with brewed coffee. And I will get it  even though its not on the menu. Why? Because Starbucks aims to give you coffee gussied up the way you want it. So when you ask the question what is branding  it is something that triggers associations in our minds. Branding is about creating an .Its what sets one company apart from another. In short, it tells us what we can expect from that company. Its about the people have of the company. Branding (a verb) is doing those activities and communications, large and small, that create and reinforce a brand, i.e., what a company is known for. Your branding (a noun) is all the elements that make up a brand, whether logo, packaging, colors, reputation for customer service, reputation for customizing customer orders without complaint, speed, self-serve options, low price, high quality  whatever. According to the Tronvig Group that I mentioned above, branding is what creates . They say it is what keeps consumers loyal and buying repeatedly. I would agree with that  but. Id go further. Branding is what helps a prospective buyer call to mind a particular company when it comes time to buy. In other words, branding also helps with . In a world of infinite choices, branding that helps people remember YOUR company is more important than ever. Today consumers have a seemingly endless choice of retailers, products and services available at their fingertips online, or at the local strip shopping centers or shopping malls. If consumers are shopping for something, what do they do? Go to Google, where billions of Web pages and yellow page listings are available. Not only are there many choices, but some of the decision factors that traditionally separated and defined companies are today transparent and without much difference. Take, for example, pricing. Pricing is easier to discover and compare than ever before. In certain industries there may be very little price difference. When all prices are the same, what makes the buyer choose one over another? Nuances and qualitative factors may make the difference. For small businesses, what sets apart the business may be factors such as high quality, craftsmanship, personalized customer service, superior knowledge to help customers make the proper product selections, and similar qualitative factors. The challenge for some small businesses is how to get customers to think of them when its time to buy. You dont want your company to be nonexistent in the customers mind. And if they see your brand name in a list of competing vendors (such as in a search engine), you want your brand to be associated with positive factors that make it stand out. Branding is not a replacement for sales or specific marketing campaigns. But branding assists and reinforces your sales and marketing efforts in important ways. Actually, you cant afford not to. Sure, branding can get incredibly expensive if your idea of branding is a nationwide television and print campaign. But it doesnt need to be. Here are 4 low-cost actions you can start on today to help your small business create, build and reinforce brand: Whats that one thing you want customers to think of, when thinking of your company? Think it through. If you or your team are confused about that one thing that sets your company apart, customers probably will be, too. If youre not sure what this is, find out. Schedule a strategy session and hash it out with your team. Do a customer survey to ask existing customers what they value most. Start asking new customers what made them choose your company or product or service. Try to limit it to one thing or at most two things you want your brand to be known for. If you end up with a laundry list of 20 things, go back to the drawing board and narrow it down. Customers dont choose a vendor for 20 reasons. Its usually one or two reasons that push them over the decision edge. This is low hanging fruit. Check over your website, your Facebook page, your brochures, your ads  every piece of marketing you have. Do you have words in them to clearly convey that one thing that you want to be known for? Or are your marketing materials sending mixed messages, with brochures emphasizing lowest cost, while your website emphasizes unparalleled quality? Maybe you deliver both, but in that case the combination of both should be conveyed, not one or the other. Is your company name abbreviated in your marketing materials with cryptic initials that customers may not understand? Just because you refer to your company internally by an abbreviated acronym doesnt mean customers have any clue what youre talking about. Look at sales scripts, too. Are sales reps conveying what your brand is, the way you want them to? Or are they saying something different? You may even learn something from them  they may have discovered through trial and error what customers value most and how customers perceive your company. Make sure everything reinforces what you want customers to think about your business. Stories make your brand stick. Its not enough just to say over and over that we offer high quality. Show it! Write up case studies about how you helped a customer with your high-quality solution to solve a problem that no one else could solve. Or get a testimonial about how your product outlasted other products by five years. Write your company story in the About section of your website, and repeat that story in press releases, interviews and other communications. Create a video about your company story. Check your marketing materials for consistency. Are you using an outdated logo on some materials? Do you even have a logo? Are colors consistent? Visual elements are important clues that trigger other associations and help customers remember your business.","Businesses often start by fulfilling a niche need and then eventually grow beyond that need to offer other products or services as they grow. Think of how Google started as a way to organize the Web with its search engine. Eventually it added mapping, Google docs and many other services. Or think about how Apple started by serving those who wanted a powerful personal computer experience. But the company would eventually create products ranging from tablets to smartphones to music players. So its unique to see a business that started in a very specific niche and stayed there successfullyfor more than 100 years. Still, thats the story of . The company runs a bike factory with about sixty employees. And they still make bikes catering largely to the same niche, merchants and industrial workers who need to transport cargo. See the video profile of the company below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khUkhzxjK_k In 1898, the company was founded by entrepreneur Morris Worksman. Worksman owned a dry goods store on Manhattans Lower East Side. He got the idea for his product by watching street merchants struggle to transport their merchandise. The solution was a bike specifically sold to vendors. The bikes are still used by everyone from hot dog vendors to pizza delivery people today. Then during World War II, Worksmans son had an epiphany. While employed as an aircraft engineer, he realized how useful the bikes would also be for transporting workers and their cargo across gigantic manufacturing plants. It was an extension of the same service the bikes had performed for street merchants transporting their wares. Today, the companys industrial tricycle, a three-wheeled vehicle with a cargo space in back, is still the main transport used by maintenance and other workers at Boeing, Ford, WalMart and General Electric. These companies remain Workmans biggest customers. Meanwhile, consumer bicycle manufacturers with much more diversified offerings like Schwinn have long since moved overseas. Worksman has stayed in the U.S., although many of the companys suppliers are now outside the country. Yet the company continues to serve the same market, co-owner Wayne Sosin . Worksman also continues to see an 8 percent growth in sales each year, despite tough times during the 2008 recession. Its not that Sosin or his partners are against innovating or moving into new markets. The company just introduced a bike for off road use and consumer model bikes priced at around $500. (Worksmans industrial models are around $1,000.) But clearly this bike maker is proof that some businesses do best when carving out a small distinct nicheand staying there.","Fox Mobile/Jamba (part of News Corp. (NYSE: NWS)) CEO Lucy Hood has resigned this morning, we have learned through sources, and now confirmed by PR. Jamba COO Lee Fenton will be the interim CEO until they find a new replacement. Updated : the company has now issued an official release , after stonewalling us for the last three hours on queries. The release says she wants to do more entrepreneurial ventures, but there has to be more than that: earlier this year she was appointed the CEO of the Jamster venture, in which News Corp. holds joint stake with Verisign. She has been with News Corp. for more than a decade, helped launch Fox Mobile Entertainment in 2005, and then this JV with Verisign. More in extended entry Staci adds : Yes, there is more to it although even this may not be all of it. According to one source familiar with the situation, the company is still very bullish on mobile but theres a sense now that the operation probably needs to be run from Europe rather than LA. Most of the staff is based in Berlin and the business/opportunity is more Europe (and Asia) for now than in the U.S.. Hood traveled a great deal but was still based in the U.S. Fenton, who was hired as COO to lead worldwide operations, has the European know-how: he was director of consumer platforms for Vodafone (NYSE: VOD) prior to joining Jamba and before that was commercial director of Vivendi (EPA: VIV)-Vodafone JV Vizzavi. Hes held a variety of senior positions at other companies and could well be the top candidate to run Jamba on a permanent basis. This source stressed that Hood is respected as an executive but her departure is likely to fuel some critics who didnt see her as the right candidate to head the 600-plus employee JV, which was far bigger than Fox Mobile. Update : Some more details: Fenton is assuming Hoods responsibilities but technically wont be known as interim or acting CEO. I am told by another source in a position to know that he is a serious contender for the CEO job but there will be a search . Fenton was supposed to be LA-based when he was hired but that shifted. Its uncertain now whether he will be based in Europe or U.S. during this transition. The structure going forward has yet to be determined. As this source put it, there probably will be some fallout; I don","Bill Gross is the founder of idealab, where he founded some 100 companies in past 20 years. In the video he explains the reason behind the success and failure of a startup. What matters the most for a startup to work? Is it the idea? Business model? funding? team? Or timing? He found one factor that matters the most and the result was even surprising to him. He explains how and what makes company a success with some great examples like AirBnB, Youtube, Z.com and Uber.

Time is difficult to quantify and track, and as such, many small business owners mistakenly treat time as if it were a limitless resource. However, this couldnt be further from the truth. found that only 9% of executives were very satisfied with how employees time was currently allocated. In addition, almost half of executives said that their current time allocation didnt align with the companys objectives. And the average office worker can tell you that far too much company time is spent on trivial tasks, such as responding to emails and attending non-essential meetings. Effective time management is critical to the productivity and profitability of your business. So, how can businesses improve time management? It isnt as easy as just telling employees to use their time more effectively. Instead, the leadership team needs to build a corporate culture that actively supports effective time management across the whole organization. Multitasking is a major buzzword in the business world. Employees are expected to be able to effectively juggle multiple tasks at once. So managers fill their work hours with various projects, meetings and corporate activities. However, studies are increasingly proving that multitasking is ineffective. In fact, Stanford researchers proved that , are easily distracted and often lack focus. If multitasking isnt the key to effective time management, then what is? The answer is flow. As defined by author and psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, on the task at hand. It is often referred to as being in the zone, and employees are far more productive while in this state than at any other time. To improve productivity, employers should do everything they can to keep employees in flow mode. This means fostering a corporate environment of silence and privacy. Whenever possible, managers should avoid burdening their employees with multiple tasks or distracting them with unnecessary emails and phone calls. Many employees also benefit from having private offices, rather than working in noisy cubicle farms. One of the biggest scourges to effective time management is the corporate meeting. The average meeting takes up valuable time and interrupts the employee flow-mode, while generating very little in the way of meaningful results. According to a , ineffective meetings are among the top time wasters in the average work week. Additionally, employees spend almost six hours each week in meetings, and 69% of employees feel like these meetings are unproductive. To better manage company time, executives should only schedule meetings that are absolutely necessary. Meetings should have a specific purpose: To make a decision or solve a problem. There should be a detailed agenda of issues to be discussed and in what order, and the amount of time allotted to each. If a meeting is only designed to impart information, consider sending out an email instead. Many meetings can also be made optional, so if an employee is in that critical flow mode, he or she can opt out of the interruption. Every executive knows that in order for a company to move forward, there needs to be a clearly defined set of objectives and goals for the future. However, just laying out these objectives isnt enough. Too often, executives and their employees become mired in day-to-day tasks and never find the time to advance long-term goals. This is where integrated, electronic time tracking comes in. Effective electronic time tracking systems should capture costs as well as the time spent for each individual employee and project, and then integrate this information into a comprehensive view of company time allocation. In this way, you can determine whether your companys current time allocation aligns with your company objectives. As with any resource, correctly allocating time will reduce waste and facilitate company growth. Peter Druckers, the legendary management consultant, once said: In the business world, time is precious. It is in every employers best interest to promote a corporate culture that measures, manages and values it.","London-based mobile software development firm Golden Gecko has received an undisclosed amount of first round funding from Barcelona-based VC firm Active Capital Partners.

But unlike many, Pratik Doshi saw the opportunity to build an entire business on it. For someone who has generated a revenue of more than Rs. 30 lakhs(USD 50,000) in a couple of months by selling umbrellas, Pratik welcomes and embraces the rains with an unparalleled enthusiasm. Pratik has been through the roller-coaster ride of entrepreneurship with an extra bumpy bootstrapping experience. spoke to Pratik to find out his secret to success and future plans with Cheeky Chunk, the brand under which he sells his umbrellas. Pratik started Cheeky Chunk in 2014 when he marketed a few umbrellas in a small market. Due to the great response, he decided to start a company selling unique designer umbrellas at affordable prices and opted out of a job after his post -graduation. He says, Pratik recalls friends laughing at him behind his back and ridiculing the idea since none of them thought of selling umbrellas for a living. While all his MBA friends enjoyed fat paychecks at a desk job with little worries, Pratik was hustling throughout the city with nothing but a minimal capital and a bright idea that needed execution. He managed to get 500 umbrellas manufactured and sold via friends and family. Pratik invested his savings of Rs. 1,35,000 which he earned by tutoring in his college days, forvalidating the idea. This money was spent on designing, manufacturing his product and developing the website. The idea was validated, but he hardly earned any money. Pratik recalls, What a regular MBA would earn in two years, Pratik earns that much working just for a quarter of the year onlyfrom sellingumbrellas.  The handle, the panels, the cloth, the frame, the print, the stitching  everything needs to be perfectly executed in order to make the perfect umbrella. For manufacturing the umbrellas, Pratik sources the frames from Rajasthan, cloth from local domestic suppliers and has contractors for printing and stitching. Pratik says, As the number of orders surged to up to 400 per day, it became increasingly difficult for the small team to pack each order individually, cross-check the product, generate invoices and take care of other menial jobs. Pratik says, Pratik believes that students are generally very sheltered and made to study pie-charts and excel sheets while the real learning lies on ground. He says, The seven-member team of Cheeky Chunk comprises of two MBA interns, an accountant and two dedicated resources to check and pack the umbrellas. Since each umbrella is water-tested and checked for defects, the rate of returns is quite low. According to Pratik, photography has played a key role in Cheeky Chunks marketing so far. He believes that 50 per cent of marketing is done by the product and the customer. Another smart tactic is to gift your product to people who are connected to your target audience. However, Pratik advises against paying anyone to write about your product as the reviews are more impactful when they are recommendations as well. Pratik also emphasises on marketing on e-commerce platforms. He says, Pratik suggests in never telling your customer to buy your product. Instead, focus on just displaying the best product and making people love the situation where your product fits in. Cheeky Chunk focused on making people love rain and tried to invoke special memories related o rains. Currently Cheeky Chunk is selling through their , Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdealand a few retail stores in Mumbai (in Bandra, Matunga, Breach Candy and Churchgate). Majority of the sales is coming from e-commerce marketplaces. They have already sold more than 7000 umbrellas, much more than the initial target 1000 set early this year. The contribution of tier-2 and tier-3 cities has been almost 40 per cent including those from Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Many of these comprise of the resellers who would buy in bulk from the marketplaces. Pratik is expecting the sales to touch 10,000 umbrellas by the end of season. Companys profit margin is sustainable at the moment. Initially, it managed the working capital for umbrellas by giving suppliers a token amount and convincing them to give a credit period till they start selling the products.  Cheeky Chunk is focusing on one step at a time. They have prototyped a few products in the off season last year which will be launched by Diwali this year. Pratik understands that scaling in this industry requires the expansion of products lineup. He will be looking to get investors who like the work at Cheeky Chunk and connect to the team. He says, Hes looking to hire, expand, mature and be a purple cow in a field full of white ones. A confident Pratik signs off with the following vision:","The weather is finally warm enough to where Ive created my outdoor patio space. And that means that its summer reading time!

One report suggests that the new 12-inch device could be ready by March 2015. Blogger and noted Apple leaker Jack March that the new laptop from Apple will be fanless. This would allow the new device to be considerably thinner and lighter than the current MacBook Air. Intels Broadwell processor is expected to be used in the new laptop, as well, to keep the devices temperature low. Also thinner on the purported MacBook Air are the bezels around the display. This means that the new laptop will more closely resemble the MacBook Pro with Retina Display. The current MacBook Air model is just more than a half-inch thick when closed and weighs a little more than 2 pounds. But, based on these reports, the newer model could be much more slender with considerably less bulk. In addition to its slimmed down and lighter weight body, March also suggests there will be no extra room on the side of the keyboard. Essentially, this means almost every inch of the anticipated devices control surface will be dedicated to functionality. The MacBook Air will also likely feature the new USB Type C port. Its uncertain if Apple will include any cables to connect older devices with older USB connections, or if theyll include it with an accessories package of some kind. In a more recent Tweet, March dispels another rumor on the new Apple laptop: The last MacBook Air device was released back in 2013. Soon after it hit the market, however, a lot of users . This was especially troubling because the laptop was billed as a mobile productivity tool. There are no early indications on the expected cost of the new MacBook Air when its released. The current model is for $899 through the Apple Store.","Ive reviewed books written by one author, but rarely have I come across a good compilation of business experts in one text. Leave it to business intelligence to yield a solid compilation such as Edited by analytics expert Thomas Davenport, the book gives an overview of business intelligence that can make or break strategic big data development. This past summer I picked up a free copy from the Chicago stop of a SAS road show for its new data virtualization solution. Because of the different authors involved, I will highlight the sections that I feel are worth a read. The first chapters outlay analytics in its various forms. Davenport begins chapter one explaining the various forms of analytics and their differences, while chapter two, by Keri Pearson, provides a financial example of ROI. A list that appears at the end of the chapter has some great lessons learned that consider an order of potential occurrence. Such an approach can help organization frame which project to address. To show what I mean, heres an example of selecting the projects with the largest ROI (return on investment): The most relatable chapter for small businesses is Chapter 4. The author, Bill Franks, gives a good foundation of how Web data is the basis for doing more than accounting Web traffic. He offers a refreshed look at the worth of non-conversion traffic  the 96% of website visitors that do not click an intended button or submit a fill-out form. This segment is worthwhile for small businesses seeking a deeper reasoning behind the cost to modify an analytics solution or create a custom dashboard. Many still treat analytics as a form of accounting. As they say in commercials Wait, theres more! Well, Franks explains the more with the chapter segment, Web Data In Action. He mentions a few models such as attrition and response modeling. I liked how imaginative Franks take is for emphasizing the customer segments that businesses can develop, such as this comment: Another solid segment is Chapter 12 Engaging Analytical Talent. This was written by Jeanne Harris (who co-wrote with Davenport and Robert Morison) and Elizabeth Craig. It gives a brief overview of how to set assignment objectives that shows your organization understands analytical talent: The ideas were spot on to whats happening. I recalled a well-known recruitment firms study that indicated analysts changing jobs partly from lack of engagement and meaningful support. Moreover, Harris and Craig show how to identify 4 Breeds of analytical talent that deftly conveys the value of each talent. Privacy issues are noted in Chapter 4, but advocates should read Chapter 13, Governance for Analytics. Stacy Blanchard and Robert Morson lay out the process for establishing analytic management, the processes that ultimately protect data as much as it extracts value: Concepts, while meant for large organizations, can still fit a medium sized business, such as guiding principles and understanding why governance is important. The list You Know Youre Succeeding When can be modified for smaller businesses that uses analytics and have stakeholders remote from their operations. Later chapters present cases of large enterprises. A few note the impact of analytics on specific industries, such as retail (Sears) and pharmaceutical (Merck). Again, this is a book meant for managers of large organizations. But for small businesses looking to grow, it can give an overview that encourages a deeper appreciation for detailed books like or . Analytics, in general, forces a business to look critically at how it operates. Books like this one will provide the right framework for managing those operations for your best business performance.","* * * * * In some sense it is a natural progression. What I have been doing with my PhD career is using mathematics and statics to model how the brain works, and right now I am using the same type of mathematics and statistics to model how a social system works. There are a lot of similarities because a social system is essentially a group of people connected by conversation, communication and interaction. A neurosystem is a group of neurons connected by synapses. My high-level definition is that influence is the ability to change someones thought or actions. You either change someones sentiment or opinion or feelings about something, or you change their actions. A purchase, the referral of a friend, staying loyal  all of these are behavior changes. It matters how you do it too, because you cant do it by force. You cant do it by trickery or frustration. You are not influencing them then. The target should be fully aware and willing to change their action or their mind. Thats influence at a high level. How is this important to business? The easiest way to explain it is to think of the purchase funnel. Most people in business know this concept. The levels of the funnel are AIDA  Awareness, Interest, Desire and Action. Action is the final level. Anytime you move someone from being unaware of your product into awareness, you change their mind. If you move them from awareness to being interested in your product, you change their mind. As you move along the top three layers of the purchase funnel, you are changing their minduntil the last level, when you change their action also. At Lithium Technologies, we have about 10 years of data from over 200 communities. We have been able to quantify the effects of influencers as opposed to some random person in the community. Typically, people start trying to trigger some message from some seed  we call it the seeding population. Choosing the seeding population is very important because if you choose a random user versus an influencer as a seeding population, the result is quite different. If you seed your word-of-mouth with influencers, you gain almost 50 percent [better results]. Most people are concerned with influencers only. But in reality, influence involves two parties: the influencer and the target. You cant find the influencer without considering the target, because what the target wants influences what type of influencer you need to find. We found six different factors that affect how influence propagates from the influencer to the target. The first one is . Domain credibility means the influencer has a specific expertise or knowledge in a certain domain. There is no such thing as universal influencers. The second factor is . Bandwidth is the influencers ability to transmit expertise in a particular social media channel. [It includes factors such as] the number of followers, the number of time they tweet a day or how frequently they post a blog. Those are all tangible, measurable things. Next, the you share has to be relevant to a target. If the target wants to buy a camera and the influencer is an expert in gardening, thats not going to work. One factor most people overlook is . Peoples interests and credibility change over time. A camera expert this year may become a sports car expert next year. Next comes . That means where your influencer is, and where your targets are, had better be in the same place. If your target is a certain age group and they use Twitter, then its useless to find an influencer on LinkedIn or on YouTube. The same thing goes for [geographical] location. If your target [customer is] in New York, its useless to find an influencer in L.A. Finally, the last factor is target confidence, or . Whether the influencer has credibility, bandwidth or relevance doesnt matter if the target doesnt trust him or her. To propagate influence, you need all six of these factors. In a community where you have a group of like-minded people, influencers arise naturally. How do you reward those influencers so they will work with you to co-create value for everyone? The traditional belief is you dont give them money because money corrupts everything. There is some truth to that. People who are there to help, if you pay them, may feel that the little money you pay is not worth their time. And people who want money [to help] are not [truly] there to help, which creates a negative user experience and usually leads to the downfall of the community. But financial motives arent always bad. We have a case study, , which is a U.K. based mobile network. They advertise themselves as a business run by you, so they keep their overhead really low. The community helps them provide customer service, marketing and even R&D. They reward the member two ways. One is the kudos, a token of appreciation, but they also give them free minutes off of their monthly bill. That is a financial reward and seems to work. It turns out the main difference is whether the reward is transferable or non-transferable. Money is transferable, but the free minutes are only applicable to the member. The fact that the reward is non-transferable means its unique and special. That is what makes this type of reward work. I have a .","Is your business metabolism a little low or sluggish?It takes a lot of energy to keep up.

Social media leader Facebook has begun selling ads and sponsored posts. This means its much harder to reach your customers without paying extra. Even though Twitter has only begun to sell advertising, increasing traffic and noise on the site has made it tougher to focus your message and get it heard. Enter , a mobile messaging app that is growing in popularity and may offer an alternative to both. Download WhatsApp to your smartphone and you can message any other connection thats using the service.You can invite other business contacts to join you on WhatsApp by sending out invitations to your Facebook, Gmail and other connections. You can also take advantage of social features like group chat that create a similar experience to the way users communicate on Facebook or Twitter. WhatsApp does all this without charging monthly text messaging fees like your mobile carrier. The service also doesnt sell or display ads and developers say they have no plans to start. Instead, iPhone users are charged a one-time installation fee of $.99 to download the app. Users on other operating systems including Android, BlackBerry and Windows get a one year download free with a $.99 per year charge after that for the service. WhatsApp is more than a potential business tool. Its also an interesting business model. founders Brian Acton and Jan Koum, both former Yahoo! engineers, have already made millions on their app despite the low annual fee for most users and a refusal to sell advertising. How? Well, the company last week, it now has an estimated 250 million monthly active users.That number may put it ahead of Twitter which announced passing 200 million active monthly users in December. It may also mean the service is gaining on Skype which owner Microsoft claimed had reached 280 million users in October. At $.99 per active user per year, its not hard to see how WhatsApp has raked in the profits in the four years since it was founded.","How do you know that youre making the right move? As a small business owner youre always evaluating and deciding, watching and then doing, discovering and then digging in. Youre a shopper. Every piece of software, office equipment and service that you purchase for your business is a shopping experience: You have a certain type of shoppers behavior  the same is true for your potential clients. The question is: What are their shopping habits and how can you become a more integral part of it? When making the most of your clients shopping experience here are two new behaviors to consider. As long as the mobile internet connection is strong, then its nothing to whip out that smart phone and run a quick online search for the item youre interested in. I do it often, especially when Im out with family, clients, or friends (thats just about everybody). While they talk to the sales associate, I search and discover other locations and prices for the same item. Of course, price isnt the only factor (and often times its not even the primary one) in a purchase (customer experience goes a long way). But heres the deal: as we put our cell phones to greater use, your mobile web presence becomes more important to your business. Can shoppers discover the right kind of information about you on the spot (i.e. location, reviews, price range, hours of operation)? Do you have a web presence and is it mobile friendly? In   Susan Payton laments about our inability (in the U.S.) to use our phones to pay for things. Since mobile spending is fun when you can find the right app, I understand her complaint (and Im excited about her prediction that there will be more effective apps in 2012). One of my favorites, so far, is the Starbucks app (new to me). It tracks your gift card money, so no matter how many cards you receive for your birthday theyre all logged into the same place (once you set it up). It also tracks your purchases (as long as you use the app or the gift card to pay). It gives you points and rewards (like free soy milk, free refills on certain drinks) thatll keep you coming back for more. Its a smart and fun little app. I like it so much that I found myself at the grocery story trying to pay with my cell phone (didnt work). Its true that everybody doesnt have or even like Androids, iPhones and Blackberries  I know some people who still prefer a simple flip phone. So before you go out and spend money on designing an app for your company, check your market. If they are heavy smartphone users, then its time to set up that mobile friendly website and start brainstorming about that app; of course, it has to smart, easy to use and fun or itll just get lost somewhere on your phone (you know that place where glitchy apps go to die). Internet connections for cell phones are stronger. Shoppers are mobile and more tech savvy. Is your web presence in front of this trend? Behind it? Or Missing in action?","Youre already a customer of this type of franchise business.That means you know itfrom a customer perspective.Youve also probably heard thats its a tough business.And, youd be right. Almost 50% of the people that contact me are interested in buying one.Hands-down, its the most popular sector in . Its also very visible. If you guessed that Im referring to food servicemostly restaurants of the (quick service restaurant) variety, youre right. Before I get into why the food-service business is the toughest around, I want to share some industry data and trends: If youre seriously considering becoming the owner of a fast food franchise, you need to make sure that you know exactly what your role is going to be as the franchisee. For example, if you wanted to own a McDonalds franchise in your area, not only would you have to have deep pockets; youd also have to be prepared to be an owner-operator. In other words, if you have visions of opening up a McDonalds restaurant and managing it from afar, you had better adjust your lenses. Thats because McDonalds expects you to be there. They also have a , and its not one of those 2-week ones. Another thing thats worth asking (yourself) is what type of lifestyle it is that you want to have as an owner. For example, are you looking for a franchise opportunity that will allow you to have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the hours youll be working? If so, the food-service business may not be right for you. In most cases . In other words, youll be there a lot. And, while youre thereworking in your food service franchise, youre going to have to be a Jack or Jill of all trades. Youll need to be flexible. If an employee doesnt show up for work, you may have to drop what youre doing and fill-in yourself. I was in food-service and employee no-shows are very common. In a nutshell, its the absolute lack of control that makes owning a QSRor any food-service establishment, very challenging. Now, I dont want you to feel that Im trying to deter you from going after your dream. If youve always wanted to own a restaurant by all means investigate the opportunities that exist today. Just know that: can be as much as 50% annually. So, be prepared to go through a lot of employees. They vary tremendously. A lot of things can affect your food costs. Things like fuel prices (which affect delivery costs), natural disasters (which can wipe out crops) and other assorted maladies can and do affect food costs  food costs. Translation: your profit margins can drop quickly. In my experience, this tends to happen on your businesses busiest days and times. For example, if you own a full service restaurant and the dishwasher breaks, plan on experiencing one of the grossest jobs imaginable in food service; washing dirty dishes by hand. If you dont have clean dishes available, you cant serve your food. On a positive note, a series of lousy reviews can help you figure out whats wrong quickly so you can address it. And, if you cant your franchisor can. Of course great reviews are just that; great. It was true for me during the many years that I was in the food business. Of course theres nothing wrong with hard work, but talking about having to work really hard and doing it 15 hours a day, 7 days a week, are two vastly different things. If you want to become the owner of a food franchise, start your search for the right one with your eyes wide-open. There are great opportunities in food service these days. You should be able to find one that suits you. Just talk to a lot of existing franchisees before you become one yourself. That way, youll know what to expect as an owner.","The U.S. Senate is expected to vote this week on an Internet sales tax. The proposed law aims to give states the power to require out-of-state sellers to collect sales tax for online sales. If you think this issue sounds familiar, youd be right. Its legislation that has been kicked around for some time now. In 2012, a similar bill was considered but expired without being acted upon. And now its back. The Senate determined earlier this week to take up debate on the legislation and may , the New York Times reports. If it passes through the Senate, it will then move to the U.S. House of Representatives. The Marketplace Fairness Act wants to undo a decades old Supreme court decision applying interstate commerce law.In Quill Corp v. North Dakota, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that retailers need only collect sales tax for states where they have a physical presence. However, consumers are still required to pay sales tax on their purchases. The issue then, is whether businesses are required to collect and remit sales taxes not whether consumers must pay it. Thats where small businesses become concerned. Advocates for brick and mortar businesses say the Marketplace Fairness Act works to level the proverbial playing field by forcing online retailers to collect the same sales taxes as any other retailer. Opponents point to the regulatory nightmare faced by small online retailers who may now be forced to contend with a bewildering morass of local tax laws. Weve been reporting on the and pointing out . There are 9,600 state and local tax jurisdictions that online businesses that sell online would be required to comply with. (R-N.H.): in The Daily Beast, adding regulation burdens small businesses: The bill is being considered as a more comprehensive solution after six states attempted to deal with the issue through passage of so-called   also known as the Amazon tax. Those states include Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, North Carolina and Vermont. Similar laws are being proposed or considered in eight other states too. But those involved in affiliate marketing welcome the passage of an Internet sales tax. The affiliate marketing industry has been adversely affected by states attempts to deal with the tax issue. Should the Marketplace Fairness Act, finally, pass it will eliminate the notion of (and need for) the affiliate nexus tax altogether by leveling the playing field not only between brick and mortar stores and online businesses (when catering to residents of the same state), but also between online businesses regardless of whether they drive sales through affiliates or not, said affiliate marketing advocate in a recent email interview. Prussakov says affiliate nexus tax laws already ratified in the above states have caused advertisers to terminate affiliates residing in these states from their affiliate programs altogether. Prussakov says 76,000 affiliates have been affected overall by the laws. Those businesses either shut down or crossed state lines to continue as active affiliates. He says it is the official position of the affiliate marketing industry that only a federal solution can put an end to the snowballing effects of state affiliate nexus taxes. One major marketplace for small online sellers is firmly against the proposed Marketplace Fairness Act. Ebay.com President John Donahoe recently wrote in an open letter that the bill will who will now be saddled with these taxes, hurting their ability to grow their businesses. Make no mistake, he writes, the current bills penalize small online businesses. Those fighting for this change refuse to acknowledge that the burden on businesses like yours is far greater than for a big national retailer. It may harm your ability to grow, and costs jobs, including yours. Donahoe says small online businesses with less than 50 employees and those making less than $10 million in out-of-state sales should be exempt from the proposed legislation, if passed.","When Jack Halpern started working in a nursing home at age 24, he quickly formed friendships with many of the residents. And although the nursing home where he worked was great by industry standards, many of the residents werent cared for in the way they really wanted. It was then that he realized that his calling was to improve the lives of elderly people. And was formed.

Because of this, it offers a variety of services to fit the needs of families trying to do whats best for their family members. Halpern says: from on . Thanks to some unlikely friendships. When Halpern started working at a nursing home, he made friends with many of the residents. One particular resident, Sam, helped him understand what people were looking for in their own care. As he rose through the ranks, Halpern became disillusioned with the whole elder care system, seeing how many in the industry were more concerned with profits than families. So he left to pursue a career in finance. But he never forgot about Sam or the other residents. Then one day it all came together. Halpern explains: Successfully helping an early client. One of My Elder Advocates first clients was a man who had been a political leader and prominent attorney in his earlier years. But he was being taken advantage of by a senior home care company. So My Elder Advocate helped the man and his family find an assisted living home. And later on they even protected him during his hospital stays and helped him move into an apartment and find a trusted home care aide. By helping him in all those different ways, the company helped make the mans last few years as comfortable as possible. And it helped Halpern and his team realize that they could really help people with their offerings. He says: Franchising can lead to the fastest business growth. The company started its franchise program this year, about seven years after its initial launch. Looking back, Halpern says he should have launched the program earlier to facilitate more growth. Use proven approaches, but provide individualized care. Those two philosophies might sound contradictory, but My Elder Advocate has found a way to balance the two methods. Halpern explains: Old Man by Neil Young. Halpern explains: Lifes most persistent and urgent question is, What are you doing for others?

For example, Ill often advise using words people naturally search for or terms important to your site when talking about or . However, picking keywords can be a bit tricky. And if youre not going after the right ones, then it really doesnt matter how well you do incorporating them into your site. Because you wont be bringing attracting the right people. And thats what keywords are all about.  Its about picking the terms that people are looking for when trying to find companies just like yours. You want to rank for the terms and phrases that are most likely to convert. With that in mind, here are some tips for picking good keywords. Your first step into keyword research should be to make a list of all the terms someone would use to find you. Rack your own brain before you go anywhere else. How would you search for what you do? What terms naturally come to mind? Dont go for the big dollar terms like flower or dog. Theyll be very difficult to rank for and wont covert very well anyway because theyre too generic.  Think of both broad and targeted terms. Informational and buying-focused. Get a good mix. Then move one. Once you have your initial list, trying using keyword research tools to help you narrow it down.  Tools give you the chance to test drive certain terms before you invest in them.  By entering a phrase into Googles keyword tool, youll get valuable insight into the competition for that term, its monthly search traffic (local and global) and related terms that you perhaps hadnt thought of. For example, though youd never want to try and rank for [shoe], by entering it into a tool like Wordtracker, you may find promising long tail keywords like [athletic shoes], [converse shoes] or [wholesale shoes].  Make note of how many people are competing for these terms (the competition for advertising is a fairly good metric). This number will tell you how hard it will be to steal rankings for that term. Below is a list of good keyword research tools to help you get started. (You may also want to try non conventional tools like , which does an excellent job helping you identify related terms.) You may also be able to uncover some hidden keyword gems by digging around your own site.  For example, check what phrases users are typing into your site search, what queries theyre using to find you, where theyre abandoning.  Use your analytics to collect information about how users are searching and then make changes to your site, as needed. Often, theyre telling you exactly what terms you should be ranking for, you just need to be paying attention to notice.  If youre that local shoe retailer and enough people type in a specific model of shoe, that may be a sign that you should be focusing on that brand more than you are. Sometimes its hard to identify what terms a normal searcher would use to find our site because were not normal when it comes to our topic.  Youre an expert in what you do. The person looking for you isnt. So it makes sense that theyd use different types of terms to find you.  Try asking friends, colleagues, family members or even past customers for help. Who else can you ask for keyword help? Google!  Ever perform a really broad search in Google [flowers, pets, cars, etc] and notice the Related Searches Google populates at the bottom of the page?  Theyre giving you valuable information about how users search, how terms are clumped together, and what phrases are most popular. You can also ask your competitors by taking a sneak peak at their Meta Keyword tag.  What terms are they going after that you forgot? Does their list help jog your memory about another area you can explore? Is it spying? Eh, maybe. But its all lying right there on the Internet.  Keyword research is the backbone of any business dip into search engine optimization. Its about identifying the terms people are looking for to find your kind of business or service. Once you know your keywords, you want to find ways to naturally incorporate them into your Web site.  Some common places may be in your Title tag, in the alt attributes use for images, anchor text, headings, page names, etc.  Good luck!","Business owners know the importance of maintaining good customer relations. Thats why when businesses intentionally upset their customer base, its time to take a closer look at the dynamics involved.Google created its own controversy this past Sunday  Easter Sunday  by honoring Mexican-American labor icon Cesar Chavez in the Google Easter doodle. A Google doodle is when Google temporarily replaces its logo with symbols to reflect a holiday or something else of note that occurred on that date. Normally, Googles doodles that are featured on the search engines homepage do not cause such a stir, but the decision to honor Chavez instead of the holiday has some users expressing their outrage, short-lived or not. In the doodle, the second O in Google is replaced with a cutout of the late labor leaders profile (see image above of the screenshot of Google.coms home page on Easter Sunday). Google chose March 31 as the appropriate time to honor Chavez, the co-founder of the National Farm Workers Association, now known as the United Farm Workers Union. The decision has enraged some Christians and others who feel Google ignored the holiday, but has some celebrating the honor bestowed upon Chavez. March 31 was declared Cesar Chavez Day by President Barack Obama back in 2011. The United Farm Workers Union is clearly pleased with the decision to honor Chavez: Others not so much: Others seemed confused over which Chavez Google was honoring. Buzzfeed.com found 15 people (and there are plenty more) who thought Google was honoring the late Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, with its doodle. Meanwhile, Googles closest rival, Bing, chose a much more traditional route, selecting a background of painted Easter eggs over a labor and civil rights leader for its landing page on Easter Day. Some believe Googles actions say much about its position in its industry. In a post for , the online publications business and economic correspondentMatthew Yglesias wrote: Perhaps it was just attention that Google was seeking with the doodle and the company doesnt believe that its fleeting drawing will impact its business, but is it ever a good idea to take your customers sentiments for granted? On the other hand, others have suggested Google may simply have a firmer grasp on the changing demographics of its customer base, the reason for its continued dominance in the market place. It is telling that California, Texas and Colorado each officially celebrated Cesar Chavez day yesterday. NBCs wrote on Easter that Googles decision should be seen as an acknowledgment of that change. Whatever you believe about the demographics, its clear that successful businesses must know their customers in order to survive. Thumbing your nose at them is not the best approach.","Youll get the chance to provide your expertise to reporters, bloggers, and radio show hosts who are looking for experts.

Everything appears rosy when you are in love, you want to spend the entire time with that special someone and tell him/her how much they mean to you.  In love, all that matters is the feel that two people develop over a period of time in a relationship . But wait, are you sure you have fallen in love with someone and it is not mere attraction.  There is a thin line between lust and love but the difference is vast. People do fall in love at first sight, but there are people who feel sexually attracted at first sight too. When the latter happens, people often mistake it to be love.  Drawn to someone based solely on physical and sexual arousal or attraction, that is lust. When you feel for someone physically, you don't see them for who they are, and you see them as you want them to be.  On the contrary, in love you accept the other person as they are and build a relationship on trust and mutual interest.  Relationship expert Terri Orbuch, in one of her Ted Talks, said in lust, you ignore the dumbest attitude of your partner, which weans off after a period of time when you open your eyes and see the truth. Love is not blind, it is lust that makes it blind.  When you are in a romantic relationship, there are four ways to tell whether it is love or lust. Here are four things from which you can get clear about your feelings for someone. This will definitely save you from future heartbreaks.

The company says it decided to simplify its advertising offerings because of customer preference. In her post, Simo wrote: Though Facebook was not specific about all the advertising products likely to be eliminated, Simo did mention some that would be disappearing. And some sponsored posts associated with Facebook business pages will be affected. One of the sponsored products scheduled to disappear is a feature called Questions. The special post offers a multiple choice question about a product or service users can respond to if they wish. But in the post, Simo said business customers would prefer to just add a question in a post and get a response in the comment section. Another kind of sponsored post set to disappear is the Offer, wrote Simo. The Offer post includes a simple product description and get offer button, allowing visitors to take advantage. Again, Simo said advertisers felt using an ad explaining the offer with a link to the company Web page was simpler and more effective. Another type of ad post that will not so much be eliminated as consolidated is the sponsored story post. Up until now, Facebook advertisers have had to buy a separate product for the best social context on their sponsored posts. Often this includes information on friends or fans who have liked or commented on a sponsored post. The added product is called sponsored story and is a separate purchase in addition to the post. From now on, however, Simo says Facebook will be eliminating the extra steps and adding social context with each ad purchased. Its unclear from Facebook at this time whether this means advertisers will be paying less for the additional social context in their ads or whether the cost of a sponsored ad will simply be part of the new advertising package. However, Simo claims data from sources like Nielsen and comScore show social context increases return on advertising and brand awareness. Changes are expected to make ads more consistent in appearance and to make the advertising process on Facebook simpler by reducing the number of potential ad formats. Below is Facebooks vision of a more consistent ad format. Most of these changes will begin in July, Simo wrote. She was less specific about what other changes the company might be making in its advertising products and services or what cost changes, if any, might be associated with the consolidation. Reaction from the Facebook marketing community has been fairly calm. Its going to be OK, dont panic, , Director of Marketing for Nanigans, on the company blog last week. Nanigans is a social marketing agency specializing in helping clients with Facebook advertising. Yes, Sponsored Stories have been a part of our lives as marketers for quite some time now, Cutts added. As weve come to learn, though, social ad units, especially on Facebook, have a shelf life. For Sponsored Stories that time has come. What do you think? Will these changes improve your efforts to market to customers on Facebook, make them more difficult, or have little or no effect?","Many questions invariably arise throughout the process of incorporating or forming an LLC for your business. By far, one of the most common questions is ? And more often than not, the question is framed as, These two states are hot choices for incorporation, and for good reason. Many larger corporations choose Delaware because it offers some of the most developed, flexible and pro-business statutes in the country. And Nevada is increasingly becoming a popular choice for businesses due to its low filing fees, as well as the lack of state corporate income, franchise and personal income taxes. However, as a general rule of thumb, if your corporation or LLC will have fewer than five shareholders or members (a condition which applies to the bulk of small businesses), its best to incorporate or form an LLC in the state where your business has a physical presence. This means the state where your business is physically located, where any property owned is located, where your employees reside and where the shareholders reside. Heres one example that highlights the situation. Suppose Susan owns a soap-making business in Maryland and is considering incorporating in Delaware. However, what Susan doesnt realize is that Maryland has rather strong rules pertaining to bank accounts. As an out of state business, she would need to get permission in order to open a business bank account in Maryland (even though she lives right down the road from the bank). And opening a bank account in Delaware wont be so easy, either, without any kind of physical address in the state. Thats just one particular (albeit very common) logistical challenge. There are countless other potential hurdles, not to mention added fees. For example, when a business incorporates Out of State (for instance, in Delaware), there may be additional filings and fees in both the state of incorporation as well as the state where the entrepreneur lives and runs the business. These can include: I cant overemphasize that last point, as it is a common misconception among many small business owners that I talk to. When youre just starting out, the tax burden can seem overwhelming. Its only natural to be concerned about your taxes, and certainly those tax laws in Nevada are incredibly appealing. However, just because you incorporate your business in Nevada does not mean those are the only state tax laws that apply to your business. While Nevada may not charge state income taxes for your corporation, the state where your business is physically located will come after you for those taxes sooner or later. Adding insult to injury, your tax liability may actually increase because youre viewed as a foreign entity operating in the state. Pretty soon, any benefits from incorporating in Delaware or Nevada are diluted when you add in all the extra fees and paperwork of operating out of state. Dont fall prey to the hype over these business-friendly states. The benefits are really limited to larger businesses (ones with more than five shareholders). As a small business owner, youre already contending with enough paperwork and fees as it is. Dont add more to your workload by trying to operate out of state. In this case, the simplest route of incorporating in your home state turns out to be best.","LG has unveiled at CES 2015. This curiously curved smartphone with its bending properties is already known for its design. (LG is calling it the companys bendiest phone, yet.) But, the company claims the phones main selling point is its durability. Specifically, LG is insisting its new device, in addition to its other improved features, has a tougher skin and tougher display than previous models. Like its predecessor, the G Flex 2, has a scratch resistant, self-healing back. However LG boasts this new model has taken the previous healing time from a matter of minutes to just 10 seconds. The screen has also been toughened up, the company claims. LG says the new glass screen is up to 20 percent stronger. And the enhanced 5.5 inch display has other upgrades as well. It is now fully HD with a 1080p resolution. Other upgrades include Android 5.0 OS, a Laser Auto Focus camera, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chip. So far there has been no price or release date announced.","How do you express your sense of humor without going overboard, off the edge, or over the top? Its sometimes really hard to do, but it can work wonders for building likeability and memorability at networking events, conferences and meetings. We have all been around people at events who tell inappropriate jokes, or say inappropriate things to people they dont really know thinking they are funny, connecting or trying to establish commonality. Using humor is a greatway to be remembered and stand out, but not for the wrong reasons. If we have one chance to make a first impression, then making sure your humor is appropriate for the event and the people you are with is important. I remember a particular new client of mine during my broadcast radio career, who I liked very much who would tell me ethnic jokes that he thought connected us. They used to make me very uncomfortable. I wasnt sure how to tell him until one day I just said, I really like you and appreciate our business relationship, but I would prefer not hearing ethnic jokes anymore. He simply said no problem and apologized if it offended me. There are interactions in person and online where a fun and humorous roll and flow just happens. No forcing it, no awkwardness. Its natural between some people and not others and its in bounds. When you think about the people you meet that you have that kind of chemistry or interaction with you remember them and smile. So whats funny in general, thats not controversial? When it comes to jokes and a good sense of humor in business, the no religion, no politics, no sexuality is still a best practice. Think about your real life and personal experiences that happen to all of us everyday. They are the human things that bond any of us, no matter what background we come from. We relate to each other because of them and laughing about them together is fun. These, by the way, are all things that actually happened to me at one time or another. I assure you when I use these real life human experiences as conversation starters, it usually gets people involved  and laughing about them together is fun. What are some of the appropriate, humorous, real life experiences that you could use as conversation starters at your next networking event? Im sure some of you are thinking, Do you believe Deborah admitted she was the target of birds during work in a business suit? Yep, and I had to go home and change. True story.","Infusionsoft CEO Clate Mask (above) and his executive team kicked off the companys annual conference, , with several product announcements. Among them: is entering the super-hot mobile payments space. This summer the company will offer a built-in payments solution in its marketing automation software platform. Rates will be competitive company executives say, at 2.9 percent plus 30 cents per each transaction. There is no setup fee. The payments solution has mobile capabilities so that small business users of Infusionsoft can accept payments from their customers while out of the office. Appearing before the crowd of over 3,000 business owners and partners at the Phoenix Convention Center, Mask said, Small business is a big deal. Small businesses have created a net of 18 million jobs in the last 5 years, Mask shared. Large companies have contracted their job pool by 2 million, he added. You are part of something big. Your success matters  a lot. It matters not only to you, your families, your employees and communities; it matters to the economy, too, he told the audience. Mask, together with his cofounders, Scott Martineau and Eric Martineau, related the story of Infusionsofts start in a strip mall. The company began as a software development company. We were working way too hard and making way too little money, he says. At one point, they got a visit from the police. They were erroneously suspected of being a meth lab because of people coming and going at all hours. The trio of co-founders saythey went through the small business owners paradox: the things that free you also bind you. So while many entrepreneurs start businesses in a bid for freedom, they end up with responsibilities such as having to make payroll. Addressing the thousands of small business owners Mask said, Thank you for never giving up. Infusionsofts product, he said, is being transformed from a sales and marketing platform to a small business success platform. Infusionsoft is designed to automate marketing tasks to free up small business owners and their limited staff. KyleLeavitt, Vice President of Product, said Infusionsoft will be introducing a variety of enhancements and new tools this year, including: It includes a library of email templates all responsive and optimized for mobile. This will be implemented in the fourth quarter of 2015. This visually-oriented function Infusionsoft introduced more thana year ago helps companies automate their marketing campaigns and visualize them in a flowchart format. Leavitt said the enhancements, to be introduced later this year, will make it even easier to use. The payments module will be introduced this summer. According to Leavitt, Infusionsoft users will be able to access full order history from mobile devices. Infusionsoft customers will have just one vendor to deal with and no manual actions or special integrations needed to implement a payments solution. A new online Help Center is being launched next week, and will include 24/7live support help. It is also accessible from mobile devices. Infusionsoft has had a reputation in the past as a powerful system yet with a steep learning curve. But the company is in the process of simplifying all aspects of it. Its going to be simple  and awesome, Leavitt enthusiastically told those gathered at the Phoenix Convention Center (pictured above). According to CRM industry analyst Brent Leary, Partner at , Infusionsoft has made with its product in recent years. When Infusionsoft started out, the product was complex. It could do a lot, but you almost needed a PhD to use it. Its been great to see over the past few years how its evolved. Theyve made it so much easier to use. You can get more things done with fewer steps. Analyst Paul Greenberg,President of agreed that the product has improved and hes impressed with the product simplicity. Its intelligently designed, too, with the small business user in mind, not an enterprise user. My favorite feature is My Day which shows your tasks for that day. Thats perfect for the small business user. Co-founder Scott Martineau reinforced the companys commitment to making the platform easier to use. When we first started developing software, we werent focused on simplicity. A lot more of our efforts now are focused on usability, said Martineau. In one sense, according to Leary, Infusionsoft is playing catch up by just now focusing on mobile-optimized email templates. Other competitors already offer those. But, he says, Infusionsoft has so many other things going for it compared with competitors. Infusionsoft customers make heavy use of email marketing, sending over 15 million emails each day. The announcement about the new Email Builder was met with a spontaneous round of applause in the event hall. In addition to the tech developments, Mask said that the Infusionsoft Marketplace will also be growing. The Marketplace is where Infusionsoft customers can find apps to integrate with other software applications they use, such as QuickBooks. Youll see an explosion in partnerships, Mask assured analysts in a special Q&A session. targets small businesses with up to 25employees, but can serve them as they grow, up to a hundredemployees. Last year, Infusionsoft secured a Series D round of funding in the amount of $55 million, led by Goldman Sachs. Company executives spoke openly about a potential IPO at some point in the future. Infusionsoft is based in Chandler, Arizona, and has 600 employees and more than 30,000 customers.","One of my best friends referred me to the book after we debated about technologys impact on society. Are our lives better now with the technology that has become widespread? Are we better people because we can share information so readily and instantaneously? Those questions are particularly poignant when we think about the potential usage of gadgets and capabilities developed just in the last year. Google Glass. The spread of mobile apps. The anticipation of an automated driving car. You can even look at the . Despite the eruption of opinions in that instance, one has to ponder the gigantic effort a small business can face when its reputation is in the combined hands of new tech (social media) and established tech (television). The books author Douglas Rushkoff ( has more than a light interest in tech-induced behavior. An award winning social critic, Rushkoff has written numerous books examining societal views of technology. The life questions in his latest book can inspire small business owners to assess their own beliefs on what is making their business and lives better for themselves, their associates, their employees and the family and friends who support them. According to Rushkoff, we made poor assumptions about how our lifestyle would change with technology. We thought we would be futurists  making the right predictions that matter. Instead, we have found no zen state with the events that occur through technological usage. Instead, Rushkoff notes, we have constant distractions, presuming that the information we have immediately before us is urgent. The end result is a narrative collapse  losing a linear progression of events that forms a story. We use narratives to tell the story about important events in our lives, let alone our business. Today, our environment assimilates bits and pieces of information, producing outcomes that demand personal vigilance and management. In addition to narrative collapse, Rushkoff summarizes other tenets to our digital environment: Within these titles, Rushkoff makes relatively good distinctions on the core symptoms of his societal diagnosis and notes the offshoots from the outlined tenets. Digiphrenia is meant to distinguish value from fragmented waste  the pay off is to not treat data flows and databases interchangeably, for example. That ability to distinguish value flows well into topics about our society as a whole. Check out how Rushkoff cites the Occupy Wall Street movement as a parallel to narrative collapse  with no goals from a narrative collapse, societal movements appear more frantic and extreme, sending a seemingly never-ending message stream instead of establishing an achievement. As I see todays analytics adopt more real time features, I do appreciate what Rushkoff sees. He outlines consequences that business can use as a starting point to understand if personnel are unnaturally aligned or if goals to integrate technology are unsustainable and unattainable. Read Rushkoffs citation of jet lag as an early example of an advancement impacting physiology: In its own way extends the dialog highlighted in by Lee Siegel, but with less cynicism about how information is created. Siegel cautioned on the internets destructive nature to obscure promises of free expression and independence. Rushkoff counters by having the reader note the tradeoffs, bullish that the reader will pick up the alarms: Much of the content is meant to appeal to readers who are not accustomed to reviewing code or software development, so a developer may not feel the book speaks to them. But if you are reading other business books on technology you will imagine some useful parallels. Rushkoffs discussion on reduced critical thinking parallels cautions being on customer service autopilot as Chris Zane warns in his book He highlights the always-on philosophy that works well for many businesses , while our digital selves are distributed across every device, platform, and network. Rushkoff is a proactive critic  he shuttered his Facebook page, critical of its sponsored stories feature and subsequent data usage. I think after reading this book youll become pretty proactive in setting your own technological strategy.","Making it through school can be difficult if you dont have any help.

Luckily, Studypool has taken off. But if it hadnt worked, the decision to drop out of school could have delayed or ruined other career options. Hiring more full-time developers. With more developers, Werbe says they could continue to improve the Studypool product. Work as a close-knit team. All of the Studypool team members are good friends.

And yet youve got this nagging feeling that youre not making the most of your website traffic. Despite the many tools out there, I find that most of us have a similar sentiment. The nagging feeling stems from the fact that our sites bring in tons of traffic of all sorts: prospects, customers, partners, competitors, friends, wanderers, etc. There are many different tools to help us analyze these different types of traffic. It can get pretty confusing when you start to throw all of these tools into the mix. And it certainly seems that even with all these tools, we can still be left guessing about some of our traffic. So, what are some of the tools that help us make sense of it all? Ill share a few off the top of my head: is great to help us systematically tailor our message to attract the prospects we want. With Google Analytics, were able to monitor the pulse of conversions with their stellar Goal Tracking abilities. , multivariate testing and extensive SEO efforts are great ways to target more ideal prospects and cultivate more educated customers. The goal in using all these features and tools is to obtain actionable data that you can make decisions with. But what about mining your site visitor activity for prospect data that your sales reps can act on? You can use custom code and various triggers if your IT team can put it out on the site and maintain it, but Ive found that a simple tool like is a better, easier way to go. Your reps can get notified when someone is visiting the site and they can see reports in real time to find out whos really kicking the tires. LeadLander is also pretty good for providing insight on the competitors that are snooping around your site. You can see what pages people visited, what they did on your site and what time they were there. This data is useful competitive intelligence, but if you want to take it a step further (and cough up more dough), is a great service to really keep tabs on your competitors. All of these tools offer great value. Ive used these tools, as well as a few custom tools to capture site visitor data, and yet I continue to have the nagging feeling that were not learning enough about our website traffic. The more I talk to folks about this, the more I realize Im not alone. What are you using to analyze your website traffic, how do you act on that analytical data and do you still have that nagging feeling? * * * * * Clate Mask is the President and CEO of .

The announcement came during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. New products look a lot like a new news brand for the Web giant. The trouble is that Yahoos target audience seems to be, not a small niche group, butwell, everybody! The independent news brand can be a fertile opportunity for small online businesses and digital startups. By focusing on a small niche group, small publishers can deliver specially created or curated news and information. That content is tailored specifically for an underserved audience. Think for Libertarian conservatives, for liberal progressives, for the tech startup community, and for the online marketing community. Some of these brands have since been acquired by larger companies. But the key to their early success, and in many ways to their continued growth, has come from serving these groups. It was the same with Mashable, started as a tech blog by current CEO Pete Cahmore at 19 and run from home. But last week, , its first outside investment. With the money, Mashable will open more editorial offices and hire more journalists to create more original content. The company has already expanded its categories of news coverage from primarily tech and social media to include business, entertainment and other topics. However, stories covered are still aimed specifically at a Web savvy audience. By contrast, seems built on the notion that theres too much information out there already. Theres also the implication that a large news company not a small independent news brand should decide whats important to customers. Yahoo product manager Nick DAloisio explains: So, Yahoo News Digest uses an algorithm and some human curating to put together the top stories (about nine of them) the company feels you should see. One digest will be delivered on the app in the morning and one in the evening. There will also be some extra stories that didnt make the cut. These digests will be gathered from multiple sources in segments called atoms including text, infographics, maps, video, financial tickers and more, says DAloisio. But theres no talk of giving users the content they want, or for that matter of who the news apps target audience might be. Heres more on the app from D Aloisio: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNwxTSD1g7A Yahoo is also unveiling a group of digital magazines. David Pogue is a vice president of editorial for Yahoo and a former correspondent for The New York Times. He introduced one of the publications entitled at the Las Vegas event. Another magazine called has already been launched with more on the way, CNET reports. But here again, Yahoos offering seems to suffer from a lack of purpose. Pogue describes Yahoo Tech as a publication for the 85 percent of the U.S. outside the more technically sophisticated areas of New York City and the West Cost. (In other words, the magazine will be tech for non-tech people?) Mayer also introduced Katie Couric, a former television reporter and host for all three of the major networks.Yahoo recently announced Couric as its new global anchor. Couric said she hopes to interview news makers, politicians, sports figures, philanthropists, tech leaders and social entrepreneurs. (Dont we all?) But it was less clear what specific audience the new Yahoo content would serve. In short, Yahoo seems to be banking on its well-known brand to give it a large general customer base for its general news product. But company leaders dont seem to have thought much about what niche that content is targeted to reach. Its too early to determine whether this approach will be effective. However, it is the opposite of the strategy used successfully by most independent news brands in recent years. When creating independent branded news as part of your business, focus carefully on the audience or customers you most wish to reach. Start by targeting the customers most likely to buy the products or visit the advertisers you have on your site.","If youre like many small business owners today, your workplace includes three generations of employees: boomers, Gen X and Gen Y/Millennials. and how some companies handle this issue. Although the examples used were large companies, theres a lot that small businesses can learn. They value security and stability, and appreciate clearly stated goals and tasks. They prefer to communicate through in-person meetings and emails. (born roughly between 1965 and 1981) They are adaptable and resourceful, and most have learned to use digital technology and communicate with the latest tech tools. (born roughly between 1982 and 2001) They value work-life balance and flexibility even more than Gen X. They also seek freedom and want to be treated as equals from their first day on the job. This generation doesnt fear authority, and seeks challenging and meaningful work. And theyre the most tech-savvy of the three groups, preferring to communicate quickly via texting and IM. Each generation has unique strengths, clearlybut their strengths may also be perceived as weaknesses by the other age groups. How can you keep your three generations of employees working harmoniously as a team? Take a page from these big-company strategies: At IBM, a Generational Diversity program assesses employees career life cycles and the different needs a person may have at all stages of their career. As a small business owner, youre in an even better position to learn what each employee values, wants and needs to be most productive. For instance, Boomers will probably relish being put in charge of a project; a Gen-Xer will appreciate the autonomy to complete a task her way; and a Millennial will enjoy sharing ideas with a creative team working together. When an older employee leaves the company because he or she no longer feels valued, your business loses valuable institutional knowledge. Make sure your older staffers dont feel like theyre being pushed aside for younger team members. Make extra efforts to keep them engaged and show that their contributions are valued. Fire up meetings or brainstorming sessions by including employees from all age levels. A diverse group means more viewpoints and more creativity. Having staff members from different generations gives your business an advantage, so use it! Especially in a group setting such as a team project or meeting, make sure that you show how much you appreciate what each worker brings to the team. Encourage workers to share their knowledge, whether its an entry-level Millennial showing a Boomer manger how to use social media or a Boomer employee explaining the history of a long-term client to a Gen X salesperson. Its easy for employees to become adversarial when they focus on their differences. Continually remind your team of its common goalswinning new business, growing sales or whatever your company is working to achieve. Pulling together will help overcome generational differences and build tighter bonds.","Meg Whitman, the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, said in the latest quarterly earnings conference callthat the market for personal computers is in a slow decline.

Sales of printers were also down slightly, but also outperformed the market according to Whitman. Almost no mention was made of small businesses in the HP earnings conference call. In such a large company, the small-business segmentgets tucked under either the commercial or the consumer side for financials, depending on the product. Whitman said the numbers posted are part of HPs multi-year turnaround, and the turnaround is on track, explaining: But the shift has not been without costs. HPannounced it would be eliminating another 11,000 to 16,000 jobs. That wouldbring the total number of eliminated positions to upwards of 50,000 people. The staffreductions, Whiteman said, areto make up for numerous acquisitions that were never properly integrated for efficiencies. HP plans toget into 3D printing sometime in 2014. Whitman said with Jim Cramer onCNBC that HP is focused on business 3D printing, not the consumer side.

Nothing to Hide is a cream-based acne solution that Austin created after extensive research during his time in nursing school. Using natural and organic ingredients. According to Plexylabs, Nothing to Hide is the only acne treatment that uses Beta-Sitosterol, a completely natural compound. The ingredient can also be found in everyday food choices like fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Austin says: This ingredient targets oil glands to treat acne from the source. Some other acne treatments target oil in general, but some of it is actually necessary for normal functions. So the aim of this treatment is to actually restore oil balance in the skin in a natural way. Looking for a way to treat their own acne. Austin started doing some research about acne treatments in 2012 during his time in nursing school.

During Austins research, the Beta-Sitosterol ingredient was the first one that really worked on a different level than the standard ingredients. He says: Take risks. Austin says the biggest risk was just jumping in and starting the business. But so far it has worked out and he says he wouldnt change a thing. PR and advertising. Being a family business.

You probably already know how to change your mailing address or switch your cable service. But how do you legally move a corporation or LLC from one state to another? When a corporation or LLC conducts business in any given state, it must register with that state. So, if youre planning to move your business to a new state, youll need to register it with that state. In general, there are two ways to handle this  and the right approach will depend on whether your move is permanent and whether youre planning on operating your business in both your old and new states. If youre permanently moving to a new state and you have no plans on operating your business in the old state, then the cleanest approach is to close the corporation/LLC in your original state and register a new corporation or LLC in the new state. While specifics may vary by state, heres a general overview of how to do this: In those situations where your move is only temporary or youd still like to conduct business in your old state, then it doesnt make sense to close your business and start a new one. In this case, you should keep your corporation or LLC registered in the original state and then foreign qualify in your new state. This is also the procedure youd take if youre not moving, but just plan on conducting business in another state. Heres a general overview of how to foreign qualify (again, specifics vary by state): Summer moves can be busy. Yet in the midst of a physical move, youll also need to take your legal obligations seriously whenever crossing state borders.

The latest advent of this series will feature a stylus pen, according to new information from the company. The announcement comes just days ahead of LGs official unveiling of the aptly-named G3 Stylus at the IFA conference in Berlin. The G3 Stylus will join the G3 Beat, the G Vista and the original G3 . LG says the G3 Stylus will have DNA borrowed from its predecessors. The company has not given an indication on the price of the G3 Stylus other than to say it will be fairly priced. There are also no details yet about when it will be available in the U.S. market. But the device will feature a 5.5-inch Quad HD (qHD) display. The smartphone will be pre-loaded with apps that are designed for use with its proprietary Rubberdium stylus pen, according to the LG announcement.

The cashier weights it to be approximately 4.5 kg and 1.25 kg respectively and hands him a few crisp notes. The farmer pockets the money and walks away. The entire process took no less than six minutes. There were no delays, negotiations, middlemen or disappointments. But Mandya wasnt like this a year ago. In July 2015, more than 20 sugarcane farmers committed suicide. Perennially irrigated and verdant, Mandya is just about 100 km from Bengaluru. But the farmers are under the weight of heavy debt. Reports estimate that Mandya farmers owe banks Rs 1,200 crore in loans taken over the past year (2014-15). Government apathy, falling crop prices, excess stock and lack of guidance on proper farming techniques are the many reasons contributing to the grim scenario. Disturbed by these prevailing conditions was 37-year-old MadhuChandan Chikkadevaiah, an IT professional living the life of dreams in California, but having roots in Mandya. Hailing from a family of farmers, Madhu was born in Mandya and spent his entire childhood in the sprawling 300 acres of University of Agriculture, Bengaluru, where his father retired as a Vice Chancellor. While Madhu went on to become a software engineer who worked across the globe, co-founded Verifaya Corporation that delivers automated software testing solutions to companies, he was always a farmer at heart. In August 2014, he quit everything in less than a fortnight and came back to Mandya  to help the farming community flourish. He says, He further explains, When Madhu moved to Mandya, the first thing he noticed was a scattered landscape. There were many farmers who had shifted to organic methods, and practising indigenous techniques that were giving them decent yields. Yet, there were glaring gaps  lack of an organised market and information exchange. Madhus first step was to gather passionate individuals (friends and ex-colleagues) who pooled in Rs 1 crore and he registered Mandya Organic Farmers Cooperative Society, bringing together nearly 240 organicfarmers in the first phase. It took him eight months to complete all the government formalities and also establish Organic Mandya  the brand under which farmers will sell their produce. He says, Madhu decided to leverage the Mandya Highway that connects Bengaluru and Mysuru, and he was convinced that travellers would stop by to buy his produce. To further enthuse people, he started an organic restaurant next to the shop. He says, The real beauty of Organic Mandya is Madhus idea of connecting the farmers and customers. According to him, Thats how the companys Organic Tourism initiative took birth which has the following  Its just been around six months since Organic Mandya has been fully operational and its well on its way to success. The cooperative has already over 500 registered farmers who collectively own close to 200 acres of land and are producing over 70 varieties for sale  rice, dals and pulses, edible oils, personal healthcare products, beverages, masalas and spices. In terms of revenue, the company reached Rs one crore in just four months. The monthly baskets priced at Rs 999, Rs 1,499 and Rs 1,999 have found many takers. After all, who doesnt want healthy supplies that will last an entire month that can be ordered online and delivered right at your doorstep, asks Madhu. But most importantly, Mandya is seeing reverse migration. Madhu says, Madhu is well aware that sustainability is an important aspect for any business to flourish. But he wants to ensure that sustainability benefits both  farmers and customers. In the next one year, Madhu is working towards cultivating 10,000 families to generate revenues of approximately Rs 30 crore by making them buy monthly supplies averaging to approximately Rs 2,000 to 3,000. He says, The idea is to get families to register as our members, which will cost Rs 1,000 annually. This will have dual benefits  one is they will get a steep discount on all our products for the entire year, and second is we will introduce them to a range of healthy eating practices.","The new Amazon Fire Phone announced this afternoon in Seattle by the online mega-retailer has specs that put it on par with Motorolas Moto X.

Lior writes: Personally, I think this a great move by Google and one that should have been done from the very beginning. Keeping Hotpot as a separate entity (especially with such an odd name) took away from what Google was trying to do because it broke the connection between reviews and a particular location.  Now that its all housed under the same roof, it does help to simplify things and shows reviews as a natural component to doing business, for both users and business owners.  Dont get me wrong, creating a unique brand is great, but not when it takes away from your core mission and what youre trying to get across to users. This is a smart move by Google. If you want normal Internet users to adopt the process of reviews, you need to make it intuitive and seamless.  The Hotpot review process, itself, is. However, banishing it to its own identity was not. Now that Hotpot has taken its rightful place under the Google Places umbrella, Im sure this is only the beginning. Back in December I wrote about , and encouraged SMBs to start heavily going after reviews. As a small business owner, if you werent leveraging online reviews, especially Google Place reviews, then you may want to up your strategy in this area.

Online resources and marketplaces like Etsy have made it incredibly easy for almost anyone to turn a hobby or creative passion into a business. But with so many of these businesses popping up daily, it can be a challenge to make one really stand out. Still, Anne-Marie Faiola, a former correctional officer, has managed to build not just one, but two successful handmade businesses, and . Both businesses were inspired by Faiolas passion for soap making, which started when she was just 16 years old. During her years as a correctional officer, she began selling her handmade soap. And she enjoyed small business ownership so much that she decided a career change was in order. But Bramble Berry isnt just another handmade soap retailer. Faiola liked the idea of helping other entrepreneurs and soap makers, so she created the business to provide soap ingredients and supplies. She set up a website and funded the business using credit cards in 1998. Then, after more than a decade of growing her company, Faiola got another idea. She often used crafting subscription boxes to save time in buying her own supplies. And she knew of a lot of people who were interested in soap making, but didnt feel like they had the time or knowledge to get started. So she decided to start a subscription box for soap making and similar beauty supplies. For Handmade Beauty Box, Faiola turned to Kickstarter for funding. And thanks to a carefully planned strategy and some word of mouth, she ended up raising more than four times the original goal. While almost anyone can start a handmade business, this type of success isnt easy to come by. Faiola had a few key ingredients that contributed to the sustainability of both businesses. She had the passion and knowledge about soap making. She also had a unique idea of providing supplies for hobbyists and other entrepreneurs, rather than just sticking to selling a singular finished product like so many others. And she put the hard work into making both businesses a success. While running a handmade business can certainly be fun and rewarding, Faiola cautions fellow entrepreneurs not to forget about those all-important business aspects. Treat your business like a business. Even if its something youre doing because youre passionate about it, you still need to put food on your table, she explained in an email interview with Small Business Trends. But no matter how much entrepreneurial savvy you have, the passion and personality of handmade businesses is often what sets them apart. And it can be a challenge sometimes to separate yourself from your business, because of this, Faiola says. There is so much personality and passion that you put into your own handmade business; you pour yourself into projects and really imbue your craft with a little piece of your creative soul. So, when someone doesnt want your product, the rejection can feel very personal, she ads. Still, those who can maintain that professional distance, like Faiola and so many other creative entrepreneurs, have been able to make a living doing what they love.","Its called the Micro and developers of the device call it the first consumer 3D printer. A crowdfunding on Kickstarter, and has already raised well over the amount needed to put the device into production. Maryland-based developers M3D have said that the 7.3 inch cube, weighing about half a pound, can be used for a variety of purposes, including creating items for a business. As an example, TechCrunch that was then used to make specially branded chocolate bars. You could also make other things such as promotional trinkets to hand out, and small items to sell. To quote the Kickstarter page : This video from the Kickstarter campaign gives an overview of the device: What makes this 3D printer stand out is the price. Normally the prices for 3D printers are prohibitively high, and therefore out of the range of ordinary consumers and some small businesses. But the Micro will cost a very affordable $299 and should be ready between August 2014 and March 2015. It is also supposed to be ideal for beginners, who are just starting out in 3D printing. Because of their high price and complexity, 3D printing seemed firmly in the grip of specialists before this. In fact, last year the UPS Stores announced at some locations to make them available for small businesses. But the Micro seems to be taking 3D printing to the general public, both with cost and apparent simplicity of operation. Of course, as TechCrunch points out, at $299, some corners were probably cut. So dont expect top quality results. Remember the old saying you get what you pay for. The printer comes with specially designed companion software to enable you to download and select what you would like to make. 3D modeling designs are only a Google search away, and the software helps you to download the ones you are interested in. The software is touchscreen-capable and has a minimalist interface. If you want one of the first ones off the production line, you have until May 7 to become a backer on Kickstarter.","Amazons new is raising the bar for competitive pricing,  or is that lowering the bar?

Compare this price to other similar services that charge per month, some of which are not even offering unlimited cloud storage, and you will notice a sizeable gap. Google Drive offers unlimited cloud storage but at $10 a month. Thats double what Amazon is offering. Dropbox is similar, offering unlimited storage but at an even higher price of $15 a month. There are cheaper plans with less storage offered by iCloud and Microsoft OneDrive. However, neither service offers unlimited storage and their largest plans are still more expensive than the new Amazon package. Pricing for iCloud ranges from a free 5GB plan to $20 a month for 1TB. Microsoft OneDrive also has a 1TB cap but at a cheaper $7 a month. In addition to Unlimited Everything, Amazon is also offering an Unlimited Photos plan. For $12 a year, users can have access to unlimited photo storage plus 5GB of storage for videos and other various files. This deal may not be quite so impressive when compared to the free 15GB of storage Microsoft OneDrive offers. But still, the unlimited photo storage may have an appeal to some users. For those who have an Amazon Prime account, you already have unlimited photo storage plus those 5GB of additional storage. Amazon has stated on its website this service will continue and Prime members will not have to start paying extra for it. For anyone else interested in trying out either of Amazons new storage plans, the company is offering 3-month free trials of each. Even with the lowest prices around, not everyone will want to use Amazon Cloud Drive to store their photos and documents. Some dont care for Amazons interface and others may not find the draw of lower prices enough incentive to move over all their files. Still, Amazons new rock bottom unlimited storage prices are a game changer.","If youve been receiving more credit card payments in your small business lately, you may soon be getting a notice from the Internal Revenue Service. Media reports suggest the IRS has sent out 20,000 of these 1099-K notices since fall 2012 mostly to small businesses. Form 1099-K is the return on which small businesses must report payment card and third party network transactions including credit card payments. The official IRS website explains the reason for the 1099-K notice this way: Specifically, the IRS businesses whose ratio of credit card to cash seems unusual for their industry, a CNN report suggests. The agency seems to believe these higher than average credit card reportings mean businesses are underreporting cash receipts. Its certainly important for small businesses to accurately report their earnings and pay their fair share. But its also possible a simpler explanation exists for high credit card receipts. Customers in the U.S. are increasingly choosing plastic to make their purchases and small businesses here are eager to accommodate. According to , point of sale cash payments are expected to decline to just 23 percent by 2017. Over the same period, credit card purchases are expected to climb to 33 percent. They were only 29 percent of point of sales purchases in 2011. Whats more, 68 percent of consumers between ages 18 and 33 will only shop at businesses that accept multiple forms of payment including credit cards. So this trend is likely to continue. If you receive a notice from the IRS about your 1099-K reporting, dont panic. 1.) Your income tax return should already include the earnings reported on your 1099-K as part of your businesss gross receipts. So the IRS recommends checking all your tax records to determine whether the agencys assessment is correct. 2.) The IRS also suggests you talk with your tax professional if necessary for some assistance and to decide how to proceed.","A Twitter attack caused thousands of peoples accounts to retweet a single message this week. But this was apparently only if the original tweet that started the trouble was viewed through TweetDeck, a popular application used to manage Twitter accounts. The tweet contained a code that exploited a bug in TweetDeck in turn setting off the spontaneous retweets. That code appears in the tweet below: Dont worry, though. The bug in TweetDeck has apparently since been fixed. So this code should no longer affect Twitter accounts, even if it is viewed through your version of TweetDeck. The incident was the result of a cross-site scripting attack. The attack exploited a vulnerability allowing an outside user to inject a malicious code into the system. The code was designed to take over, at least temporarily, active sessions on Twitter. The more often the coded message was retweeted, the more Twitter users were affected. At last estimate,at least 87,000 Twitter accounts had been touched by the attack, Ars Technica. TweetDeck finally shut its service down to address the issue. Within an hour, the TweetDeck team reported they had fixed the problem and returned the system to normal. The Twitter attack was apparently unintentionally initiated by a 19-year-old from Austria. Using only the names Florian or Firo when with CNN on Twitter, he said he had accidentally discovered the vulnerability. But while he was trying to warn Twitter, he said others in the online hacker community noticed his communication and used the vulnerability to attack the site.","The so-called Internet Sales Tax isnt dead, despite what you may have heard. Heres what happened: Last week, a millennial advocacy group called Generation Opportunity planned a so-called Facebook bomb of . Rep. Goodlatte happens to be the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which is considering the Internet Sales Tax (known officially as the Marketplace Fairness Act.) The group claims it inundated the Republican Congressmans Facebook page with more than 3,000 comments urging him to stall the bill in his committee so it never reaches the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives for a vote. While they may have gotten the response they wanted from Goodlatte, the group apparently inferred more than the Congressman intended to say. In a statement from Generation Opportunity, it said Goodlatte told the group that the Judiciary Committee would not take up the Marketplace Fairness Act. Generation Opportunity said Goodlattes comment to them effectively kills the bill, last week. After a local Virginia TV station picked up on that story and contacted Goodlatte, the Congressman clarified his message and gave the Internet Sales Tax bill some life, but not much. He , Whatever Goodlatte means by alternatives, it doesnt seem to quite add up to the killing of the bill Generation Opportunity had claimed. proposed legislation anyway. Though it recently passed the U.S. Senate, it will need to be approved by the House before its sent to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. If passed as is, the legislation would require most online merchants to collect sales tax from their customers, including those in states where the merchants have no established location. Thats good news for affiliate marketers who claim the bill is a good alternative to   requiring companies like Amazon to pay sales tax if sales to its site come through affiliates based in some states. The nexus taxes have caused some companies to discontinue association with affiliates in states where they exist, advocates for the affiliate industry say. On the other hand, Ebay, which advocates for thousands of small merchants using its services for online selling, says the law, if passed, will be a regulatory nightmare. It could make these merchants responsible for complying with 9,600 state and local tax jurisdictions across the country depending on the location of each customer. But even if the Internet Sales Tax bill isnt dead yet, it may still have little chance of ever passing. , there is much less support for the bill in the House than in the Senate, so the bill may stall in committee with or without activist efforts.","Google recently unveiled a new tool that allows you to view a variety of the companys research, in one place, through a simple to browse dashboard.

Yet while the process may be straightforward enough, small business owners can unknowingly make some common missteps that can have a significant impact on the business. Your business entity affects the amount of taxes you pay, the employee benefits you can offer, the amount of paperwork you deal with and more. In the U.S., the three most common business structures are the LLC (limited liability company), S corporation and C corporation. All three entities protect the personal assets of the owners from liability, yet differ when it comes to tax treatment, etc. What are some of the common mistakes made when it comes to business entity? For example: Many business owners think they should choose between Delaware or Nevada when incorporating or forming an LLC. And, yes, Delaware offers some of the most developed, flexible and pro-business statutes in the country. Nevada offers low filing fees, and has no state corporate income, franchise or personal income taxes. However, these two states arent necessarily the best choices for every business. For the small business (defined here as one with fewer than five shareholders), its better to incorporate in the state where you have a physical presence. Otherwise, there can be too many hassles associated with operating out of state. These include difficulties opening a business bank account, having to appoint a registered agent, and fees for operating as a foreign entity in your own state. With legal document filing services, you dont actually need to hire your own lawyer to form an LLC or corporation. In this case, the online service can help you represent yourself to create a business entity. The service can ensure that you have provided all the necessary paperwork right to your states specifications. However, a legal document filing service is not allowed to give you advice regarding your specific situation. Therefore, if you have a particularly complex partnership or financial situation, you should seek the counsel of an attorney. Keeping your LLC or corporation compliant is essential, and continues long after you filed your initial application. A plaintiff may try to show that you have not maintained your LLC or corporation to the letter of the law, and if that attempt is successful, your corporate shield will be pierced, putting your personal assets at risk. To keep your corporation or LLC in compliance, you need to: The top mistake a small business owner can make is never forming an LLC or corporation in the first place. This puts your key personal assets (savings, retirement fund, property, etc.) at risk. By avoiding these five common missteps, you can better protect your assets, minimize your liability, lower your expenses and enjoy a legally structured business for years to come.","Yes, theres an app for that too.

But weve also seen some issues for small business owners. If youve got your contacts in your CRM or similar software, wheres the connection between that platform and your email, which is where most of us do the bulk of our daily interactions with customers? , anonline marketing software provider, just announced the arrival of to addressthe connection between CRM and employees daily email usage to interact with customers. Richard Tripp, chief product officer at Infusionsoft, said the problem the company wanted to help marketers and marketing staff in small businesses with, was that disconnect between CRM and their email: The freeGmail integration, which was acquired from an Infusionsoft Marketplace Partner, Benji Rabhan and the team at , providesimmediate visibility into appointments, centralized contacts and communications within Gmail, and better interactions with clients. It works with Firefox and Chrome browsers. Heres an example of how the Infusionsoft Gmail integration works. Lets say a marketer didnt use this integration. Shes got her CRM with all her client data and contact information, which she manually transferred to the CRM platform. If she has a task to complete for the client, she opens her project management platform, like Basecamp, and sets up the task and due date. She knows she needs to follow up to an email by the end of the week, so she makes an item on her Google Calendar. And because she has a quick question best addressed by phone, she has to open her CRM program to get the clients phone number (its not in an email). You can see in this example, this process involves a lot of switching between programs and wasting a lot of time. The Infusionsoft Gmail integration aims to deal with that. Heres an example with the integration to illustrate how it works: Ms. Marketer logs into her Infusionsoft account directly from her Gmail sidebar. She opens an email from a client, and up pops the corresponding profile from the CRM software. She can add or review tasks that relate to this client, as well as see what opportunities she may be able to work on. She can see what tasks or appointments are pending, and do any followup that the CRM alerts her is needed. Shes got all of the clients contact info there too, so she doesnt have to hunt for that phone number. It is all in one place. A year and a half ago, when I covered , the company was servicing just over 8,000 small businesses. That number has grown to50,000 small business users spread across 70 countries.","If you own a recent iPhone or iPad, you know what Siri is. For those who dont, were going to briefly explain Siri, including what it does, and some alternatives to Siri. is the name of a module for voice commands on Apple devices. Siri lets you control the iPhone with your voice. You can ask Siri questions using your voice  without typing. Siri answers in a human-sounding voice, also. You can use Siri to search the Web, send emails, find text messages and read them to you out loud, post social media updates, make phone calls, and even set up appointments or reminders. You can also use Siri as a dictation device to dictate notes you want to remember. Because of those types of activities, Apple calls Siri a personal assistant. Siri is built into recent-model Apple devices so there is nothing for you to download. Its already available. Apple says that you dont need to talk slowly or pronounce things carefully  you can speak in a natural voice. Theres no need to teach it  although like most voice recognition programs it does get better the more you use it, as it does learn to recognize your speech patterns. Siri was launched with a media campaign that featured Samuel L. Jackson in one commercial (embedded below). At first, while Siri was still a novelty, people wrote about it and used it. But after a while, . people found that it wasnt 100% accurate. One report put accuracy at under 70% in delivering correct responses. The way it works is that your requests and commands to Siri are uploaded to Apple servers somewhere, interpreted, and then a response comes back to you. Some companies, like IBM, at one point on privacy and security grounds, because its not clear what happens to the queries and whether they are saved by Apple. There are alternatives. These are considered two of the best:  Google has voice activated search for Android devices. You can request a variety of things.  By Nuance Communications, the makers of Dragon voice activated software, comes this mobile assistant. Our take: while Siri and other mobile assistants hold promise, they arent at the point where they can be relied upon 100% of the time with 100% accuracy. However, if you are looking for a way to be more productive in your daily work, these mobile assistants can cut down time.","When Donna DeMarco and Robert Sandie launched their interactive online video startup, they didnt move it to a major tech hub like Silicon Valley. Instead, they kept their company, , headquartered in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. And DeMarco thinks that decision has ultimately been beneficial for the business. The pair originally met in a class at , where they worked on a group assignment together. For the project, they added some interactive elements to an episode of childrens television show . The additions would allow children to drag-and-drop or point to items so they could better interact with and learn from the show. After the class, DeMarco and Sandie went out for drinks and decided that it was too cool of an idea to just use as a project for a class. So they started building it into a business. They originally built their company as an online platform for user-generated content and called it InteractiveTube. But because of bandwidth issues and a little company called YouTube that was exploding in popularity at the time, building a site with a good enough end-user experience to compete was tough. So instead, the company changed directions and its name. Now, Viddler provides video solutions for clients who are looking to provide interactive training or corporate communications to employees or trainees. But through its launch and transformation, the Bethlehem community has been a big part of the company. Initially, the co-founders used money from winning a business plan competition at Lehigh University to cover the companys server costs. Then, the company became part of the incubator. And later it also joined the (PI) incubator in Southside Bethlehem. The school and business incubators certainly had a big impact on Viddlers success. But aside from that, DeMarco said there have been lots of benefits to keeping the business in a smaller community. She said in a phone interview with Small Business Trends, Cost of living is obviously a lot lower here, along with a lot of other expenses. Were also a stones throw away from Philadelphia and New York City, where we have a lot of clients. And then theres also the virtual aspect. In the beginning especially, we basically lived on Skype and had people from all around the world working for us. So it just never even occurred to us to leave. Of course, not every small town will have those amenities or the proximity to major cities. But the emergence of coworking spaces, virtual workers and similar resources has made for every business. Some small communities will make starting a business easier than others. And and on how those communities accommodate their startups. So whether youve already started a business or are considering doing so, a smaller community can be an asset to you if you know what to look for. DeMarco suggests, Find an area where they support entrepreneurs and small businesses. There are tons of incubators and other resources around the country, not just in California.","Youve heard of startup entrepreneurs beginning with nothing. But few have probably started with less than Leo Grand. After losing his job with MetLife, Grand also lost his home when rent on his apartment skyrocketed leaving him on the streets. So it may be hard to believe that after nearly two years of living in shelters, he has not only learned a new skill that should make him more employable Grand is also now an entrepreneur. He has launched his own app, , to promote carpooling as a way to help the environment. The app is designed to connect drivers and riders. The app is available on Google Play and the Apple app store for 99 cents and heres a video pitch from Grand urging prospective users to download it: Of course, Grand did not do all of this alone. Earlier this year, good samaritan and software engineer Patrick McConlogue offered the homeless man an important choice. McConlogue would give Grand $100 to meet his immediate needs or, instead, he would buy Grand a laptop and teach him to write code. Grand NBC News he hopes his choice will change peoples minds about the homeless: Getting to this point hasnt been easy. Grand spent an hour a day being tutored by McConlogue and then many hours working on his own There were setbacks along the way, of course. In October, Grand was arrested by New York City police for sleeping on a park bench, Gothamist.com . And his precious laptop was confiscated. But with perseverance and the help of friends, he kept going. Today he hopes for more than just the success of his app. He is also looking for a job and a place to live. Meanwhile, his experiences so far have inspired another startup. McConlogue hopes soon to a complete Journeyman Course teaching others how to code for free.","A U.S. debt default has been averted and many federal agencies have reopened. But at least one group of small businesses wont recover so easily from the weeks of government shutdown. No, it wont be small businesses waiting on Small Business Administration backed loans. Critics have pointed out who really need it than many Americans realize. And its not even federal contractors. Sure, waiting for money over the shutdown likely caused an inconvenience. Still, most get paid per contract once the government starts operating again. Thats to National Federation of Independent Business economist, Bill Dunkelberg. No, one of the hardest hit groups may be small tourism and related businesses. This is particularly true of the businesses located around the 401 National Park sites closed during the shutdown. Estimated losses around one large national park alone are staggering. Businesses within 60 miles of the 800 square mile Great Smoky Mountains National Park may have missed out on $33 million in visitor revenues. And thats just in the first 10 days of the shutdown, economist Steve Morse of Western Carolina University CNN Money. Unlike federal contractors, for example, these businesses never see revenues replenished when things get back to normal. When tourists cancel vacations, the money to local businesses for the season is lost permanently. Thats why state and local funding was used to reopen the Statue of Liberty in New York City and Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona during the shutdown, Bloomberg Radio. Projections showed six rafting businesses at Grand Canyon alone would have lost a combined $1 million in the final weeks of the 2013 rafting season. Thats not counting restaurants, hotels and other lodgings, gas stations, outfitters and many other businesses serving the tourist industry. Many Washington politicians say they support small businesses  but what do their actions demonstrate?","With another tax filing deadline in the rearview mirror, most people dont think about taxes until the next year. However, take a few moments to review your return before you stock it away. This years return can provide valuable information on the financial health of your business, as well as show you ways to improve your tax situation in time for next years filing. Do you feel like you are paying too much in self-employment taxes? Youre not alone, especially considering the rate for 2013 is higher than it has been the past few years. If you make self-employed income, theres not a lot you can do to avoid this tax completely. However, you can check with your CPA or tax advisor to see if changing your business structure to a corporation or LLC thats taxed like an S Corporation can help lower your SE taxes. In addition, the most important strategy for dealing with self-employment taxes is making sure your prices reflect this increased cost of doing business. Employers and employees typically split Medicare and Social Security taxes. But when youre self-employed, you are on the hook for the whole thing. This higher cost needs to be factored into your pricing. To make the most of your business tax deductions, youll need accurate, comprehensive records. If you dont keep track of your business expenses throughout the year, trying to remember every expense and round up every receipt can be a major hassle. Some legitimate expenses are bound to slip through the cracks, meaning youll end up paying more in taxes than you should. If you struggled to prepare your records, receipts, and other documents this year, make a plan to get organized for your 2014 return. Find a method for documenting expenses that works for you. There are dedicated apps like for tracking expenses, for recording mileage, or for capturing paper receipts. In addition, your accounting program, like , , or will let you record and manage expenses. Youll be grateful come tax time next year. Your tax return can tell you whether youve made the most of your retirement savings options. If you havent, its a good idea to change your habits. After all, when you are self-employed, you are fully responsible for your retirement savings. For example, if you qualify for a SEP-IRA and didnt make the full contribution last year, see if you can step up your savings this year. The same advice goes to employees who arent contributing their full share to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. What does your Schedule C or 1120/1120-S look like? Does your balance sheet show mainly profit, with few expenses? While most business owners want to keep their company running in the black, it is possible that you are not strategically expensing your costs throughout the year to keep your tax bill down. Discuss your options with a CPA. Perhaps youll need to make a few key technology or marketing investments this year, or expense more travel and entertaining costs. Did you discover that you didnt put away enough to cover your 2013 taxes? Did your estimated tax payments fall way short? Businesses, including self-employed sole proprietors, are required to pay taxes on a quarterly basis. While this may be the law, its also good practice as waiting to pay a years worth of taxes in one lump sum can be quite a shock. If you had to write a big check with your 2013 return, youll need to be more disciplined this year. Get into the habit of automatically setting aside a percentage of each payment/revenue for your tax obligations. Then, take stock of your profit/loss statement at each quarter and pay your quarterly bill accordingly. A financial advisor can help you estimate these payments if you need some help. Remember that paying taxes is a year-long obligation, not just something to think about once a year. Take some time to reflect on your 2013 taxes  the tax return lessons learned will help streamline the process, and potentially lower your tax bill for years to come.","Whats so important about Word-of-Mouth? You hear and read a lot about word-of-mouth marketing. Every day theres another resource or opinion about it. I can only answer this from my experience as CEO of a small company. But word-of-mouth is so important to a companys success, especially a small company, that it should be the core of your business. Why? It creates a sustainable business model. Every business seeks to be self-sustaining. And a strategy built around generating word-of-mouth is a sustainable strategy. How? It levels the playing field for small business. Increasingly, small business competes against brands whose marketing budgets exceed that of the small business total revenue. The only cost-effective means to compete against that is through the authentic messages generated by customers and employees inspired by the connections they experience with a company whose made word-of-mouth central to their business. When you commit to a word-of-mouth strategy, you commit to generating a visceral, emotional, physiological, borderline irrational buy-in from your customers and your employees for your brand. Business-speak, please. , some call it engagement, from your employees means more passion and focus from them. That means greater productivity and efficiency and more solutions, more innovations, more ideas from s small companys brand managers (all of your employees). from your customers means more They trust your brand. Theyll buy more of your brand. The results are quantifiable and immediate. And they start with the most important metric for a small business: Cash is king. Cash is your reward. Positive cash-flows empower you, your colleagues  and your customers to own brand and drive it so it reflects passion. And heres how cash-flows grow with word-of-mouth as your core strategy: Youll save a lot of money when you make your customers and employees your advertising agency. Your investment here is an investment in the long-term sustainability of your company. Its an investment in building loyalty and commitment, connection and community, with your customers and your employees. Traditional advertising too often requires you to invest in your agencys successregardless of the results they deliver for your success. Youll see your sales cycle shorten as you see an increase in referrals from your customers. Shorter sales cycle means theres a shorter length of time between your prospects first contact with you and their first payment to you. Imagine if you could add one week of revenue from each new customer for the past 12 months? Youd do that if you shortened your sales lead time by 7 days. Now, just imagine if you could shorten that byone month! That comes from the increase in your customers as you inspire their . Happy customers look forward to working with you again. Theres no hesitation in their mind. Its a delight to buy from you again. Ok. Sounds good so far, doesnt it. Still there are those who may want details. Hows this work, you ask. What is but the sign of a strong connection with a brand, with the experience of that brand, with the people who create that brand? That experience inspires communication. You cant help it. Word-of-mouth is the result of creating a profound and meaningful connection both with, and your customers and your employees. And its a potential infinite motion machine, a never-ending positive feedback loop, where each party inspires the other. Employees and colleagues are empower to help insure each others successin what? Their job. And their jobs are Your customers then celebrate that experience. How? As birds fly and bees buzz, they do what comes natural: they tell their friends and neighbors, partners and colleagues and even their own customers. These testimonials generate referrals. Those referrals then serve as a reward in themselves for your employees. And one more thingyour customers will voluntarily be the for your employees. Their positive feedback and the referrals they send will be the . The (bad term, agreed) will be their expectations now of nothing less than a experience. Now your customers are a loyal and volunteer sales force for your company, as well as  cheerleaders and management, coaches and innovators, quality-assurance leadersand all for the low, simple price of . You cant hire these many people and still remain profitable. Likwise, your employees empowerment and its accompanying peer pressure serves as its own system of .

They inspire your customers, who inspire their friends, who become your customersyou get inspiredand it starts all over again. Thats when the playing field starts to level. Only a small company can have this kind of communication and connection with their employees and customers. Theres no amount of paid advertising that can generate this kind of word-of-mouth, this system of inspiration sources for a brands success. Thats where the momentum starts to grow. Thats where you get the self-sustaining business model. Thats where you own the brand and you generate the cash to continue to own the brand and deliver it so it reflects your vision, together.

David Slater is a British nature photographer who was attempting to get the perfect shot of a crested black macaque while traveling through Indonesia in 2011. Eventually one of the rather jubilant monkeys decided to hijack the photographers equipment to work on her photography skills. The monkey ended up taking hundreds of grinning self-portraits  which of course went viral on the Internet soon after. about the experience at the time to the Telegraph: Wikipedia then posted the images to its site claiming that since the monkey actually took the shot, she should own copyright and not Slater, thus putting the pictures into the public domain. The images were taken down several times due to Slaters complaints, but ultimately Wikipedia editors have decided to keep them posted. Slater said about the ordeal: Now Wikipedia could be facing a legal battle to keep these hilarious pictures posted. U.S. copyright law can be a grey area and while using the photos for editorial purposes would definitely fall under fair use, according to the law, putting the image into the public domain (and making it available for free use) without the photographers consent is a whole different story. Who do you think should own copyright to the best selfie ever taken: The photographer, the monkey or the public?","Are you blogging for your business?

Theymay soon be able to extend the boundaries of their brick-and-mortar shops with large digital screens  if an eBay test proves viable. Ebay is introducing 24-hour window shops in certain areas of New York City. The window shops are actually touchscreens measuring 9 feet across and 2 feet high. They allow customers to purchase products a physical retail store may not have in stock. They will also be used to allow purchases after store hours. And they can be used in vacant storefronts or other locations, to extend the physical boundaries of brick and mortar retailers. In fact, the test run for the new windows includes four screens in front of closed stores located in busy parts of New York Citys Soho and lower east side. That test run began last week and will continue through July 7, . Ebay partnered with Fifth & Pacific Companies Inc. for the beta run of its new shoppable windows venture. The digital store windows will allow the clothing retailer to launch its new Kate Spade Saturday fashion brand without initially opening additional physical retail stores. This ability for consumers to shop not only online and offline, but also locally and globally, is why eBay Inc. is particularly excited about its latest shopping innovation. With our partners at Kate Spade Saturday, we are launching four 24-hour Window Shops in Manhattan, announced the official eBay blog. Ebay will sell 30 items from the new fashion line via this 24-hour shopping technology, during the test period. The experience is more like shopping at a physical location than shopping online in another way too: immediacy. Purchases are delivered to customers by courier within the hour with payment managed through PayPal Here, a mobile payment service developed by Ebay. Opportunities may be available for other retailers to take part in Ebays new shoppable windows venture once it passes the testing phase. Steve Yankovich, vice president of innovation and new ventures at eBay the best approach for businesses interested in trying the platform is to adopt PayPal technology since thats the method shoppable windows will use to make sales.","If we all know that referrals are the best, most cost-effective marketing strategy, then do we continue to leave referrals up to fate or some happy coincidence? I honestly dont know. In fact, its frustrating to see so many new, ideal, wonderful and profitable clients simply going un-harvested, just because you treated referrals as something that just happen and not like a powerful strategy.

From 1945 to 2005, the number of American businesses grew faster than the population. From the end of World War II until 1980, average revenues and net income at American corporations declined significantly, but have since remained largely constant. Since 1980, net income as a percentage of revenues at American businesses has increased. From 1990 to 2011, business income has declined as a fraction of total income of individual taxpayers. As Figure 1 indicates, from 1945 to 2005 the number of corporation tax returns per capita rose steadily. But then, the period from 2005 to 2010 marked the first five-year decline in the per capita number of corporations since the end of World War II. As Figure 2 shows, the per capita number of all business tax returns  which combine sole proprietorships and partnerships with corporations  grew substantially over the 1980 to 2006 period. Then between 2006 and 2010 the number of business tax returns per thousand people declined slightly for the first time since data have been collected (1980). As Figure 3 shows, average revenue of corporations fell steadily between 1945 and 1980, when measured in inflation adjusted terms. Between 1980 and 2010, however, the average revenue per corporation has remained largely constant in real terms. As Figure 4 shows, net income of the average corporation largely declined between 1945 and 1980 when measured in 2010 dollars. However, between 1980 and 2010, it has been mostly steady. As Figure 5 shows, net income as a fraction of revenues was substantially higher in 2010 (9.5 percent) than in 1980 (6 percent). While the rise is far from linear, and the 2010 numbers are off their 2005 peak, the pattern does appear to be one of rising margins. (The thin black line in the figure indicates the linear trend and the r-squared indicates how well a straight line fits the data.) As Figure 6 shows, business income has declined gradually, and linearly, from 4.1 percent of total income in 1990 to 3.2 percent in 2011. (The narrow black line in the chart shows the trend and the r-squared shows the accuracy of a straight line as a representation of the data pattern.)

Companies like Coca Cola, McDonalds, and Apple have that are popular around the world, but branding isnt just for companies these days. Developing and building your personal brand is an important part of deciding how you want to be known in your workplace, industry and life. Beloware four important steps you can take to start building your personal brandtoday. Each persons reasons for creating a personal brand are different. Start by , whether its snagging better job opportunities, better contacts for a company youre building, recognition in your industry, or a stronger professional network. Once you know what kinds of goals youre pursuing, youll have a better idea how to move forward with building the kind of personal brand you want to create. Ideally, your personal brand should be closely tied to your personal vision for your life. Only you can decide what you want to get out of your life. While your future isnt guaranteed to progress exactly the way you want, the only way to get close to your goals is to know where youre going and why. That said, the purpose of a personal brand isnt to create a character that you feel you have to play for your entire life. Rather, you want to create a platform by which you are able to successfully. To do this, start by identifying your key values and passions. Some common values are family, ambition, community-building and giving. List whats important to you and prioritize each value youve highlighted. Next, look at your passions. What do you love to do? What makes you want to get out of bed and seize the day? What causes are close to your heart? If youre like most people, you have both personal and professional passions. Bringing your passions and values together will help you decide what kind of a person you want to be and help lay the groundwork for your personal brand. For the purposes of your personal brand, you should consider everything about you thats online to be public knowledge. As a result, its a good idea to your social media presence to make sure it lines up with the way you want to present yourself. For example, whenbuilding your personal brand, if youre trying to portray yourself as a professional, corporate go-getter, youll likely want to remove pictures of drunk college parties or expletive-filled rants about sporting events. However, the strict corporate image isnt the only personal brand identity available. If youre looking to brand yourself as a rebel or an innovator, make sure your social media presence is consistent with these images. Think about who you want to be in the world, and bring your online identity in line with it. Here are a few of the social presence elements youll want to consider: The last step in building your personal brand is to find ways to get exposure. And youre in luck  there are plenty of different ways to do this. Outreach is a great place to start. Have a personal website, blog, and social media presence where you share your vision and passion with the world. Reach out to those who share your interests and make friends with influencers who can help share your brand with their followers. You can also make an effort to connect offline. Join professional organizations, attend local business and community events, or meet-up with a recreational sports team in your area. Remember, you cant just sit back and hope your personal brand will get noticed  you need to make it happen. Another way to gain exposure is to earn press coverage. Tim Ferriss, whos built an incredible personal brand over the past decade, has on building local and national press coverage. Yes, all of these activities will take some effort, but the payoff for your brand and the opportunities that result can be incredible. Building your personal brand isnt about pretending to be someone youre not. Its about knowing who you truly are and putting yourself forward in the world as that person. Do this intentionally with an eye towards gaining more opportunities and achieving your overall vision for your life. Itwill help you build the kind of powerful, personal brand that helps you achieve more than you ever thought possible.","As an employer, you may find yourself thinking that you have yet to address health care reform requirements for your business.Some of you may be asking: Well I have an answer  you should take action for your employees. According to the 2013 Aflac WorkForces Report, which sheds light on the attitudes, fears and expectations of workers when it comes to health care reform, employees have concerns about their benefit options and how health care reform may affect those benefits. If you can quell their fears by establishing their benefits options sooner rather than later, you will find your workforce far more at ease about upcoming changes. According to the Aflac study, three-quarters of workers (75 percent) believe health care reform is too complicated to understand. In addition, 72 percent believe their personal health insurance situation will become more complicated once reform takes place. About half (58 percent) of workers think the quality of their health care will improve. Many indicate they believe the new law will affect the scope and cost of their health care coverage, with the majority (83 percent) believing the medical costs they are responsible for will increase. The reality is that many companies already shift a significant share of health care premiums to their workers, and many employers offer health insurance plans with significant deductibles. Yet, only 23 percent of workers are saving money for potential increases in medical expenses and more than half of workers (55 percent) say they are doing nothing to prepare for changes to the health care system. The Aflac study found that more than half of workers (53 percent) think they may not adequately manage their health insurance coverage, leaving their family less protected than they are currently. A similar number (54 percent) would prefer not to have more control over health insurance expenses and options because they will not have the time or knowledge to manage it effectively. These concerns are valid, but as a small business owner, you cannot address them until you make sure that you are well-versed in health care reform. Talk to your broker or agent to get all of the details, but use these provisions (if you own a business with fewer than 50 employees) as a starting point.

Major medical insurers that do not meet new medical loss ratio (MLR) are required to issue rebates to policyholders no later than Aug. 1 following the end of the MLR reporting year (began in 2012). As of Jan. 1, 2013, employer-sponsored cafeteria plans have had to (PDF) employee annual salary reduction contributions to health flexible spending arrangements to $2,500. A 0.9 percent additional Medicare tax went in 2013, raising the Medicare tax rate for certain earners from 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent.

Beginning January 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) restricts waiting to a maximum of 90 days. From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, a temporary reinsurance for the individual insurance market will be funded by a required contribution from all health insurers and group health plans. Health care reform increases the maximum permissible reward under a health-contingent wellness program, meaning individuals who participate in their company wellness programs and meet a specific health can gain larger rewards. Insurers, self-insured employers and other entities that provide minimum essential coverage to an individual during a calendar year must certain health insurance coverage information to the IRS. Certain are also required to report information regarding the health coverage offered to their full-time employees.

Ramon Ray, technologist at , says he believes there is. Today, Ray will help launch Smart Hustle Magazine, a weekly digital publication with a print (yes, as in paper) version coming out quarterly. In a conversation with Small Business Trends, Ray explains: Ray says the new magazine will tell the story of the small business entrepreneurs journey. He tells Small Business Trends: Ray says the digital publication will include a blog updated weekly and also an email edition sent to subscribers telling them about content in the latest edition. The print edition will be sent out to subscribers completely free, says Ray, with the first edition expected in late July or early August. Each publication is expected to contain varioussections. They will include hustle mentor, smart hustle tips, suggested reading and a feature story covering that weeks Smart Hustle person, Ray says. The print edition will contain a slightly different version of the publication. Carolyn Crummey, of will function as Director of Operations for Smart Hustle Magazine. Ray says a key element in creating Smart Hustle Magazine was obtaining the domain name . After trying many other brand names on for size, Ray found the domain name and entered long negotiations with an owner in Sweden to obtain it. Ray explains what makes his publication different from all the others out there:","If your business is structured as a corporation or LLC, youre probably aware that there are certain steps you need to take to keep your business compliant with the state, such as sending in an annual report and paying any fees. Keeping your paperwork and recorded information up to date is another key element to staying compliant. For example, if you changed your business address, authorized more shares or had a board member or director leave, then youll need to notify the state of these changes. This may seem like trivial paperwork, but its actually quite important. Youve got to make sure that your corporation or LLC remains in good standing because if your business happens to be sued, the plaintiff may attempt to show that you have not maintained your LLC/Corporation to the letter of the law. And if successful, your corporate veil is pierced and the plaintiff can seek recovery against your personal assets. As a general rule of thumb, whenever youre changing any of the information included on your original formation paperwork, youll most likely need to notify the state. Here are the most common changes: In most states, the paperwork required to record any changes is called Articles of Amendment (or sometimes Certificates of Amendment). This form takes just a few minutes to complete and is an essential part of keeping your business compliant. You can either file the form directly with your states Secretary of State office or have an online legal document filing service take care of the paperwork for you. States actually dont provide a specific deadline for you to turn in your Articles of Amendment (i.e. you must file within X weeks of making the change). However even without a looming deadline, youll still want to submit any changes as soon as possible, so the state has all your current information on file. If the state information doesnt match what youre actually doing business under, it can hinder you from certain business transactions. For example, you may not be able to renew your business license, open a bank account or create a merchant service account. In addition, as mentioned above, you may be putting your liability protection at risk by not keeping your state files current. For this reason, its always best to keep the state informed of any and all changes as soon as possible.","Running and scaling a business will always be challenging. But having a solid foundation of smoothly operating practices underlying your company can make it much easier. To find out how successful entrepreneurs were building their operations, we asked 13 founders from Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) the following question: Heres what YEC community members had to say: Setting proper team expectations and accountability has become one of the most impactful things to my business. Twice a month we bring all managers and executives together for a big meeting to discuss each department and their accomplishments and challenges. It is also a time for other departments to give feedback to management. At the end of these meetings, everyone leaves with follow-up tasks.~ , Many CEOs, COOs and executive level staff have various methods that they swear are the best ways of doing things. But what many people dont take into account is that there are other variables at work, such as the dynamics of the company and the people within it. Solid operations come from management who can admit when their systems are failing and are willing to change to improve.~ , Having a clear process that every team member understands is extremely important. When a task needs to be completed, there is a clear funnel and order of operations that must be followed. This improves efficiency and reduces the chance of fumbling information and having things slip through the cracks.~ , You have to start at the very base of your business in order to build a successful enterprise from it  and for me that is having a solid core team. I try to look at the first couple of people I hire when assembling a new business as a new family of people that will take me to the next chapter of an awesome life. They need to share my ambition and drive to accomplish.~ , To build a solid set of processes for your business a lot has to align. But the bigger you scale, the more youll likely need to delegate. So how does a business owner stay efficient when the day to day may be further away from the core operations? Its important to gather feedback from your team often to make sure youre addressing inefficiencies and constantly improving as you grow.~ , Yeah, I know its a buzz world. But I truly believe in the power of transparency to build solid operations. Cross-checks, social collaboration tools and breaking down silos are all ways to ensure that each operation is optimal for my unique business needs. Across levels and departments, operations should be communicated, tested and approved.~ , If you are able to provide clear and concise documentation for your team, it leaves very little room for things to be miscommunicated. It also leaves little room for your team to not know what to do or for them to be confused. These are the biggest time wasters in an organization. Documentation makes it easier to onboard new employees and saves your business from being reliant on any one person.~ , Although its important that systems and processes address todays pain points for your business, its much more imperative that they are built to handle changes that could be coming years down the road. You have to look ahead and plan for all plausible changes in your business to ensure the operations youre building do not become quickly outdated.~ , Marcus Lemonis of CNBCs show The Profit always says it, and its on point. Building a solid operation is all about the three Ps: Process, people and product. Build your operation to flow and operate well with that and youll have a successful business.~ , Typically, operations is a complex initiative and involves various stakeholders. Additionally, there are various external conditions impacting outcomes. It is very important to maintain an objective view into how efficient your operations are. And the place to start is data collection. Data driven decision making should not be an afterthought.~ , No one person is going to be be the best at everything. It all comes down to choosing the right person and personality type for each role so that no one is doing tasks that they resent. Forget coaching weaknesses and focus on leveraging strengths and passions. Then watch everything fall into place.~ , Provide the best customer service you can. That is the most important thing you can do. You will at some point have a dissatisfied customer, but how you handle it will give you a solid reputation in your industry.~ Amanda Barbara, Hire someone to own the operation from start to finish. This person should be obsessed with the details, the metrics, the numbers. They should be elated when they hit their goal and inspired to do better when they miss it. They need to eat, sleep and breathe it.~ ,","Your Web content is your portal to your customers.  Its how you will build interest in your business, tell them about yourself, and put them on the right path for whatever your end goal is.  So when youre writing it, what should you be keeping in mind?   How do you make sure your Web content accomplishes everything that you need it to? Here are four things to consider when writing Web content.  Just a little something to get you started. The main goal of your content is to attract your customers.   Thats whose attention and interest youre vying for.  But just because youre on the Web in front of a global audience doesnt mean that EVERYONE has now become your customer.  They havent.  Your customers are only the people in your area who would benefit from the product you sell or the service that you provide.  When you write your content, you want to be creating information that will specifically benefit them.  In order to do that you. The more you can get your content to resemble your audience, the better youll reach them. What is the goal of your Web site? Is it to build interest in a product that youre selling? Is it to become the ultimate resource on lawn care so that when someone needs a landscaper, youre the person they call? Is it to confuse people about the intricacies of search engine optimization so that they just give up and call you when they need help?  However youre defining the goal or conversion point of your site, you want to create content that will put people on that path.    If youre trying to become a resource then youll need to produce lots of beginner and tutorial-type content to help people learn about your subject area.  If youre trying to sell a service then you want to populate your Web site with loads of information about what you do and how youre different from your competitors.  Knowing the goal of the site will help you identify the direction of your content. You dont want to write the search engines, but you do want to keep them in mind, as most of your customers will use a search engine to find you. Theyll type in the keywords theyre interested in and will rely on Google to tell them who is relevant to their query.  That means you want to so that youre coming up for relevant searches.   The search engines will use your keywords to get an idea of what your site is about so that they can display it to users when relevant.  For them to get the right picture, you have to be feeding them with lots of hints by using your keywords in smart ways. Where should you use them? And anywhere else that makes sense on your site! Many times small business owners write their Web content by copying and pasting the print brochures theyve been handing out for years.  On some level, this makes sense. After all, its content and you already have it! However, Web reading habits greatly different from print reading habits and this should be reflected in how you put together your site. Some guidelines for writing Web copy: Keeping your medium in mind will allow you to create content that works for your customer.  It doesnt matter how great or informative your content is if someone landing on your Web site cant great through it. Those are the four biggest considerations I keep in mind when writing site content. What works for you?","According to a (PDF) from the National Employment Law Project, the number of U.S. workers working in temporary jobs has reached an all-time high of 2.8 million people. As the holiday shopping season approaches, your small business might be planning on hiring some temporary workers. But while youre relying heavily on those temps, they may not feel so passionately about your business. In fact, since temporary workers are often lower-paid than other employees, they might be quite disengaged. So how can you motivate temporary employees to get the best results? Beloware some ideas. Because of their generally lower wages, temps are highly motivated by money. Consider holding contests with cash prizes (it doesnt have to be a ton of money) or setting goals for each temp with a bonus to be awarded if the goals are reached by the end of their employment term. You could even offer a bonus for perfect attendance, since absenteeism can be a problem with temporary workers. Temps are often treated like second-class citizens, which isolates and de-motivates them even further. Introduce temps to the rest of your staff and explain what theyll be doing and how long theyll be around. Try pairing a temp with a full-time or permanent worker who can not only train and guide the temp, but also help him or her assimilate into the workplace. (You might want to offer full-time employees a bonus or reward for handling this.) Include temps in social activities such as company lunches or happy hours. Working in teams that include both permanent and temporary workers motivates everyone. Consider holding departmental contests or setting departmental challenges to spur friendly competition and build camaraderie. Offer fun prizes for the winning team. Many temps take temporary jobs in hopes of getting a permanent job offer. When hiring temps, do so with an eye to future growth in your company. Even if you dont have a job to offer the temp, see if you can give him or her a chance to learn new skills. This will help the temp get better jobs in the future and serves as a strong motivator for coming to work each day. Even if a temp comes to you with lots of experience in a certain area, such as point-of-sale retail sales or accounting, he or she doesnt know how your company handles things. Making sure temps get training in your companys systems, rules and philosophy will make them feel part of the team, as opposed to just throwing them in to figure things out for themselves on the first day. You or a manager should also observe the temp at work and offer praise or correct mistakes so the person can get better. Have an especially good temp? Keep his or her contact info on file in case a job opens up. Also send the person away with a reference letter he or she can use when applying for other jobs. Knowing that this job can lead to future possibilities will motivate temporary workers to do their best and make a good impression.","If you didnt get time this week to keep up with the latest, weve got you covered.

Amie Marse shows you how. Is your small business prepared? More severe storms in recent years mean businesses all over the Eastern seaboard must prepare for the worst.

However, the news wasnt all good for small businesses. The study also revealed an area where SMBs continue to struggle [emphasis added]: Interestingly, the same study also found that only 12 percent of small businesses are engaging in social media.  Restated: Only 12 percent of small businesses are taking advantage of a targeted, absolutely free way to market their business online. Sounds silly, right? How about this: Earlier this week, 5,000 influential marketers were sent chocolate covered grasshoppers to snack on and blog about.  The grasshoppers were , tweeted, and linked to all over the Web. It was a viral marketing campaign used to get the company attention and to tell people what was all about.  And in just 24 hours, people learned that it was a phone system company that cared about entrepreneurs.  In one day, thousands of people knew their story. Marketing is storytelling. Stop thinking of social media as Twitter, as blogs, Facebook, MySpace or any of the other sites on the Web. Yes, those are social tools, but social media is about telling your story.  Its you talking directly to your customers and telling them who you are, why youre better and what you believe so that they remember you and feel connected to you.  Its you making them associate something with your company. Those are the stories those companies are telling in social media. Whats yours? Why did you join the marketplace? Who are you? Use social media to tell that story. If youre in the landscaping business, are you the company that cares about being green and using green products? Or are you the company that donates 15 percent of your earnings to buy cars for needy families? Or maybe youre simply the company with the most advanced equipment? Once you have your story spread it. Blog about ways to help the environment by being green and picking a green landscaper. Tell people what to look out for, what products to use, what to avoid, why it all matters, and why you can help them. Use Twitter to promote other green initiatives that compliment what you do.  Find green enthusiasts in your area using an Advanced Twitter Search and reach out to them to form a real relationship. Organize local tweet ups to meet people and encourage them to help spread your message with you and become your evangelists. Not only will they spread your message online, but you can bet theyll spread it offline, as well. Grab your Flip camera and use video to appeal to peoples emotions and bring them in.  Grasshopper.com used and peppy background music to show their adoration of entrepreneurs and theyre dedication to standing by them. They lifted them up to subtly promote themselves. Its the most powerful type of marketing there is. Social media is not Twitter. Social media is you connecting with your customers to tell your story. Its how small businesses can market their companies on the Web, not only effectively, but for free.  Every small business has a unique story. If you want to successfully market and grow your business, focus on telling yours.","The book by Lance Bettencourt has a great quote on innovation: ( ). Okay, I agree, you say, but how do I on those beliefs for a new product? While many books about innovation focus on service or products, few examine the management of development teams and organizations exclusively. Methodical counsel awaits you in by Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble, two faculty professors of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth University. Based on years of research, the authors provide the best practices to proceed on a product or service breakthrough that can satisfy customers and grow your business. I learned about the book through a preview from , so I asked for a review copy. asserts a key premise of balance between ongoing activity and strategic needs. Companies are Performance Engines, entities pressured to deliver profits. A side effect of such pressures, which shape and mold companies as they mature, can be a reduced capacity for accomplishing some innovative projects. When considering a development project, many businesses seek an outside consultant, but adding any kind of agent without specific organizational support typically leads to a failed project. Forget seeking a business messiah for your ingenuity effort  From their research, the authors overall recommend establishing a Dedicated Team with unique practices and metrics, then maintaining a balanced collaborative relationship between the team and various stakeholders from the Performance Engine. The separation is meant to overcome the inertia brought about by a companys focus on daily operations and profit-creating activity. In attempting an innovation program, many companies make one of several mistakes, which can include: More oversights are listed, though the points may feel a little repetitive when taken altogether. Nevertheless, they emphasize the struggle to treat innovation properly throughout a development process. Govindarajan and Trimble offer success stories from well-known corporations, including Timberland, BMW, Nucor and Harley Davidson. Each case shows clear results and takeaways that avoid critical mistakes. The Dow Jones, for example, incorporated a dedicated team with Internet publishing experience, resulting in a 9 percent increase in subscriptions, the biggest one-year jump in a quarter century. Govindarajan and Trimble also emphasize a shared understanding of objectives to develop solutions. A clear hypothesis and recording, covered in the chapter Break Down the Hypothesis, enables that understanding so that efforts remain centered on planning and associated tasks. In short, ensure everyone is one the same page. Better yet, make sure the page is not solely a table or chart. Readers, particularly analytics professionals, will appreciate the authors caution about over-reliance on a spreadsheet to engage other team members. The aforementioned approaches contrast with ideas from companies headed by a definitive passionate leader, such as that suggested in the book ( ). I feel books like speak to companies that do not have that business Neo, that mythical groundbreaker who has the vision. Many businesses face the challenge of arranging a team (and even the Steve Jobses of the world know how difficult it can be), so this book speaks to that moment rather than the romanticized myth of a modern-day Henry Ford or Bill Gates in a fledgling stage. The suggestions may not appear immediately applicable for small business operations or for solopreneurs in the aforementioned fledgling stage. But small businesses and budding firms can still benefit, realizing that a dedicated time and effort to develop new methods is essential and that similar pitfalls can happen. The authors tips on identifying stakeholders and establishing a planning process can be re-imagined when working with remote team members or groups in a temporary setting. An assessment tool table and common innovation myths bring a thoughtful closure to the book. Seth Godin once commented that to be a great client you must realize If you read , your odds of accommodating your new methods to service customers better and ultimately improve profitability will be much greater.","Has this ever happened to you? Youre sitting there, thinking about nothing and out of nowhere you get this amazing idea. Youre excited about this idea and the possibility that it holds for your business. While youre in the flow, you start putting a plan in place to make it happen and then BOOM, an email shows up from a potential client who needs exactly what youve been thinking about! That is the Law of Attraction at work. The Law of Attraction states that which is like unto itself, is drawn. When you say, Birds of a feather flock together, you are actually talking about theLaw of Attraction. When you see that people who are always talking about illness and sickness are often sick, youre actually seeing the Law of Attraction. When youre thinking about someone and they call or email you  youre experiencing the Law of Attraction. As human beings, we are highly electrically charged biological entities and the thoughts we think emitfrom us into our immediate environment and through the Law of Attraction, start attracting similar thoughts, people, opportunities and experiences right back to us like a beacon. In the same way that you cant escape the Law of Gravity  you cant escape the Law of Attraction. So you might as well use it to your advantage. There are those folks who think that the Law of Attraction has no place in business, that its #WooWoo stuff for people who would rather about being successful than do what it takes to be successful. This is a fallacy. The Law of Attraction is just like the Law of Gravity. You dont need to believe in it to be affected by it. And you (as well as your business) are experiencing the Law of Attraction whether by design or by default. What Id like to show you today is how to leverage the Law of Attraction and use it to create and design the business of your dreams. And believe me, this has very little to do with and has everything to do with . Lets say that youre throwing a party and youre going to invite some friends. Do you send them the alphabet? Of course not! You send them an invitation that clearly states what the party is for, what dates its on and what time it starts and ends. You also give them your address and maybe even directions about what to bring or wear. You are clear and people respond. You are working inside the Law of Attraction. If youve ever wondered why every marketing plan and every business plan has a vision and mission statement  this is the reason. You have to be clear about the outcome and the purpose for your actions. Thats how the Law of Attraction works. Be exceptionally clear about what you want and what you dont want. Focus your thoughts, feelings and actions on exactly what you want. Be specific about what it looks like when its achieved and how it will make you feel having reached that goal. And the Law of Attraction will bring these outcomes to you. When my son was about six years old, I was dropping him off at school and I could see that he was having a bad day. I knew the Law of Attraction and I knew that if he went to school with this kind of attitude, it would not be a good day. Hey, I said. Happy Face, Happy Day! If you go in there with a frowny face, youre going to get frowns back. But if you go in there with a happy face, youll get smiles back. Go give it a try. He agreed, and when he came home smiling, I already knew that it had worked. If force (such as throwing a ball into the air) is the driver of the Law of Gravity, feelings/emotions are the driver of the Law of Attraction. Imagine your feelings, thoughts and beliefs as something you throw into the world and at other people. What goes up, must come down, right? What you throw out there is what youll get back. If you are feeling excited, happy and enthused about the products and services that you sell, your customers will feel the same way and more of them will come out of the woodwork to get that same experience. The final step is the hardest for entrepreneurs and is probably the one everyone calls wishful thinking. Instead of calling it wishful thinking, consider it more like allowing. Let me be clear. Allowing doesnt mean sitting back and doing nothing. Allowing means deciding on who you will be in a given circumstance. You then take actions that are consistent with that way of being, and, as a result, experience the outcome you desire. Here is a real example that all of us deal with. One minute youre having a great day and the next minute you get a customer complaint email. You go from being happy to being frustrated, angry and sad. In that moment, you let the customer complaint determine who you are . If you do that, your next response might be defensive or argumentative. But if you decide that who you are in your business is helpful, the complaint is transformed into a communication from your customer, who is clearly requesting some kind of help. And if you respond by being helpful, that person will be so blown away, they will refer you to 10 of his or her friends. BOOM! Law of Attraction at work. There are three powerful questions that every successful brand has answered. This is not metaphysical, this is marketing rooted in the Law of Attraction, and it works. After you read these, youll see them expressed in every powerful and successful business and brand you see. When you think about answering this question, think about the values and beliefs that your business is founded on. In Jeanne Bliss book  , Bliss talks about five basic decisions beloved companies make. You can decide to be trusting, funny, enthusiastic, detail oriented, helpful, smart  the possibilities are endless. This is the clear outcome you are after for yourself and your customers. Be careful not to that you are committed to one thing, but then take that show youre committed to something else entirely different. For example, dont say youre committed to healthy eating and then turn around and binge out on doughnuts. Words and actions must align. This is your brand promise. What is it that your customers love about you? What do they know they can get from you? What do you do that brings them joy? One great thing about the Law of Attraction and how it applies to business is that its always at work. If you follow the principles Ive outlined here, youll have a lot more fun creating the business of your dreams.","On Monday, March 30, BlackBerry the new will be open for .

The author makes the most of 182 pages through sociological critique of internet culture through his noted ability to debate and offer critical thought. I received a free copy of this book from a Search Engine Strategies expo during his presentation there a year ago, so I figured to give this small book a big whirl of a review.","A few weeks ago, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) admitted that some of its employees improperly subjected to disproportionate scrutiny to conservative groups seeking to set up non-profit status. While you might think that the scandal has little to do with small business, in the strange world of Washington  where everything influences everything else  the scandal has the potential to benefit small business owners in several ways. The biggest potential gain for small business owners lies in the ammunition the scandal provides Republicans in their effort to challenge the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  While the GOP has thus far failed to stop the new health care law, the scandal gives Republicans the opportunity to hinder the tax agencys efforts to enforce the law.  By hammering away at the theme that the IRS cannot be trusted, the GOP may be able deny the tax authority the funds it needs to administer the new law. That, it turns out, will benefit small business owners, who tend to oppose the ACA. conducted in April revealed that 48 percent think the new law will be bad for business, while only 9 percent think it will be good, and 39 percent think it will have no impact. The cost of the new law, and the benefits of any reduced enforceability, will fall largely on small businesses because almost all big companies provide employee health insurance.  In 2012, the Kaiser Family Foundation that 98 percent of businesses with 200 or more employees offered employee health insurance, but only 61 percent of companies with fewer than 200 employees did. The scandal also adds to the credibility of the Tea Party groups, who are major supporters of small business.   Conservative organizations claimed months ago that they had been singled out for unfair treatment, but many were skeptical of their claims.  Being the victim of the IRS has boosted the favorability of the Tea Party movement, a CNN/ORC International survey .  Between the March poll (before the news of the scandal broke) and the latest poll, the Tea Partys favorability increased nine percentage points, CNN reports. If the Tea Party can capitalize on the scandal to garner support in the mid-term elections, their electoral success should work to the advantage of small business owners.  Tea Party supporters are more likely than other voters to believe that cutting taxes on small business is a good approach to job creation, a 2010 Winston Group survey .  Moreover, nearly two-thirds of small business owners believe in the Tea Party idea that the government is too expansive, as compared to less than half of all Americans, A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll showed. Then theres the effect of the scandal on IRS audits themselves.  The tax agency might need to cut back on audits in the wake of the scandal, as it seeks to rebuild its trust with the American people.  That would be a welcome respite for successful small business owners who have seen an increase in the rate of IRS examinations in recent years.  According to the IRSs annual , the audit rate for business returns of between $200,000 and $1 million jumped from 2.8 percent in 2008 to 3.7 percent in 2012. Perhaps a corollary of the proposition that politics makes strange bedfellows should be: politics creates unexpected linkages.","Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Business to Business commerce, as the name suggests, is a transaction between two business entities for bulk purchase/sell.

Both fields are built on utilizing data to make decisions in order to improve processes and optimize ROI (return on investment). However, for many companies, business intelligence continues to be an elusive concept that never quite finds its way to the top of the priority list. In my experience, once you learn how synergistic these two disciplines can be, it makes sense to prioritize their integration. From advertising to audience research, below are five great ways that business intelligence and online marketing can work together. Providing comprehensive target audience data across offline and online platforms can help campaigns be more targeted. Business intelligence allows companies to craft their ideal audience behavior patterns across multiple forms of media  including television, radio, print and online. This type of research often translates into a starting point for building an online advertising campaign. Along the same lines, online advertising can usually generate faster results reports because they are commonly based on impressions, clicks and online purchases. Instant data can benefit offline advertising campaigns by offering an initial glimpse into the effectiveness of a seasonal campaign, branding colors or new product ads. Business intelligence firms already offer real-time analytics based on online marketing efforts, so it makes sense for Web analytics to have more a presence here. Both social media and search engine marketing campaigns can benefit from the structured analysis that business intelligence experts are already using. Search engine marketing is slowly becoming more of an analytical position, as many analytics platforms (like Google Analytics) now provide a large depth of data that includes basic demographics as well as user search behavior. For instance, if 90% of all American visitors to your website go to a specific product or services page, then it would make sense to further develop marketing and advertising for that product in the United States. A highlights that slow shift in emphasis in data analysis for many available search engine marketing positions. By placing a bigger emphasis on the data behind online marketing campaigns, traditional business intelligence reports can translate how online marketing efforts are (positively or negatively) affecting the bottom line. Additionally, social media engagement data is a great way to get a good glimpse at the overall demographics (age, gender, location) of users that are engaging most with the company online. The raw data from social media is definitely overwhelming at first. Fortunately, key metrics and formulas that business intelligence analyzers normally use can help filter and make sense of the key information social media can provide. Besides demographic data (IQ), social media also provides emotional pattern data, as social media comments and behavior is an indicator of brand sentiment. This can help businesses see how their customers feel about their brand, as its not always about the numbers. When offline events are promoted online, it can give good insight into overall customer patterns, thus helping to increase event marketing effectiveness. By learning the time, location and ways that customers interact with event ticketing, event planners can learn when the best time is to promote events, what types of events do well and adjust ticket prices optimize sales. A proper online event marketing campaign can track a customers interaction from start to finish. This includes tracking how they found out about the event through metrics such as entrance pages, referral sites and custom promo codes. The chance to combine real world events and promotions with online marketing campaigns is one of the best ways business intelligence and online marketing can work together. If big data from business intelligence is giving online marketers a good idea of their target audience, then marketers can understand what type of online content results in the most traffic and conversions.

Its great for SEO (search engine optimization), because search engines love websites with a steady stream of fresh, quality content. Its great for engagement because visitors enjoy looking forward to new articles, resources and information on a regular basis. Youll find all sorts of advice out there on this topic. Some experts advocate quality over quantity, and say you can post to your blog once a week, or even once a month, as long as its consistently high-quality material  long, well-written posts with authoritative links and statistics and research. Others adhere to the idea that its imperative to update your blog every day, even if you just throw up a dashed-off post that consists of a link and a few sentences of commentary. Frequent posting, they say, drives search engines more impressively than quality. Whats the magic number for updating your blog that will give you the right balance between quality and quantity, keeping both search engines and visitors happy and returning to you again and again? The unfortunate truth is theres no magic number. But there are some updating frequencies that are better than others, and there is a right number of posts per week for you and your particular small business. Even if you have the most amazing quality blog posts ever written, if youre not updating at least once a week, youre losing momentum. Search engines crawl your website less often. Visitors and potential customers forget that your blog exists. If your updates are more than a week apart, its about as effective as not blogging at all. While its true that daily content can give your small business blog a great boost, its equally true that a sudden drop in publishing frequency can damage your efforts. Burnout can be a serious problem for bloggers. If youre trying to write fresh content every single day, youre probably on a fast track to running out of steam. Unless you have someone whose only job is to write daily blog posts, or youre planning to supplement original content with guest posts, reprints and material, you dont have to write fresh. A daily post schedule probably isnt the best choice for your small business blog. After all, youve got a business to run. When you have a regularly updated and engaging blog, youre positioned for more website traffic and increased lead generation. According to recent from marketing company Hubspot: Consistency is the most important aspect of small business blogging. Once you have a regular schedule, your visitors will know to expect new material at those intervals. Theyll come back to look for your latest post. Search engines also give higher preference to regularly updated websites over those that update sporadically or infrequently. For most small businesses, updating your blog one to three times per week is a realistic and effective schedule. Make your blog updates a priority, continue to provide quality posts and resources, and youll see returns in the form of more traffic and increased sales through your small business website.","Recently, Google announced that it would in favor of its new, shiny platform. Wallet is designed both for online payments, the way Checkout was, as well as mobile payments at select retailers. Note that I said select. Right now Googles focus seems to be big box stores. When I searched for in my area of San Diego, stores like New York & Company, Best Buy, Footlocker and 7 Eleven popped up. Its unfortunate, because I think this could be a fantastic tool for small businesses. Anything that makes it easier for customers to pay businesses is usually good news for small biz, but the process of signing up as a retailer to accept Wallet is more daunting than the typical DIY approach of Google. The is geared much more toward national retailers than small businesses: Its unclear how much of an up-front investment is required. Online, the integration is as easy as it was with Checkout: just like with Paypal, you insert some code on your site or use Wallets integrated services to let customers pay through Wallet. Fees for the service vary, depending on how much revenue you bring in. For online and off, if you bring in under $3,000 a month or less, the fee is 2.9% + $.30 per transaction (competitive with Paypal). For transactions of $3,000 to $9,999, the fee drops slightly to 2.5%+ $.30, and so on. Never heard of Google Checkout? Yourenot alone as it has . how much more successful will Google be by offering mobile payments, especially when so few retailers offer it? And for that matter, are we in the United States even ready for mobile payments? Weve been salivating over how successful mobile payments have been in and Europe, but theres still an awkward disconnect among users, the phones offering the applications, and retailers actually accepting mobile payments, not to mention how the banks feel about losing transaction fees to smaller players in the mobile payment space. Paypal has thrown its own hat in the ring with services, but again, were simply not seeing widespread adoption. Currently, only the SprintNexus-S 4G phones have the Wallet app, so well be waiting a while before more popular phones carry the feature. This alone tells me growth of this service will be very slow, as customers wont buy a specific phone just to be able to use Googles Wallet app. If you use Google Checkout to collect payments online, you dont need to do anything immediately, though you will be asked to update the logo to the new Wallet version soon. Youll be able to log into your account with the same credentials as you did with Checkout. If youre wondering if you should invest in a point-of-sale system to start , my thought is that its not imperative at this point (although if youre in the San Francisco area, I bet youd be in good company, as theyre always early adopters to Google technology). Its not clear whether the equipment youd need to get started is typically free, but the Wallet site for merchants states thatGoogle has partnered with to offer a special Mobile Starter package, which includes up to $100 of free processing and a free contactless PIN Pad to accept payments. Id love to see Google push this product toward small businesses. It would give smaller players the opportunity to connect with customers in new ways.","Theyre coming.

[ ]","Back in May we told you about Google Business Photos, an effort by Google to pair small business owners up with professional photographers to take high-quality images of their business for their Google Places profile. At the time the program was only available in select cities so we encouraged SMBs and to take their own photos. Today we tell you that if you didnt listen to us, youre in luck because Google just . So if you do want a professional photographer to come take photos of your business, heres your chance. Because of the success of the original pilot, Google has created a new Web site so that small business owners can find a trust photographer in their area. SMBs can by finding a photographer from Googles list and then both parties work out a time and price on their own. Within days your photos will then be available on Googles properties. Google has essentially taken itself out of the equation and is now playing match-matcher between SMBs and photographers. A few things worth noting about the program: In its FAQ, Google does disclose that these photos may be used outside of just your Google Places profile, including possible Google Maps integration. By allowing a Google trusted photographer to take your business photos, you license the photos to Google to use. This probably isnt an issue for most SMBs who want their photos out there, but something to keep in mind for certain businesses. If you want full rights to your pictures, you may want to hire your own photographer and not go through Google. Something else to keep in mind is you wont have the ability to review the photos before they go live on your Google Place page. Again, from the Google FAQ: However, if you find a major issue, you can ask Google to blur some areas of the panoramic images. You can also ask to have all panoramas removed, but theyre unable to take down individual ones, which may be a bummer. Months after our original post, I still think small business owners are better off finding their own photographer rather than looping Google into the process. By doing your own legwork you can potentially find a photographer you can barter services with (allowing you to get the photos for free) and you get full control over how many photos are taken, which are used, and how theyre used. Maybe Im just paranoid but I dont see the value of bringing Google into the equation. However, if youre interested, Trusted Photographers is currently available in 14 US cities (Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, San Francisco/Bay Area, Seattle and Washington, DC.), as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and France. Happy photo taking.","Finding a partner who wants to play ball with you seems like a difficult task, but when you take a look at the process, its negotiating the terms of a partnership agreement that requires true business savvy. Like Ben Hogans legendary golf swing, follow-through is the key, consistent element to make sure the terms of partnership are mutually beneficial. Do yourself a favor  dont leave it all up to the lawyers. Partnerships are about a shared vision, so make sure business comes first and foremost. The key to any good business relationship is understanding individual and shared goals. We all want to make money, but when you share the cost of the service provided to customers, there are expectations and split revenues. Leverage what your company can do for their business goals and vice versa. Before any lawyers get involved make sure you talk about business goals openly. How will revenue be shared? What does the end product look like? Does one company have to significantly customize a service they already provide? Is distribution involved? If the partnership falls through, will one company be compensated for the work its already delivered? Answering these questions on a business level first will help get the partnership off the ground before legal teams can weigh down the agreement. Dont get me wrong, lawyers are great, but they focus on the details, which can rabbit hole partnerships quickly. Getting the business goals in writing can help make sure you enter the legal phase of creating a contract with a solid, mutually understood business case. Since getting a large company to agree to anything in writing can be hard, having a summary written in an email is often a good solution  and something that you can get them to agree to prior to getting the lawyers involved. Within any partnership, there are distribution commitments. This might mean physically delivering a product, or it could be distributing a message. Whether on the content or distribution end of a partnership, be very clear about the work that is expected upon delivery and your companys role in getting it there. Define roles precisely so they have no messy gray area. Make sure the exact product is explained and the infrastructure to support and update that product is part of this definition. Its important to be thorough at this stage, so be sure to cover breach of contract and termination agreements. Basically, if doom and gloom takes over, you want to ensure you have leverage and wiggle room. Make sure your company has enough pull written into the contract to enforce a breach of contract, should it happen. Also, define clean terms (and even metrics) that give your company the opportunity leave the partnership without a devastating penalty if it doesnt work out. When the drafts of the contracts are going to be exchanged youll need an experienced lawyer. Dont make the mistake of trying to draft a complicated, legally binding agreement between a big company and yours without counsel. Big companies have a sophisticated in-house contracting attorney; you need one too. Ive spoken with entrepreneurs who thought they were saving money by not using an attorney on their first partnership contracts, only to later realize they gave away a lot of their intellectual property to the big company! When considering who to hire, let experience be your guide. Essentially, this means that the larger, the more complex an agreement is, the more experience you will need from your counsel. Ive had great luck using a quick online search to find startups who have partnerships with the company Im negotiating with  and then using LinkedIn to ping the startups CEOs and ask for recommendations on the counsel they used. One area where youll need your counsels advice is negotiating the protective provisions. These are designed to protect the larger partner, in the case that the smaller gets sold. Make sure the large partner does not have a chance to either block or disrupt the sale of your company  as unlikely of a move as this might be. Also, make sure these provisions cannot slow or block funding, particularly if your company is venture backed. Many times the larger company will ask for more than it should. Your lawyers job and reputation is based on negotiating for you, knocking the larger partner back in line with an agreement that is more standard. Your lawyer will also help you out with intellectual property. Sometimes in partnerships, something called IP taint happens  where one partner lays claim to own the IP of the other. Make sure that your company retains full ownership of any IP, even if a customization is involved in the process. Make sure these bases are covered before your partnership officially launches. Once the hardball is out of the way, its time to be a good partner  which brings me back to Ben Hogans golf swing. To become known as the best striker in the game, Hogan had his tips, tricks and secrets, but he also had his very obvious follow-through, which basically comes down to routine and effort. To be a great partner, meet your responsibilities consistently and dont be afraid to append your agreement if it requires some tweaking.","is known for the big brands that are using it to get eCommerce sites up and running quickly.Clients include Gibson Guitar, YETI Coolers and many others. But the company says that Bigcommerce isnt exclusively for major national brands. Small businesses can and should be taking advantage of what the eCommerce platform can offer. In an interview with Small Business Trends, Bigcommerce CPO Westley Stringfellow said: If your business is in the market for an eCommerce platform, Bigcommerce appears to be a powerful option to consider. Having your own store online can help you to build your brand and break free from other services like eBay or Amazon. Stringfellow says: Bigcommerce users have access to dozens of store design templates, many of them free, as well as hundreds of apps to help you manage your store. Many of these apps are also free. Stores on Bigcommerce range between about $25 per month to about $150 monthly. More expensive tiers allow you more storage, up to 30 GB of space, and more product listings. The basic plan (known as Bronze on Bigcommerce) allows you to list 100 products at one time. No matter what plan you choose through Bigcommerce, there are no transaction fees tacked on to any of your sales.Bigcommerce is relatively easy to use and can get your eCommerce presence online in less than an hour. Once youve chosen one of the templates, youll be able to integrate different apps with your new store. That includes apps like eBay and Amazon. When you use these apps, you can sync your inventory with products you have listed on those sites. Other apps allow you to integrate accounting software and even several apps that let you interact with visitors to your site in real time. Bigcommerce is also integrated with more than 60 payment providers, including PayPal, Stripe, and others. Stringfellow tells us that about 30 apps have a one-click install feature. He says: Small businesses are finding their experience with Bigcommerce enjoyable, too. Adam Teague, a founder of , said in an email to Small Business Trends:","The key reason to form an LLC (limited liability company) is to shield the personal assets of the owners from that of the business. This means that if your company has bad debts or is sued, banks and other lenders cannot seize your personal property. But lets face it. For many small business owners, questions about forming an LLC typically boil down to a single topic  taxes. Whether its driven by a desire to escape self-employment taxes or looking to avoid that double taxation whammy, small business owners ponder which legal structure is right for their business and financial situation. The LLC is often associated with pass-through taxation, meaning the LLC itself does not pay taxes. Rather, income from the business is passed to the companys owners (aka members) who then claim these profits on their personal tax forms. However, the LLC actually offers flexibility when it comes to . This is because the LLC is an entity created by state statute. The IRS allows the LLC to be taxed as a corporation, partnership or sole proprietor, depending on elections made by the LLC and the number of members. Under federal law, an LLC is classified as one of these types of taxable entities: In this case, youre the sole owner of the LLC and you report business income on your Schedule C tax form, as well as pay self-employment tax on the profit on the Schedule SE form. This is whats typically called pass-through taxation, as the LLC does not need to file any tax forms. You will only need to pay self-employment taxes if you are engaged in an active trade or business; for example, if you provide a service to clients or sell a product. If you formed an LLC for a passive activity, like real estate investments, you will not have to pay self-employment tax on the profits (and in that case, youd report your passive profits on Schedule E). For example, Anne is a wedding photographer and formed an LLC for her business. The LLC earned $42,000 in profit this year. She will pay taxes on this $42,000 at her individual tax rate, as well as pay self-employment taxes (currently 13.3 percent for the calendar year 2011 for the first $106,800). With this arrangement, there are multiple members who own the LLC as partners. Unlike the single-member LLC described above, in this case, the multiple-member LLC reports its business income on a separate 1065 partnership tax return. Then, each partner pays self-employment taxes on their share of the partnership profit on the Schedule SE tax form. As with the single-member LLC, self-employment taxes only need to be paid if the LLC engages in an active trade or business. An LLC can elect to be treated as a corporation for tax purposes by filing Form 8832 with the IRS. In this case, the LLC files a corporate tax return 1120. And the LLC profits are not subject to self-employment taxes. However, if the LLC profits are distributed to LLC owners in the form of dividends, those dividends are taxed again at the 15 percent qualifying dividend rate. The LLC treated as a C corporation is also responsible for payroll taxes on any wages paid to LLC members who work in the business. For example, Paul owns a consulting company which earned $80,000 in profit. As a C corporation, the business would pay $27,200 in taxes on this income (assuming a 34 perent tax rate). If Paul then takes home that profit as a dividend, he would also owe taxes (at the 15 percent qualifying dividend rate) on the dividend payment. In this case, the LLC elects to be treated as an S corporation. The S corp files an 1120S tax return, but the companys profits are not subject to corporate income tax (like they are in the C corporation). Instead, individual LLC owners are taxed on their respective shares of the companys profits (and profits are not subject to self-employment tax). If an LLC owner works in the business, they must be paid a reasonable wage for their activities and the LLC must pay payroll taxes on these wages. Lets say three sisters started an organic ice cream business and each own one-third of the business. They form an LLC and elect to be taxed as an S corporation. In the first year, their business earns $90,000 in profit. The ice cream business does not pay income tax on the profit. Instead, each sister includes her share of the profit ($30,000) in her taxable income on her individual tax return. And if their business lost $45,000 in the first year, each sister would include a $15,000 loss in her individual taxable income. Choosing the right tax entity for your LLC is a weighty issue and will ultimately depend on all the unique aspects of your particular business needs, vision and circumstances. Investigate your options and stay on top of changing tax developments on both the federal and state levels that could affect your taxes. Most importantly, know that the LLC is great for small business owners who want liability protection, but would prefer minimal formality (and paperwork). Its also a perfect structure for a business with foreign owners, as anyone (C corp, S corp, another LLC, trust or estate) can be an owner of an LLC. So take some time and educate yourself on the benefits of forming an LLC and what tax treatment is best for you. After all, both you and your business are worth it.","Wix is hoping to hit the high note with independent musicians on its latest offering. Saying that indie musicians are under-served in being provided a competent Web platform to share and sell their music, Wix has introduced WixMusic. This new specialty platform allows musicians to upload their recorded music directly to their new Wix site and sell it immediately. Wix says it has created targeted at musicians. And because mobile devices are often used to stream music, the new WixMusic sites are optimized for those devices, too. Wix hopes the new platform will appeal to independent bands, DJs, music producers, studios, singers, songwriters and musicians. In  an official announcement of the new platform March 31, Wix Co-Founder and CEO Avishai Abrahami, says: And perhaps most important to indie musicians, Wix takes no commission on the sale of their music. Check out the Wix video introducing the service, highlighting how one band takes advantage of WixMusic: Add this to an array of services already by Wix, best known for its drag-and-drop Web construction platform. Thousands of businesses have taken advantage of Wixs relatively easy-to-use site building app to create a ready-to-go eCommerce platform, the company says. Now, that can include musicians with WixMusic. Thats not to say that musicians should pull a Taylor Swift and yank their music off other popular, albeit crowded, streaming services, but having a ready-made eCommerce site allows musicians to grow their brand and build their own identity. The WixMusic platform also allows musicians and bands to market themselves as a brand, too. The platform allows groups to sell their own branded merchandise. Bands using new platform can also create an email newsletter to stay in contact with their fans. Wix includes tracking and metrics that musicians can use to monitor their sites successes or shortcomings. That includes determining how recipients of an email newsletter responded to it. This new platform will be gradually introduced, according to a Wix statement, and eventually available to all users soon.","Kena Betancur/Getty The University of Michigan will release its preliminary report on consumer sentiment during July at 10 a.m. ET.

Earlier this year, Apple filed a patent for a technology that would allow secured storage of sensitive financial data on a smartphones hardware. At the same time, the technology would allow a transaction to be completed via Near Field Communication (NFC) and Bluetooth, . So this makes it feasible for financial transactions to be completed via smartphone. Another patent would track the location and context of each transaction  for example what store a purchase is made in and at what time or on what day. This is so a customer can take advantage of applicable rewards points or coupons, AppleInsider. The company has also been in involved talks with payment companies recently, another indication that Apple may be developing its own mobile payment system. The company has also been hiring recently to help build a business around the millions of credit cards it already has on file. For any business accepting digital payments, a payment platform on the new iPhone 6 would mean yet another means for customers to pay for goods and services.","They say that most business people know that half of their marketing dollars are wastedthey just dont know which half.  Well, a recent study by shows just how true that statement may be in the world of social media.  Over they commented on a September MarketingProfs study that took a look at what tactics have been proven successful for social media vs. what companies are actually doing in the space. Surprisingly (or perhaps not) the tactics werent the same. The study looked at both Facebook and Twitter in order to determine whats working for social media marketers.  On Facebook, the study found that the most common marketing tactic being used was to drive people toward promotional material via the Facebook status update. Sounds good, however, the study reported the tactic only garners a 25 percent success rate for B2Bs and a 28.4 success rate for B2Cs. The most successful Facebook marketing tactic was to create branded Facebook applications, though only 25 percent of companies admitted to doing so. Other common successful Facebook marketing tactics included: Things looked pretty similar when the survey moved to Twitter marketing tactics. Once again, driving traffic by linking to marketing and promotional materials was the most common activity reported, but it wasnt necessarily deemed the most effective.  According to the survey, the most effective way to do business on Twitter is to use it as a real-time PR device. The most successful Twitter marketing strategies included: Overall, the study highlights a pressing need for SMBs owner to track their social media efforts and focus on the activities that are going to yield them the highest ROI.  Over the past 18 months, many SMBs owner have been jumping into social media to experiment and try things out.

This includes realistic goal setting, organization, communication, execution, and keeping track of metrics. In the past, there were limited tools and resources to aid in a marketing campaign. These tools were primitive and many lacked efficiency.Fortunately, cloud apps have changed the marketing landscape and are ideal for business owners looking to streamline their marketing campaigns and their progress.

Even if your computer has a meltdown, all data from your marketing campaign could easily be retrieved online. In an uncertain world where theres always the potential for curveballs and human error, cloud apps offer marketers a peace of mind that critical data will never be lost. Its also relatively secure because the cloud can only be accessed by authorized individuals with the username and password. If youre coordinating multiple people into your marketing campaigns, its important that everyone can quickly access the information they need. For instance, one person may be in charge of SEO, another in charge of social media and another responsible for email marketing. Using a cloud app allows each person to log in and work on whichever aspect of the campaign they need to from any location that has Internet access. This means that a small business can efficiently run its marketing campaign with employees across the country or even the world. Since many cloud apps are also available on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, this allows employees to complete tasks while theyre on the road and increase productivity.

Since many cloud apps are inexpensive or even free, theyre a great solution for staying on track without breaking the bank. Many cloud providers also operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, so theres no need for long contracts and obligations. Besides this, updates and upgrades are usually part of the package, so theres no need to pay additional fees.

To justify the need for this program, several authors have argued that immigrants are more likely to become high tech entrepreneurs than people born in the United States. For example, in his BusinessWeek column, I published a research report back in 2006 showing that over 50 percent of Silicon Valley engineering and technology startups were founded by immigrants (as were 25 percent of such startups nationwide), I concluded that immigrants were more likely to be entrepreneurs. Recently I took a look at what data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (which collects data on the entire U.S. labor force) show about the odds that immigrants and non-immigrants become the self-employed heads of incorporated businesses. (I focused on incorporated self-employment because it is a better representation of business formation than unincorporated self-employment.) Following the standard practice of defining high tech as those industries with above average (or above the median) research and development (R&D) spending, I identified the following industries as high tech, using the 2010 Science and Engineering Indicators from the National Science Foundation:  Internet publishing and broadcasting  Publishing industries (except internet)  Internet service providers and data processing services  Professional and technical services  Computer and electronic products  Chemical manufacturing  Health care services (except hospitals)  Motion picture and sound recording industries  Management of companies and enterprises  Machinery manufacturing Counter to the frequently made argument, the data dont show that immigrants are more likely to become high tech entrepreneurs. True, in 2009 in six industries with above average R&D intensity (Internet publishing and broadcasting, publishing industries except the Internet, chemical manufacturing, machinery manufacturing, health care services except hospitals, motion picture and sound recording), immigrants were more prone to becoming incorporated self-employed than people born in the U.S. But in four high tech industries (computer and electronic products, Internet service providers and database services, professional and technical services, and the management of companies and enterprises), the native born were more likely than the foreign born to be the self-employed head of a corporation. Even if we just concentrate on a subset of high tech industries  those that relate to computers  theres no clear pattern in favor of immigrants or the native born. Immigrants have greater odds of running an incorporated business in Internet publishing and broadcasting, but not in Internet service providers, data processing services or computer and electronic products. Moreover, the gaps between the groups are large. The native born are 6.6 percentage points more likely than immigrants to be the self-employed head of an incorporated Internet service provider or data processing service, but 4.7 percentage points less likely to run their own incorporated Internet publishing and broadcasting business. Theres no evidence of the supposed greater odds of high tech entrepreneurship among immigrants if we substitute unincorporated self-employment for incorporated self-employment. Using this alternative measure, three of the industries (chemical manufacturing, management of companies and enterprises, and machinery manufacturing) in which immigrants were more likely to run their own incorporated businesses now show no difference between immigrants and those born here. Three of the industries (the publishing industry except Internet, Internet publishing and broadcasting, and motion picture and sound recording studios) where immigrants were more likely to run their own incorporated businesses show lower rates of unincorporated self-employment than those born here. Only in the computer and electronic product industry did the native born have a higher rate of incorporated self-employment but a lower rate of unincorporated self-employment. A final point concerns the stability of these patterns over time. In 2008, the native born incorporated self-employment rate in machinery manufacturing was 2.3 percent, versus 1.6 percent for those born outside the U.S. But in 2009, the numbers were 2.8 percent for those born in the U.S. and 3.9 percent for those born elsewhere. In chemical manufacturing, the 2008 rates were 1.4 percent for the American-born and 1.0 percent for immigrants. But in 2009, the numbers were 1.2 percent for those born in the U.S. and 1.5 for those born outside the country. (We cant say much about changes in the information-based industries because the definitions were changed between 2008 and 2009). In short, the data dont support the assertion that immigrants have greater odds of becoming high tech entrepreneurs  at least not in the United States.","Mike Nudelman/Business Insider Elon Musk. 1.

And this week the social media site says it tweaked Graph Search and rolled it out to all U.S. Facebook users. The extent to which Graph Search will benefit businesses, however, remains to be seen. Back in January some observers were underwhelmed and/or put off by invasion of privacy implications. Techcrunchs Natasha Lomas pronounced Graph Search  . Sam Biddle at Gizmodo pointed out how individuals may they might not want the world to know. And while I havent revealed anything on my personal Facebook profile or business Pages that I dont want the world to know, some others have. For instance, Iwas shocked to discover almost 10  people Ive never heard of claiming to work for Small Business Trends! Thats something I learned by searching on our trademarked brand name. See screenshot above of the employees I never knew we had. Aside from that little tidbit  which I still am not sure what to do about  its hard for me to see how Graph Search will be of much value to my business. But there is one type of business I can see immediately getting some value from Graph Search: local businesses. Let me give you a quick look of what Graph Search can do for your business (or not). The first thing you should know about Graph Search is that users may still have to activate it if they havent used it yet. Luckily thats a simple process. Go to the . Scroll down until you see the large button that says Try Graph Search and click on that. If youre not able to click on that button, it means Graph Search is already available to you. In my case, I had to click that button, log out of Facebook, and immediately log back in, before I could use Graph Search. Next, to use Graph Search, you simply insert a search phrase in the recently-enlarged search box that now appears in the top left corner of Facebook. When you do that, you will see many new searching options, presented in the drop-down. For instance, lets say you are looking for blue widgets. When you search, the first item to come up likely is the Facebook Page for Blue Widgets. But if Graph Search is enabled, most likely you will also see some new search options, such as: See the screenshot below showing some of these new search options. If you can see those sorts of search options, you know that you have Graph Search enabled. Whether small businesses will get value out of Graph Search  at least in its current form  all depends. It depends on the type of business you have, and your needs. One benefit of Facebook Graph Search is that it may make some businesses easier to get discovered. Thats not true for a business like ours, Small Business Trends. Were not a local business. Not many people will be searching for our type of business by location. Nor will they be searching by, say, type of product to find us. Local businesses or retailers that sell particular types of products, is a different story. Graph Search may be more helpful to them, to get discovered. For example, lets say you run a pizza restaurant. If someone is searching for pizza that their friends like, in their local town, your pizza place may get discovered that way. And for a local business, that could be valuable. For example, I searched for pizza places my friends visited in Cleveland, Ohio, and got a nice list with reviews. If you are a local business, make sure your location is spelled out clearly on your Facebook Page. Take the time to describe your business  the products you sell and services you provide. The more detail on your Facebook Page, the more that can show up in a search. Also, the bigger your following or fan network, the more benefit you get out of Graph Search. Facebook Graph Search is really about search at the intersection of word of mouth. Graph Search is very good for helping someone find out what their friends like. The more people who Like your business, the more chances of your business appearing in the Graph Search results when users search for what their friends like. So keep growing that fan base. Ask satisfied customers to leave reviews of your business, also. Another use of Graph Search could be for prospecting for new customers and connections based on very specific interests, i.e., microtargeting. It can help you identify specific people who like something. Of course, reaching out to them directly might seem intrusive, and backfire. Some Wall Street analysts have talked about the . While that makes for a good investor theme (Facebook is under pressure to increase ad revenues, after all), some of the analysts making those assertions appear not to know much about advertising on Facebook. For instance, you can already slice and dice your ad targets on Facebook. Facebook ads excel at their ability to target people with certain interests. True, those ads dont appear in search results. But Facebooks search results are not Googles search results. Unlike when people search in a search engine, they are not usually searching with buying intent when using Facebook Graph Search. As Eoin Keenan of Silicon Cloudpoints out, in Facebook  most searches will have nothing to do with brands. Searches are designed to find content, like photos or posts that are specified by locations, friends or another identifier. Besides, Graph Search ads are experimental and something for the future. You still cant search through Facebook posts and comments, either, although Facebook is reportedly working on those. Bottom line: dont expect too much out of Graph Search when it comes to your marketing  at least in its current iteration. Aside from helping local businesses get discovered more/better, it may not provide much value to your business. Finally, if you get alarmed at the idea of others being able to search so easily for everything youve personally ever shared on Facebook, . You will find instructions to control what you share publicly.","Internet Explorer remains the dominant Internet browser among its competitors like Firefox, Chrome and Safari  at least according to one measure. And IEs market share continues to grow. In May, Internet Explorer (IE) gained slightly, and now has almost 56 percent of market share, according to the , which tracks page views on Web browsers worldwide. By comparison, Firefox and Google Chrome released new versions in the last month, but each still lags far behind Internet Explorer. Firefox was able to chip away somewhat at IEs market dominance and at the same time, distance itself from Chrome. Firefox is the second choice, with about 21 percent of all users. Chrome comes in third at nearly 16 percent. Safari is the leading Mac browser at just under 6 percent of the overall market. However, not everyone agrees with the Net Application numbers. One major service, StatCounter, as the most popular browser. StatCounters breakdown of browser market share is: Chrome at 41 percent, IE at about 28 percent, Firefox at about 20 percent and Safari at around 8 percent. The difference is in where the two services get their data, and how they count it. , Net Applications counts unique users, whereas StatCounter counts page views, for determining browser share: on competing browser market share numbers, for those who need a statistics fix. So what can you do with this information? Keep it in mind for purposes of your website design. Validate that your website or Web application is properly viewable in the most popular browsers, especially recent versions. Cross check against your own website analytics, too. Individual audiences may vary. If the vast majority of your Web visitors use Chrome, for instance, it would be foolish not to have an optimized experience for them in Chrome.","Paperwork is the bane of the modern office. Today, Adobe says 7 in 10 employees would seek other employment just to be rid of it. Whats more, the company says its data shows 83 percent of workers believe antiquated paperwork and the processes behind it are slowing them down at work. Adobe hopes to change that with the introduction of its new Document Cloud service. In an official announcement introducing the new product March 17, Adobe Senior Vice President of Technology and Corporate Development Bryan Lamkin explains: In short, the Adobe Document Cloud consists of several new services that will allow your business and your team to create, review, approve, sign, and track documents across any device. The Document Cloud will also be integrated with Adobes other . There are four new services included with Adobe Document Cloud: This is like the original Adobe Acrobat but better, the company says. Acrobat DC will feature a touch-based interface. Adobe says that Acrobat DC will use Photoshop imaging magic that converts any paper document into a digital and editable file. This file can then be sent to your companys clients or customers, altered, marked or signed as needed and then shipped back with just a few taps. This service included with Adobe Document Cloudis actually a re-branded Adobe product originally called EchoSign. The service allows you to send out a document, like a PDF, to anyone on any device. From there, the recipient can read it, fill out any needed information, and include a signature before its sent back to you. With this brand new feature, there should be no need to tell your clients, Ill send you an invoice when I get back to the office. Now, you can create, edit, and share a document right from a tablet or smartphone. There are two apps that allow you to do this and theyre included with a Document Cloud subscription: Acrobat Mobile and Fill-and-Sign. And even if youve started a document at the office, the work will follow you to your mobile devices where you can finish it, or vice versa. Now, there will be no more guessing about whether your client or team received your documents. Send and Track uses intelligent tracking to let you know when someone has opened a document, their progress with it, and when theyre done too. If your business is being slowed by old-fashioned paperwork, Adobe Document Cloud surely looks like something to consider. Managing Partner at CRM Essentials Brent Leary insists Adobes ability to create PDF documents quickly and efficiently is among the most exciting features the new product has to offer. In an interview with Small Business Trends, Leary explained The PDF form is still prevalent. This streamlines the process tremendously. Most impressive, Leary insists, is Adobes ability to scan a paper document and translate that into a digital PDF. Any blank lines on the paper are rendered into a form field which a recipient can then fill in. Leary adds, Being able to have a better process for handling, contracts, invoices, and getting signatures. All these things make you more efficient.","The 2012 business year officially starts today. With the mini-breaks and shortened weeks gone, all thats left to do is tackle that To-Do list thats twice the length of your arm once and for all. If you need help figuring out where to start or what habits to pick up in social media this year, below are 10 social media resolutions every small business owner would be smart to make. Well start slow. : Your brand is your identity in business. If you havent already taken the steps to protect it and throughout the Web, start the year off by doing just that. Knowem is a fantastic service that allows you to easily search and claim more than 550 popular social networking sites at little cost. Even if you dont plan on using all 500 (or even five) of these sites, protecting your username will ensure that youre able to use them in the future should you change your mind AND that no one else can hijack your brands identity and speak to your customers. Its your first step to social media success. : Just because Knowem allows you to claim more than 500 social media profiles, doesnt mean you have to use all of them. Instead, focus on 2-3 social media sites, sites where you know your audience is and that may already be delivering traffic, and really invest in devoting time there. For example, maybe youve found that you get a lot of traffic from Yelp. Why not invest more in that site by optimizing your Yelp profile, using their analytics, and taking advantage of their specials? Instead of worrying about being everywhere, focus on developing a strong presence where it counts for your business. Once you get the hang of those first two sites, you can spread your wings to some of the others. : Before you really engage, work on building your ears. Listening in social media will help you identify the people you want to be talking to, the conversations worth your time, and may just prevent you from royally putting your foot in your mouth. If you need help, iGoogle can help you build a or check out a service like which has cost-effective plans to help SMBs stay in the loop. : If 2012 is the year youre going to get serious about social media, then you really need to serious about it. And you do that by scheduling social media into your day the same way you schedule all of your other tasks. Because thats the only way its going to get done. Find a way to dedicate 30 minutes a day into updating Twitter, responding to people on Facebook or commenting on industry blogs. If you dont schedule it, you wont do it. Its as simple as that. : When I broke down my , I talked about online reviews as becoming an increasingly important social signal for the search engines. The engines are looking at reviews to help bring accountability back to the Web and, frankly, so are users. Creating a full-on online review strategy may sound intimidating, but all it really means is is encouraging your customers to talk about their experiences on the sites you want them to do the talking on. Thats nothing to be shy over. Use your Web site, your emails, your newsletter, you advertisements, and your face-to-face interactions to help them do that. : Hey, I know. Sometimes it can be hard to find the time or the motivation to blog. Weve already helped spark some , now its time for you to dedicate the time to doing it. Even if youre just blogging a couple times a week, its going to help you build a community, have something to always share with your audience, and help you in search. If youve been putting it off or not blogging as often as you should, 2012 is the year to fix that. : A great way to always have something to say and blog about it is to keep up with what others are saying. Use Twitter or Google Blog Search to help you identify authoritative (or at least interesting) blogs in your space that you can use as conversation starters and as a way to stay up to date on whats happening in your corner of the world. : Do something crazy this year and . Go find out where people who do what you do are meeting and join them. Talk to them. Share with them. Online interaction can only go so far before you have to take it offline. : Its not enough to simply BE in social media. You have find ways to reward fans and give them for why it is they should like you, follow you, talk to you. Fifty-eight percent of users exclusive content or discounts for liking a brand on Facebook. Thats pretty significant. So if youre not using your social media presence to reward customers for their interaction with you, youre letting them down. : Have you read the nine previous resolutions? Theres some work involved there. And if youre going to be putting in the blood, sweat and tears needed to create a powerful social presence, then you darn well better be these accounts at every turn. That means making them visible on your Web site, putting their logos on your customer receipts, highlighting them in your email newsletters and on business cards, and linking to them wherever you can. Dont hide your social media. Flaunt it. Above are ten social media resolutions I think all SMBs would be smart to make this year. Whats your biggest social media goal for 2012? How are you making it happen?","Following the lead of other social networks like Facebook and Twitter, Pinterest is ramping up its marketing features. Back in September 2013, Pinterest announced it was beginning to experiment with . Now the company says it is rolling out a do-it-yourself promoted pin feature in beta too. Back in September, company CEO and Co-Founder Ben Silbermann had described the new sponsored pins as a way for advertisers to have paid content come up in results and category feeds. An example Silbermann had given at the time was a sponsored pin of a Batman costume coming up under a search for the term Halloween. The ads are also apparently for bigger brands working directly with Pinterest, ClickZ .

US shale oil production is expected to fall in August for a tenth straight month, by 99,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 4.55 million bpd, according to a US drilling productivity report on Monday. Further weighing on supply, US commercial inventories likely fell by 2.2 million barrels last week, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Monday. That would be the ninth consecutive week stocks have fallen. The poll was taken ahead of weekly oil stocks reports due on Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and on Wednesday from the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA). Giving some support to prices, China's crude oil imports - which slowed partly due to seasonal refinery maintenance in May and June - could rebound in the second half of the year as refineries there further diversify sources of supply, shipbroker Banchero Costa (Bancosta) said in a report on Tuesday. China's crude imports grew 14.2 per cent during January to June, with most of the gains coming from huge increases in supply from Russia, Oman, Iraq and Brazil, said Ralph Leszczynski, head of research at Bancosta.","If youre a fan of books like Love is the Killer App and Nuts, then you will enjoy This is one of those books about the cool companies you wish you had worked for, or better yet, had launched.

My mantra and attitude looking ahead is all about leading with optimism  a powerful, transformative energy. People are finally feeling optimistic enough to invest more in themselves, their businesses and others. The recovery fatigue many of us have been feeling is finally lifting and shifting from recovery to growth and people want in and to enjoy it more.

And while Vine certainly works to any businesss advantage on its own, it can also be used to enhance your written content as part of a larger campaign, or through linking and embedding Vine videos in your text. Lets take a look at a few ways that small businesses can use Vine videos to add some zip to their written content. Big businesses like Taco Bell have been using Vine to showcase new products, but thanks to Vines 6-second limit, you dont need a huge budget to produce a mini commercial or demonstration of your product or service. So, for example, you could use Vine videos to supplement a description with a view of the real thing, in action. Sure, you could tweet back and forth, but theres something extra personal about interacting with brand fans and customers through video. You could respond to customer feedback via a Vine video, you could work it into a larger content strategy like Honda recently did in its or you can simply say thank you as Vine has done below. Blogging about the day to day functioning of your business, or talking about a special event? Shoot a quick Vine video to to your followers. Going behind the scenes through writing is one thing, but a quick Vine video can really bring your business to life and show people exactly who you are and what you do. I think that encouraging followers to submit their own content is one of the most dynamic ways to engage with people, and the best part is that it takes little to no effort for you. You could run a contest with prizes for users submitting the best Vine videos like Urban Outfitters recently did, or simply use Vine as a fun way to get feedback. You can show that youre a thought leader without long-form posts and lengthy tutorials. In 6 seconds, you can share interesting and informative details about your field, about your product or service, or about anything else that your potential (and loyal) customers might find useful. Even the San Francisco Zoo has started . And while you might not have any tigers on staff,Im sure you can come up with something almost as interesting to share.","Weve been talking about it for months and its finally here. October 1 has come and gone, making it open enrollment season, and your employees are officially able to enroll in the Health Insurance Marketplace if that is the direction you decided to take your benefits. Although you might be done with the preparatory messaging and employee outreach, youre still in the midst of answering questions as your employees work to determine if they want to obtain coverage through the marketplace. Were willing to bet they have a lot of questions. According to the 2013 Aflac WorkForces Report, three out of four (76 percent) are not very/not at all knowledgeable about federal and state health care marketplace. Thats why we have compiled a list of about health insurance marketplaces and the impact they will have on employer-sponsored benefits in 2014. Health insurance marketplaces (also known as an exchange) are a Web portal where individuals and businesses can shop for and buy health insurance. The two marketplaces that will impact employee benefits are: The Marketplace coverage will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2014. Most anyone can use the Health Insurance Marketplace operating in their state to explore health insurance options, even if they already have insurance. Individuals must be U.S. residents, U.S. citizens (or lawfully present), and not currently incarcerated. can also use the marketplaces. However, states can choose to keep the limit to those with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees through 2016. Private health insurance marketplaces offer health coverage options to multiple workforce sizes. Additionally, they can sell all products and services, including voluntary insurance. Many private health insurance marketplaces can help employers to move toward a defined contribution model that can help control health care costs, while still providing employees robust (PDF) options through a defined contribution. Individuals or small businesses may be (PDF) for tax credits or subsidies through the state or federal public health insurance marketplaces. The purpose of this is to help offset the cost of coverage and defray some costs associated with using health care services. What does this mean? These plans pay approximately 70 percent of covered medical expenses or actuarial value. Silver is one of four levels of coverage offered in the marketplace. Each level varies depending on the proportion of medical expenses the insurance plan is expected to cover: Silver is the benchmark for calculating subsidies, though individuals can buy-up to other plan levels, as well as dental coverage. Since employees are able to purchase health insurance coverage directly through the health insurance marketplaces, it is important for them to understand their coverage options and health risks. The Affordable Care Act required businesses to for tax credits or subsidies. But, ultimately, employees are responsible for deciding how to spend their health care dollars. Use this open enrollment season as an opportunity to further educate your workforce about the marketplace and other health care-related changes","There are 3,000 different franchises available in the US, and they fall under five general categories.

Unfortunately, you dont have many subscribers to your regular email newsletter. These visitors are finding your site okay, but once they leave, they never return. Now imagine you could give them an incentive for signing up for your newsletter. This might include a chance to win a big prize like a great weekend getaway, a new Tiffany Co Gift Card, an iPad and Apple TV combo or other prize. A startup called gives you a way to offer high ticket prizes on your website as an incentive for the leads you need. Incentivibe CEO and Co-Founder, Adeel Vanthaliwala, took time out recently for an exclusive interview with Small Business Trends to explain. Heres the problem, said Vanthaliwala. While website businesses have worked long and hard to build traffic on their sites, converting that traffic into leads is a bit more difficult.In fact, according to data supplied by Incentivibe, 95 percent of the people who visit your website leave without ever becoming leads. One solution is to offer free ebooks or white papers to visitors in return for newsletter signup or other actions. But Vanthaliwala said this generally only works for business to business websites  and with less success if you sell to consumers. Worse yet, he added, for some visitors white papers or other information just arent enough of an incentive to sign up and give you their email addresses. Larger prizes might create more incentive, Vanthaliwala said. But the cost is sometimes prohibitive to small startup websites. They may not have the budget to spend for giveaways week after week or month after month. Incentivibe offers websites the ability to pool their resources by paying a fraction of the cost of a larger prize. For example, for a $24.99 monthly fee, small websites can participate in a giveaway for a prize worth $500. A site owner simply installs a widget with the giveaway information to his or her website. Incentivibe offers integration with a wide variety of platforms including Magento, Shopify, Big Commerce, Volusion, Unbounce, WordPress and any custom-made website. The contest widget includes only the name of the site on which it appears. So site owners dont need to worry about promoting other sites inadvertently. They can even co-sponsor a contest with a competitor, said Vanthaliwala. Incentivibe also offers free administration of the contests and free contest rules tailored to legally meet the requirements of your country or region. Vanthaliwala and co-founder and chief technology officer Abdul Basit Munda came up with the idea for Incentivibe while in February 2012. Carrying $50,000 in debt and working two to three part-time jobs at a time to support their families, Vanthaliwala and Munda decided to learn from their own mistakes and built a new business as a result. Vanthaliwala explains in a post on the companys official blog: For a basic overview of Incentivibes service, view the video below.","Thomson Reuters In brief: Here's Lutz: US Futures are climbing 30bp as Chinese PMIs propel commodities higher and heavy selling of Sovs persists.

Annual expenditures for taxes for most owners is likely their largest outlay each year, exceeding rent or mortgage payments, marketing costs, and vehicle expenses (the only possible larger expenditure is payroll). Beyond payments to the government for all of the taxes you payincome taxes on profits; Social Security, Medicare, and other employment taxeslikesales taxes, property taxes, and excise taxesthere are other tax-related costs: your time and effort in record keeping and fees to your tax advisors. So, taxes are a big deal. Did you know that: Small business owners have much on their mindsrevenues, customers, government regulations. But, according to a , taxes continue to be of paramount concern to millennial and boomer micro-businesses. Several years ago that 88percentof small businesses used paid preparers forcompleting their tax return. My guess is that this number is not lower now. Its likely higher. But this statistic is only for tax return preparation. What about your payroll taxes? Your personal estimated taxes? You may use an outside payroll provider to help with payroll taxes or do this in-house. Your personal estimated taxes, which are paid four times a year, usually are up to you. But you may turn to a paid preparer for advice. Even though most use paid preparers for tax return preparation, many tax chores still fall on small business owners or their employees. These include record-keeping, seeing to tax payments, and meeting or talking with preparers. How much time does it take? It depends who you ask: The cost of compliance is higher on small businesses than on large ones. This burden is estimated to cost small businesses $18 to $19 billion per year. And planning to have the cash on hand to pay tax bills is also up to you. Cash flow planning for various tax obligations can take up some time throughout the year. Because small businesses rely on professionals, the cost for tax return preparation and other tax matters can be $10,000 each year. And, unfortunately, its all too easy to make mistakes, which can cost you additional interest and penalties. What has come to be a perennial or bi-annual state of affairs for more than five years, the tax rules for 2015 are not yet settled, even though the first quarter of the year is over. The 50+ tax rules that had expired at the end of 2013 and were extended for 2014 have again expired. The House has been trying to make many favored rules for small business, including the high Sec. 179 deduction and the 100percentexclusion for gain on the sale of qualified small business stock. The Senate has yet to take up the question of permanence, and of course, concerns about a Presidential veto of any permanent tax legislation remain. Taxes arent a favorite subject of most small businesses, but attending to them has a direct impact on your bottom line. So, my advice: pay attention to taxes throughout the year (not just at tax time), use a professional to help you (the fees you pay are probably less than what your time is worth), and watch for changes from Congress.","Today, theres a social network for just about every interest and demographic. People use social media for everything from landing a job to finding old friends, from promoting a business to pure entertainment. For small businesses, social media can be a key driver for online marketing. One of the golden rules is to make it easy for people to help you spread the word about your businessand one-click social sharing buttons are as easy as it gets. So you might think the more buttons, the merrier. If you offer enough social sharing buttons, anyone visiting your website will be able to instantly share your pages, posts and more with their friends, no matter which of the dozens of social networking platforms they use. Unfortunately, it doesnt work that way. If youre displaying a big chunk of social sharing buttons thats longer than some of your posts, you might come across as desperatewhich can be a major turnoff for todays online consumers. Beyond that, offering so many choices can actually make the decision to share more complicated for visitors. You want to make things easyand for people who use more than one social network (which is most of them), fewer is easier. Finally, not all social media networks match your target demographics. If you run a B2B company, having people share your info on Reddit wont do you much good. The best choices for social sharing buttons are those that will get you exposure to the widest possible audience that contains your target demographics. (An infographic from The Search Agents shows which networks are the most among what audiences.) In some cases, your small business might benefit from an alternate sharing button, especially if youre in a niche industry. But in general, the important connections to offer your visitors are: The number one social network on the planet with 800 million users, including 2/3 of the population of the United States. Facebook is effective for sharing any and all types of content across a vast map of digital connections. The second most popular site for sharing, Twitter is a must for small business because of the speed at which messages and links can travel. Catch the right audience, and tweets about your business could spread to millions in just a few hours. An up-and-comer in the social networking world, having your content shared on Google+ gives you an advantage with the most used search engine in the world. The Google+ sharing button is especially important if your target demographics lean toward malesince more than twice as many males as females use this social network. The network for business-related activity, LinkedIn is the professional heavy hitter. Its a must for connecting with people in your industry and particularly useful if youre scouting for fresh talent. The original sharing button, including a quick email connection with your content ensures that all your bases are coveredeven if you happen to have visitors who dont use social media. The popular image-based social network, is the best choice for small businesses with largely female target demographics. If your business relates to weddings, beauty, food, home, fashion, design, personal interests, or DIY, swap out Google+ for Pinterest in your social sharing button choices.","Today, online marketing tool provider announced its acquisition of mobile loyalty application CardStar. CardStar is the mobile version of the loyalty cards we all carry around in our walletsonly condensed into a single app. CardStar, which is available as an application for Android, iPhone, Nokia, BlackBerry and Windows phones, currently has more than 2 million users. Consumers can keep track of multiple membership and rewards cards, such as what you would scan at a CVS or Best Buy. Merchants can send geotargeted offers to customers, as well as track consumer behavior with the application, according to CardStars site. As to why Constant Contact decided to get into the mobile loyalty space, CEO Gail Goodman said: In the past, loyalty programs have been most popular with big-box retailers. Small businesses havent jumped in to the same degree, maybe due to the fact that loyalty programs have been, in Goodmans words, too administratively cumbersome. Most small businesses dont have the bandwidth to manage the analytics and track coupon redemption of their individual loyalty programs.

Online payment giant PayPal has been known to freeze the accounts for some crowdfunding projects. A freeze on your money could have disastrous results for your business or new project. Thats what happened to Lab Zero CEO Peter Batholow last year. He tried to access some of the $700,000 his crowdfunding project had raised. With his account frozen though, he was unable to even get the money to pay his employees on time, Venture Beat . PayPals Chief Risk Officer, Tomer Barel, explained his companys previous policy this week in a blog : The problem, it seems, has to do with PayPals concerns over chargebacks. Thats when customers reverse a payment through PayPal alleging they did not get the product or service they paid for, Venture Beat reports. But Barel says that as PayPal continues to partner with crowdfunding sites and consumers become more familiar with the risk of backing a project, a change is needed. PayPals website now clearly that it supports donation and reward-based crowdfunding projects. Now, if youre running a crowdfunding campaign and expect to access your money through PayPal, the company will contact you early in the process. It will ensure that youre familiar with the expectations and guidelines PayPal has for crowdfunders. It will also offer a flexible, safer, and more secure payment option. Barel writes:","Ever feel as if all your social media interactions with customers are in one universe, and all your customer contact information is in an alternate universe  never to come together? Batchbook doesnt think that is a good way for businesses to work. The company just announceda new , aiming to let you to see contact information and social media interactions with your clients, in one spot. Batchbook is a customer relationship management (CRM) system designed for small businesses to manage their contact information with customers and clients. Like other new breeds of CRM applications, the company terms itself social CRM. That means, Batchbook recognizes that interactions today with customers may involve a social element. A client may have connected with one of your key staff on LinkedIn, and expects you to be aware of that. If youve had a conversation with the client on Twitter, you are going to want to know that the next time you communicate. And so on. According to Batchbook, the benefit of the integration with HootSuite is that your business will get more insights into social activity with clients and other important stakeholder contacts. It youre a HootSuite user, you can use it to update and monitor social media accounts. Youll now also be able to see customer contact information from the Batchbook CRM system within the HootSuite dashboard, and interact with the Batchbook system there. The image above shows a Batchbook contact page on the left and the HootSuite dashboard on the right. The Batchbook app is available in HootSuites app directory. Once you add the app, you can edit contact details from your Batchbook account directly from within the HootSuite dashboard. You can even add tweets or Facebook posts from HootSuite into your Batchbook records. Need to find contact details for a client who just mentioned your business in a tweet? Want to find the last interaction you had with a customer who recently posted a question on your businesss Facebook wall? Those kinds of activities are now something you can do in one spot. The advantage, according to Batchbooks CEO Pamela OHara, is that your team will have more context for customer interactions. Your team then can make communications more personalized. In turn, customers are more likely tofeel that they are actually being heard, instead of just receiving a canned response. Batchbook is not the only provider moving toward bringing together various types of customer communications  social media, email marketing, and contact records  into one place. weve seen a number of mergers/acquisitions, partnerships and product enhancements announced among providers in the email marketing, CRM and social media tools space. The line between such tools is blurring. Its no coincidence. The end customer is changing his/her/its behavior. Businesses have to respond. Simply put, today some customers expect to interact with companies on social media. For instance, customers are getting used to using Twitter as a way to raise customer service questions. Socially-aware businesses recognize that to serve their customers properly, they need quick access to the entire picture  not just one slice of the interactions. Data marooned by itself in other systems doesnt help. So why did Batchbook choose to integrate with HootSuite and not simply re-create that functionality in Batchbook? For one thing, its hard to pull users away from tools they already know and love. HootSuite has 5+ million users worldwide and is already popular with small businesses. Notes OHara: OHara added that Batchbook will consider a partnership with any app or tool that can help businesses engage in more personal conversations with customers and other contacts. Batchbook, which is based in Providence, Rhode Island, first launched 2006. It currently has tens of thousands of active accounts.","Forget plastic bodies and Kevlar skins.

How can a small retailer keep up? Start by digesting Retail Rebooted, a new on retail trends from JWT: True, the report focuses on larger retail chains and while many of the things theyre doing arent (or arent yet) practical or affordable for small retailers, there is still a lot to learn. Youll want to pore over the massive report yourself, but here are some of the key takeaways. The primary trend affecting small companies is Retail as the Third Space. While this has been underway for a while, its really taking hold now. As eCommerce and become more prevalent, JWT says, brick-and-mortar retail will increasingly serve as a third space thats only partly about transactions. Its just as much (if not more) about the customer experience, customer service and a unique, engaging environment. Customers want in-person service they cant get online. This is crucial to differentiating your store from the one-dimensional online shopping experience. Make sure your salespeople are well trained in customer service and empowered to make the customer experience outstanding. Hire for personality. You can teach someone to work a cash register, but you cant teach people skills. Retail locations that are visually attractive and appealing are a big draw. Sensory experiences can take opposite forms. If your target market is kids or teens, you might want sensory overload with lots of excitement. If its moms, you might want a restful, relaxing escape from the stress of daily life. Look at your store with a critical eye to how it looks, sounds, even smells. Something as simple as playing the right music or adding comfortable chairs where customers friends can relax while they shop can make a huge difference in how much time customers spend with you. Customers no longer have to go to stores to buy, so you have to work harder. Its always been the case that retail is competing for discretionary dollars, but today its even clearer that your store is competing with other leisure activities like going to a park, museum or sporting event. Hold events that make your store a fun, exciting gathering place. A cosmetics boutique could hold makeover sessions; a childrens bookstore can host readings; a gourmet food shop can have regular tastings. Buying online is convenient, but can also lead to overload, as anyone whos ever shopped for shoes on Zappos.com can attest. Consumers often feel overwhelmed by the abundance [of choices] offered online and want retailers to curate, the report states. You cant compete with Zappos or Walmart, so dont even try. Instead, focus on creating a carefully curated experience offering the best of the best. Use window and store displays to highlight your selections and emphasize your picks (Staff Favorites or Favorite Mothers Day Gifts). Your employees must act as curators too, being able to advise customers on their purchases and knowledgeable about your stock. Customers expect a seamless transition between shopping on your website (if you have an eCommerce site) and shopping at your store. If your business has both an eCommerce and brick-and-mortar component, make sure the experiences are integrated so one is an extension of the other. Take an in-depth look at your store and website. Does your brand look and feel the same online and off? Try navigating your website like a customer would, paying attention to ease of browsing and buying. Provide services like allowing customers to order in-store and have products delivered to their homes, or ordering online and picking up in-store, or returning online purchases in-store so they can deal with a live person. Big retailers are taking advantage of customers reliance on mobile phones to grab tons of data and personalize the sales experience. Lots of this is still beyond a small businesss budget, but its important to be aware of. Make sure your store has a presence on local search sites like Google and so mobile shoppers find you when theyre looking for what you sell. Also check into geofencing, which uses mobile GPS technology to send texts to consumers who opt-in to receive messages from you when theyre within a certain radius of your store. If a prospect is at your competitors across the street, they could get a text from you announcing a special offer or other reason to head into your store. Pretty cool.","In honor of National Small Business Week, Facebook is highlighting the firsthand stories of small businesses that are using the social network to reach customers. Whether using the site to actually sell products or just to promote, Facebook has changed the way businesses communicate with consumers. Victoria Wise and Meredith Miner just wanted to start a small side project when they decided to start selling jewelry on Facebook in 2011. The two had been friends for years and had seven kids between their two families. They understood the difficulties for busy moms and wanted to provide an easy way to shop for stylish accessories. So they set up nightly auctions on Facebook and shared them with friends and family. Jewelry Nut Auctions quickly grew to about 500 fans and then those fans continued spreading the word. Soon, the workload and profits grew to the point where they needed to expand. Jewelry Nut Auctions now has 13 employees and brings in more than $1.5 million in annual sales. Wendy Gavinski grew up in Wisconsin. So she has been a snowmobiler from a young age. She had always noticed a void in the snowmobile accessories market for any type of feminine fitting or attractive snowmobile gear for women. So a few years ago, she started sketching her own ideas for snowmobiling outfits. She found a manufacturer and started creating her own line of outfits for her new business venture, Divas SnowGear. Since female snowboarders make up a pretty specific niche market, Gavinski had trouble reaching potential customers through traditional advertising and promotional methods like TV and print. Thats where Facebook came in. Gavinski created a Facebook page and used Facebook advertising to target female snowboarders specifically. Shes since seen Divas SnowGears sales climb and her products are now available online and in powersports retailers throughout the U.S. and Canada. When Mychal Stittsworth purchased his fathers meat market four years ago, he knew he needed to make some changes to the business. He created a Facebook page to try and connect with people in the community and get them to stop by for more than just special occasions. He did notice more people mentioning Facebook as they came into Stittsworth Meats. He also noticed the pages fan base grow. But he still wasnt satisfied. For years, Stittsworths father had placed ads in a local newspaper, but he noticed a poor return on that investment once he took over. So he decided instead to spend that money on Facebook ads and giveaways for the companys fans. Since that time, Stittsworth said yearly sales have increased by 250%. Nancy Morozin was already an established business owner before joining Facebook. She wasnt interested in creating a social media presence for The Dining Car, the diner she owned with her brother and sister. She only established a Facebook page because she received a call from a Facebook rep saying that she needed to claim the page to prevent someone else from doing so. So she created an account and didnt even so much as upload a picture at first. It was only after the page reached 500 likes that she began making posts. She loved seeing the engagement from customers and fans. She used it to highlight particular dishes and specials and noticed people coming into the diner talking about things they had seen on Facebook. Now she uses Facebook all the time  both for herself and for her business. Mark Osborne had been a fan of craft beer for years before starting the Facebook page for Adroit Theory Brewing Company in 2011. He actually created the Facebook page before even opening his business as a way of communicating with customers and creating buzz. He started running ads and promoting posts, and eventually got up to 5,500 likes before even selling any beer. He officially opened the brewerys tasting room in January, and said there was a lot of excitement surrounding the opening. Since the brewery is small and relies on personal connections through tastings and similar events, Osborne said that promoting on Facebook allows him to get the word out in a similarly personalized manner.","Todays savvy, tech-driven customers have taken complete control of how they select products and services they end up buying. In most cases, they have made their decision before they talk to the vendor they choose. Which means many sales people are being shut out of the decision making process altogether. Nikolaus Kimla, sales process expert and Founder of Pipeliner CRM, shares his thoughts on the changing role of the sales professional in todays consumer climate, how sales people can better align their sales process with how consumers are buying today, and the role sales technology should play to help them stay connected with buyers over the long haul. * * * * * Im originally from Austria, Vienna. I moved two years ago to the United States because I realized I have to bring my product to the next level, and this can only be done here because thisis the country of sales. The buyer is very different, in my opinion, between transactional sales, classical consulting sales, or enterprise sales. In the consumer side of classical transaction sales, tremendous change has happened. In the future, we will not speak to aperson, we will speak to machines. Similar towhen you buy a book by Amazon. Amazonknows you, gives you the right books or even some movies that are related to your books. Amazonknows about your patterns, so everything goes into the pattern recognition systems. Its very profound and very deep. Transactional sales, I would say, is in the biggest change. We are all, in some form, a buyer. On the other hand, consulting sales is in an even deeper change for sales people. This is the big challenge for the future because the buyer is not so much interested in the product, hes more interested in the value that youre creating  and actually even creating some business opportunities for him. That means you are more a business consultant. There is a tremendous change and I personally believe most sellers are not ready for that. First of all, I would say they needto understand how social can impact getting more information onyour prospects. What really drives them? What is really in there? Its really about investigation. For that reason, its a lot of preparation. You have to prepare much more than in the old days. To say, I know the industry, the vertical market. I know about the pains of the buyer. I address the pains because my product is asolution. I think this is too narrow-minded now. You have to be more complex. The seller really has a lot of challenges. He has to inform himself, so he needs a lot of education on the one hand. On the other hand, he needs tools that help him on adaily basis run his shop efficiently, easily, smoothly and effectively so that he can really concentrate on what its all about. You haveto go into the heart of the buyer and tell themthat you understand theirneeds. You understand where he is heading and that the solution that you have for him can bring this impact to him in the future. Vendors are moving in the area of saying, My tool is easier for data entering and for correcting data and keeping up the data. Perfect. I strongly believe sales people will never do that. As easy as the tool is, they will never do it, right? This is not in their personality, even if you have the most advanced and easiest tool in the world. So I think this is a pitfall. The issue is, you cannot change a sales person. It makes no sense. Where are their strengths? Its about what theyre doing in their job. They should not be bookkeepers. Its not their job. Their job is to sell and to understand the complexity and everything involved, so its about the process. You have to know your process. If you are not tweaking the process constantly, changing it to the needs of the buyer and to the needs of the industry, to respond to competitors because theyre doing something, and constantly working with your sales team and giving them some insight with dynamic playbooks then youre lost in the future. Most sales managers are just managing data whenthey should manage people, not data. Technology should help visualize the process. Then you work on the core, and the core is the person. You have to work with the person. Go to , and then to the blog. You will see a lot of people contributing.

If you own a business or are responsible for a business, do you monitor your reputation online to see what clients and other people are saying about you? Given the statistics above, if you are not monitoring your online reputation, you really need to start doing this as it can significantly impact your business  both positively and negatively. As an example, think of a product or service and then search this product or service on Google and include your city. In most cases, you will be given the Google+ Business Listings at or near the top of the search results. Now put yourself in a potential clients shoes.  If these potential clients have a choice between a company with a significant amount of great reviews and one that has bad reviews or even no reviews, I would bet that in most cases these potential clients would choose a company with positive reviews over companies with bad reviews or no reviews. Give this a try. Put your product or service and your city in Google and see what the results are. You will see one of 4 results: If you have nothing but good reviews or a very high concentration of good reviews and very few bad reviews, then keep doing what you are doing. If you have a lot of bad reviews or no reviews, then you will be turning business away and you should look at the following 3 recommendations: If you monitor and manage your online reputation and add great reviews, this should have a positive effect on your business.

One of the questions was: The answer was telling  and not because it was a surprise. It was telling because it is almost exactly in alignment with a survey we conducted online here at Small Business Trends almost a decade ago. By far the most common way customers learn about a business is from word of mouth, according to the small businesses in the survey. Eighty-five percent of the small businesses surveyed said customers learn about them through word of mouth. The chart above shows all theresponses. As you can see, no other type of marketing or advertising even comes close. Search engines come ina distant second at 59%. Everything else isfar behind. in our survey, 83% said that referrals (i.e., word of mouth from existing customers) were the number one way of getting customers. The results were very consistent. In one sense its strikingthat the method that is (a) most personal, and (b)costs the least in out-of-pocket expenditures, is the top method of attracting new customers. After all, youd expect that by throwing money at the problem via expensive advertising, and through methods that scale to reach many, youd getgreater results. At least thats what youmight think. But in another sense, its completely predictable that word of mouth is the number one method of attracting new customers. We small businesses are all about thepersonalized approach. With small businesses, its not about casting a wide net, but rather about connecting with a select number of customers, enlisting their trust and loyalty,and having that positive impression spill over among their circle of friends and colleagues. That said, what does it suggest about steps you should be taking to increase and leverage word of mouth? Here are four items for your To-Do list to increaseword of mouth: Even if search engines werent the #2 way customers have of learning about a small business, keep in mind that word of mouth spreads online as well as offline today. Your customers are online today. Even if you run a local brick-and-mortar business, chances are they check you out online. In other words, word-of-mouth today goes well beyond Mary Smith talking during exercise classes to a friend about your new restaurant. If there is something negative online, its not a question of burying your head in the sand. You need to be aware, so you can fix it. Make no mistake, you fix many negative impressions, such as customer complaints or negative reviews. But first you have to know about them  and not be blindsided or ignore them because theyretoo painful to confront. Once you know about them, you can contact the customer, leave unemotional explanations if the information looks incorrect, or seek out more positive reviews to convey a more balanced impression.

The ones who are very positive are called Promoters. The ones who are negative are called Detractors. Net them out, and you have a Net Promoter score. Today, with online survey tools (some of which are integrated with the software that manages your house email list), its not hard to discover and keep track of your Net Promoter score. Increasing your Net Promoter score gives you something for your team to rally around and set improvement goals. So by all means, start measuring and analyzing. Discover what is making Detractors out of some, and Promoters out of others. Not only doyou want to eradicate whats turning people into Detractors, but more importantly you want to understand what your customers value so much that they are wildly enthusiastic about your business. When you figure out what turns customers into raving fans, then you know what to do to get more of them talking about you, more often. You might think its obvious to your employees that they should be trying to make customers ecstatic. But Ive been in business long enough to know that employees take their cue from the top. If you spend a lot of time focusing on solvingnegative complaints, you may be inadvertently sending signals that customer service only matters when theres a complaint. Instead, you should be sending signals toget ahead of the curve. Customer service matters BEFORE someone getsupset, when you have the opportunity to turnsomeone into that raving fan of your company. Spend some time explaining to employees where most new customers come from and how valuable it is to have existing customers who love your company. Dont assume that your employees actually pick up on that. Show your appreciation publicly when theygo above and beyond to delight customers. I used to think it was corny when companies had mission statements that said we delight our customers. I would think, Everyone knows that you should be delighting customers! But then I realizedthat everyone doesnt necessarilybelievethat  unless you talk the talk and walk the walk. The reality is, your employees at all levels need to hear the messagerepeatedly. They need to believe that YOU believe it. This is where traditional marketing and advertising can support and amplify customerword-of-mouth. Consciously develop initiatives that get happy customers talking. Make it easy for them to share their positive impressions. Also, make it easy for existing customers to refertheir friends, family and colleagues.

While employees themselves know the worth of their pay checks, they might not be aware of the value of their other benefits  even if theyre taking advantage of them. Making sure your workforce understands the value of everything youre offering could be a critical step in ensuring that your employees dont jump ship because they think theyre being shorted on the benefits front.According to the 2013 Aflac WorkForces Report, 59 percent of employees indicated they would take a job with slightly lower pay if it came with more robust benefits. Remember, you risk talent going elsewhere because they think theyll be getting better benefits, when in reality, its possible theyll only be getting better-communicated benefits. Wise entrepreneurs are using the open enrollment period to switch employees focus from a narrow view of health care benefits to a broader perspective that looks at total benefits or total rewards. Encouraging So, what are total rewards? Theyre the entire range of benefits provided to workers, from health care coverage and retirement benefits to career-development opportunities and work-life balance. In a nutshell, total rewards are all the things that help a company attract, motivate and retain employees, communicated to workers in one tidy package. During the recession, many workers made conscious decisions to remain in their current jobs until the financial skies began to clear. With the economy ticking upward, though, many are looking for new opportunities. A recent Right Management survey revealed that 86 percent of employees plan to actively for new jobs in 2013.Furthermore, 55 percent of workers are at least somewhat likely to look for other work if their employers stop offering comprehensive benefits or send them to health insurance marketplaces. Given that superior benefits are an attractive enticement to job seekers, small businesses that want to retain their valued workers and bring in top new talent should communicate about total benefits at open enrollment (now!) and continuously throughout the year. When communicating about total rewards, or the total value of employment, the conversation should expand to encompass not only wages and salaries, but also: When companies do talk about compensation other than salaries, the communication is often muddled by acronyms, jargon and charts that only HR representatives understand. Even companies that comprehend the importance of clear, straightforward benefits communications sometimes drop the ball with respect to timing. Benefits communications should be delivered year round and in small doses to ensure theyre read, understood and absorbed. Key times to spread the benefits message include open enrollment, during recruiting and on-boarding and when a worker is promoted or transferred to another department. The message can also be timed to life events, such as marriage or the birth of a child. Other opportune moments are work anniversaries and significant age milestones. With workers nervous and unsure about how health care reform will affect their benefits packages, small businesses should launch total rewards discussions or even provide employees with annual total rewards report cards outlining the true monetary value of their benefits as soon as possible. Many employees who view the improving economy as a chance to seek jobs with better benefits have skewed impressions of just what constitutes a better benefits package. By reminding workers to consider their full range of benefits, from salary to health care to paid time off and more, many entrepreneurs will help workers realize that the green grass on the other side of the fence  is actually artificial turf.","As the , many tactics that had previously been low cost, easy to implement and effective are becoming less and less effective. For this reason, a lot of small businesses are struggling to to get quality results from SEO on a limited budget. The truth is that things like comprehensive content marketing plans can be very expensive to execute, and for many small businesses a hefty monthly retainer to do SEO right might not be a legitimate possibility. So what can a small business thats on a budget do to improve their search rankings without exposing themselves to a high level of short term risk? One way to leverage external expertise on a limited budget is to contract with an agency in a specific, strategic way. Rather than engaging in a full-on retainer-based relationship, you might consider: In either of these scenarios, youll have to be able to actually execute on the advice generated in the audit/consultation. But youll put yourself in a position to get a premium quality SEO plan on a restricted budget. Your blog is one of the most effective SEO tools you have in your arsenal. At least it can be, if you use it right. But one of the most common stumbling blocks encountered by bloggers and business owners is a lack of content. Fortunately, there are . (Think AllTop, Twitter, Google News and many of the sites youre already using on a daily basis.) The key to coming up with great content ideas is to shift your thinking from that of a content consumer to that of a content curator. What topics are trending? What are your readers and customers asking you about most frequently? What posts have been re-Tweeted hundreds of times on Twitter? Armed with this data, put a new spin on it  and youve got yourself a blog post. Another useful way to generate share-worthy blog content is to collect quotes from internal subject matter experts and create a blog post surrounding this information. If theres a hot-button topic in your industry, consult your leaders and ask for their insights. What are their perspectives on the changing trends, up-and-coming events, or recent happenings? If your internal experts have recognizable names, youve already got one factor in your corner contributing to the share-worthiness of your content. A good way to do this can be to simply create an email distribution list for the right folks within the company, brief them on what youll be doing, then when news breaks send a simple question to everyone on the list and ask for a few sentences / paragraphs on the topic. You simply need to format the responses and you have whats likely to be a highly useful and interesting piece of content. Another way to develop quality inbound links to your site is to create guest blog content. This is a great low budget tactic if youre aiming your efforts at quality blogs and , because youre able to develop thought leadership, get referral traffic to your site, and build authoritative links in exchange for your own expertise and effort. The main takeaway here isnt necessarily that you should choose these three specific tactics, but rather that in looking for low-cost SEO options you want to consider: Combining these two (selective involvement from an SEO and a lot of effort from your own team) can net you some great results.","Telling people what I do for a living has always been a bit difficult. If I say that I do pay-per-click management they ask me how I could possibly spend all day managing paper clips. If I tell them that I am responsible for the ads on their Google search results, I get a groan followed by Youre guy. After explaining in more detail, I usually have a very intelligent conversation and people are fascinated at how interesting PPC advertising is. But Ive noticed that more and more people are mentioning that they feel creeped out by the ads they see; like theyre being followed. But are they? In short, yes, they probably are. This tactic has been around for a few years and is commonly referred to as retargeting or remarketing. In March 2012, Im going to be speaking at Conversion Conference in San Fransisco soIve visited the site several times to review the agenda, register and make travel arrangements. Today, I noticed the following advertisement upon my visithere to Small Business Trends: This ad is targeted to me because Ive been to the site and have the cookie on my browser. Here is the technical explanation: According to a post by Inc.com last year, a . That means half of your visitors leave after viewing only one page. They say you only get one chance to make a first impression and a high bounce rate may indicate youre not making the best impression. However, utilizing remarketing allows you to make it up to them. Offer them a discount, remind them of your free offers, or emphasize different benefits. When creating your ads, be careful not to be creepy. While you may want to remind them that they were on your site, the average user doesnt understand how remarketing works. They just see your ads in places they might not expect it. And dont overdo the frequency. Most platforms, Google included, allow you to set a frequency cap so they only see your ad a certain number of times/day. This helps decrease the creepiness a lot. In the end, this is a chance to bring back some of the lost sheep that you worked so hard to get in the first place  even if it does require you to follow them around.","We are all looking .

According to the company, the new features will let its customers capture leads from social media, measure social-opt-ins, and give email recipients the ability to share newsletters and content on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+. According to Marc Chesley, Infusionsoft Vice President of Development and Technology, the tracking and analytics are unique features in the industry: A challenge that many businesses have with social media is that all too often your customer and prospect databases are disconnected from your followers and fans on social media  and disconnected from the conversations taking place on social media. So its no surprise that companies that provide CRM (customer relationship management) capabilities and marketing platforms and services such as email marketing, have been looking to add social media tools and monitoring/tracking capabilities. Its a . Companies providing social media tracking services and tools are sought-after acquisition targets.  In the email marketing space, .Constant Contact acquired and Nutshell Mail. ExactTarget bought Co-Tweet. Giant CRM provider social-media monitoring company Radian6 last year. Weve even seen some acquisitions go the other way. For instance, LinkedIn, itself a social media company, , a CRM provider, late last year. And those examples just scratch the surface of the acquisition activity thats going on to integrate marketing and social media capabilities. In a space where the buzzword seems to be acquire, Infusionsoft decided to buck the trend and build its own social media capabilities in-house, instead of acquiring them. This was a deliberate decision by Infusionsoft management, says the company, to provide exactly the right mix of capabilities that small businesses need. We conducted a full cycle of disciplined target user research to get clear on what benefits small businesses want from social media, explains Chesley. Overwhelmingly, small businesses told us that they want to use social media channels to generate hot leads for their business. The lines between software categories such as CRM, email marketing, social media monitoring/marketing are becoming blurrier with each day, as companies add capabilities.  For instance, Infusionsoft calls its product marketing automation software. The new social features provided by Infusionsoft are part of its winter release, which also includes added CRM and e-commerce capabilities. The new features are in the process of being rolled out at no additional charge to existing customers of Infusionsoft.","The U.S. Postal Service is lowering package rates  dramatically in some cases  in an effort to capture e-commerce business. The Postal Service has notified the Postal Regulatory Commission that it intends to change the cost of Priority Mail shipments. The changes would reduce the cost of Priority Mail shipping for high-volume customers, business customers, and those who utilize e-commerce shipping solutions. In an official statement on the rate proposal, Nagisa Manabe, the Postal Services chief marketing and sales officer, : Some of the highest-volume shipping customers with the U.S. Postal Service could save as much as 52 percent per shipment, . To get those discounts however, a business would have to send at least 50,000 packages per year. Still, the Postal Service will offer discounts on Priority Mail to business customers. The greater discounts on shipping are for packages going shorter distances. Most of the price reductions will be realized on packages weighing between 7 and 16 pounds and that dont require air travel to ship longer distances. The discounts will only be available for customers who use the Postal Servicess Commercial Base and Commercial Plus plans. The average discount on a Commercial Base shipment will be just less than 1 percent. Commercial Plus customers will get an average 2.3 percent shipping discount under the proposed rate structure. Commercial Base customers dont have any minimum shipping requirements. Reduced Priority Mail rates will be available for those shippers who use Click-N-Ship, PC Postage products, permit imprints, or digital mailing systems (meters) that generate an IBI (Information Based Indicia) and submit data electronically to the USPS, according to the official announcement from the Postal Service. As the Postal Service is aiming to attract more e-commerce business and other corporate customers, the new rates would impact consumers at the retail level. Priority Mail prices will actually increase if the shipping is purchased at a Post Office or some other retail location. The Postal Service says that, on average, Priority Mail rates would increase 1.7 percent. For instance, the rates for Priority Mail  purchased at a Post Office  would be $5.95 for a small box, $6.10 for a padded envelope, and $17.90 for a large box. Will new rates help smaller e-commerce businesses? Based on what the Postal Service is offering, smaller e-commerce businesses can expect to see a small reduction in rates. This is especially true if an online merchant uses the suggested services or something like Amazon fulfillment for their shipping. Amazon, which ships a much larger volume of packages per year, would presumably offer more reduced rates.","Twitter results have been showing up on Bing for some time. But now the search engine is adding tools that will refine that search. And that could be good news, if people happen to be looking for your Twitter handle on Bing. Bing has now introduced features that allow those using the service to lookfor a specific hashtag, (say, that really great Twitter chat you had last week, for example.) Theyll also be able to search for individual Twitter handles and trending topics. In a post about the new service on the official Bing Blogs, the Bing Team : Developers say several factors will figure into the ranking of a Twitter handle, hashtag or other content on Bing. Those factors include a tweets popularity, what Bing calls its freshness (more on this later) and the authority or importance of the person doing the tweeting. Among the signals the Bing team lists as helping to determine each of these factors are quality and again freshness. Here it appears that Bing plans to put more weight on a post with original content than on a retweet  which makes sense. But then, in terms of discovering popularity, it would seem the number of times others retweet your original message a factor. Finally, information on your profile coupled with whether or not it is a verified account, will factor into the authority, both of your account and of your tweets. Unfortunately, as implied at the end of the quote above, the focus of the new feature is mainly discussed from the standpoint of searching for celebrity and show biz related gossip. (Both Ashton Kutcher and The Daily Show, as seen above, are mentioned in the Bing Teams post.) As a result, its kind of hard to figure out how this will apply to searching for references to your business or brand on Bing. Add to this the fact that, despite some interesting features, Bing continues to account for only a fraction of online search. On the other hand, having handles and hashtags as a preference in a search other than Twitters creates more options. It should make small business Twitter users rethink the importance of their accounts and hashtags for marketing and branding.","The U.S. market will soon see one of its first curved smartphones.

No longer do we have to hire a taxi to take us to the airport, punch buttons trying to schedule a repairman to come fix a hole in the wall, or shell out what a moving service charges. is one of the companies leveraging this crowdsourcing . Essentially, the site connects people willing to do things like help people move, clean houses, repair things, or help with other personal tasks people need to get done. While the company has been in business since 2008 and expanded to 19 cities globally, the model wasnt perfect. Up until recently, the site operated on a bidding system: 1. You visit the site and post a job. 2. You wait and receive bids from service providers. 3. You choose the one that best fits what you want. Apparently, that model wasnt working for the brand, which is on track to bring in 2.5 million new clients this year. After in-depth research and analysis of its London operations  as well as ample feedback from users  TaskRabbit decided to to offer one-click hiring that takes the waiting for bids out of the equation. Taskers (those taking on the jobs) now post their hourly rate so that Clientscan easily see how much a task will cost and how long it will take to complete. Additionally, TaskRabbit realized that there were simply too many tasks for its Taskers to handle, so it came up with an innovative algorithm that matches users on both sides of the platform for the best fit. In an email interview Johnny Brackett, PR Lead at TaskRabbit told Small Business Trends: Given that there are over 25,000 Taskers using the platform, with 10 percent doing it as a full-time job and 75 percent relying on the brand to pay their bills, it was smart of TaskRabbit to listen to both Taskers and clients in its brand pivot. Taskers now have better communication and scheduling tools, as well as user-friendly mobile apps. TaskRabbit is also providing peace of mind to both sides of the equation with .

If youre like 5% of the small businesses that have a social media strategy, then you have a social media budget over $100,000 annually. But what if youre not part of the $100K club for social media budgets? Well, the fact is, most of your peers that are using social media have much lower budgets. The median budget for social media among those small businesses is far smaller  between $1,000 and $2,499 per year, as this weeks chart demonstrates: The data is from the conducted by the in mid-2012.

While 72 of the worlds largest 100 brands have a Google Plus page, nearly 40 percent of them havent posted any content on the site. But when you consider that Google Plus is the brainchild of the worlds most powerful search engine, is it really the brightest strategy to ignore Google Plus for business? Even though it might not be a major traffic driver like Pinterest or other social sites, Google Plus has some incredible benefits. The Business Insider recently reported that growth for Google Plus has suddenly spiked. In fact, the boom is so noticeable that Google Plus is on track to overtake Twitter as the worlds 2ndlargest social media site, assuming that the momentum doesnt slow. Up 33 percent with 359 million users, more people visit Google Plus on a regular basis than live in the United States. If theres anything that marketings taught us, its that you always want to be ahead of the curve  and right now the curve is favoring Google Plus for business. Aside from increased traffic, Mashable reports that Google Plus is also seeing an increase of time spent on the site. Users are now spending twice as much time on Google Plus than they did in February and the trend doesnt appear to be slowing anytime soon. As more and more people spend time on the site, the more powerful traffic driver this platform will become. Having a Google Plus account allows you to claim authorship of your original content. This keeps your unique and original content valuable and accredited to you, even if content thieves scrape your work. Furthermore, the implementation of Google Plus means that links and referrals will be weighted based on who they come from instead of where theyre posted. Authorship gives you credibility and power. It goes without saying that a strong Google Plus presence directly correlates to stronger search engine recognition. While it cant replace solid SEO strategy, why not enhance your efforts? Whether you want to host Google Hangouts or filter posts for your Circles, Google Plus provides flexibility options that many of the other platforms dont. By taking advantage of these features, youre making your brands online presence unique from everyone elses. To make your Google Plus page even more effective, be sure to incorporate profile links. Unlike other social platforms, you can link to other sites throughout your Google Plus profile, thereby strengthening your overall sales funnel. As more people engage with you by sharing and giving you posts a +1, your profile links will suddenly become powerful tools. Be sure to optimize your Google Plus title tags for search engine results. Having a highly optimized Google Plus page is much easier to rank than a standalone website. Add a picture to your profile and through Authorship. Posts with pictures are clicked on up to 5 percent more than posts without. Once youve optimized your Google Plus presence, you can enjoy Googles bias in quickly indexing posts that have received a+1.","  US based ad tech startup AdPushup , creator of a patent pending ad layout optimization platform, has secured an undisclosed amount of financing as part of its Series A round led by Geniee , Inc., whose major shareholder is SoftBank Group Corp .

The term small is based on the value of a companys assets, number of employees, number of owners, gross receipts, or something else. Using different standards to define small business makes it very challenging to know when a company may or may not qualify for a tax break. There are many and beloware 10 of thesedefinitions: One of the hottest IRS issues is whether employers are properly classifying workers as employees or independent contractors. If the IRS challenges an employers classification, its usually up to the company to prove the classification was correct. However, the burden can be shifted to the IRS under certain conditions. This applies to small businesses, which means those with a net worth of business not exceeding $7 million. Companies that fail to file required information returns are penalized. The longer they go without filing, the greater the penalty. However, penalties are capped for small businesses. Small means that the business has average annual gross receipts of no more than $5 million for a 3-year period. As in the case of providing correct worker classification, its up to a company to prove that compensation it pays to an employee is reasonable in order to deduct it. However, the burden of proof can be shifted to the IRS if the employer is small, which means having a net worth not in excess of $7 million. An employer that starts a qualified retirement plan can take a tax credit of up to $500 for the first 3 years of the plan to cover the costs of employee education and certain other administrative costs. This credit applies only if the company has no more than 100 employees with compensation over $5,000 in the preceding year. These are entities organized under state law that offer owners personal liability protection. From a federal (and usually state) income tax basis, if the corporation makes an election, its profits and losses pass through to owners and are taxed on their personal returns. S corporations can have no more than 100 shareholders. Self-employed individuals or businesses can use a type of retirement plan that limits employer contributions and avoids annual reporting. These plans, called SIMPLE IRAs, are available only for those with 100 or fewer employees who received at least $5,000 in compensation in the preceding year. Cafeteria plans allow employers to offer their staff a menu of employee benefits from which they can choose benefits or cash. These plans are deemed to meet nondiscrimination standards in the tax laws as long as they satisfy certain conditions. Simple cafeteria plans can be used only if a small business has 100 or fewer employees on business days during either of the 2 preceding years. To encourage small businesses to offer or continue health coverage for their staff, the tax law offers a 50 percent tax credit for company-paid premiums as long as certain conditions are met. This credit applies only if there are no more than 25 full-time equivalent employees (the full credit applies only for companies with up to 10 such employees). However, there are also caps on the wages that these employees can receive to make the company eligible for the credit. The sale of qualified small business stock presents two opportunities: (1) deferral for gain if the proceeds of the sale are reinvested in other small business stock, or (2) an exclusion for some or all of the gain (depending upon the exclusion percentage, which is set by law, that is in effect when the stock is acquired). These breaks apply only to C corporation stock issued by a company with gross assets of no more than $50 million when the stock is issued and immediately thereafter. The uniform capitalization (UNICAP) rules are an accounting method that requires certain costs to be capitalized and recovered through depreciation rather than simply claiming a current deduction. However, small businesses are exempt from these rules. Small means having average annual gross receipts of no more than $10 million for a 3-year period. Just because you qualify as a small business for one tax break, dont assume you also qualify for other size-based deductions, credits, and other special tax rules exclusive to small businesses. Check eligibility. Ask your tax advisor.","Investing.com Gold is also rallying. Gold just had a huge month.

And if you ask bestselling author Gary Vaynerchuk ( on Twitter), hell tell you the instances of considering earlier experiences and how much the service provider cared, when deciding on future purchases, are blossoming. His new book, , explains how this notion has become an online movement that rethinks business value offline. If you were a bit overpowered by one of Garys intense online orations during his first books promotion ( ), youll see a slightly softer speaking tone this time. Its more like that seen on MSNBCs Morning Joe (see a video here). I noticed it listening to him at a Barnes and Noble Tribeca book signing, which is where I picked up a copy of . No less passionate, Vaynerchuk just has a different and very informed intensity. You will experience this tone while reading . Vaynerchuk addresses 11 typical company hesitancies with deepening the customer connection using social media. He does not advocate specific tools, but digs into corporate concerns about return on investment, message control and consumer backlash. Check out his comment on the need for controlling the message: Vaynerchuk offers compelling support through data and large business examples. When customers complained that Ann Taylor LOFTs new cargo pants looked good only on models, not real-sized women, Ann Taylor showed photos of its employees wearing the pants. The result?  tons of comments from women thanking LOFT for listening . One customer did not like the pants, according to Vaynerchuk, but she respected how Ann Taylor LOFT handled the complaints. Although he focuses on social medias importance, Vaynerchuk tries to avoid rehashing other social media authors. On page 5 he claims the term is a misnomer of the new economic movement. Some points will sound similar, however, if youve read anything from those aforementioned authors. But Vaynerchuk asserts that businesses are being humanized by social media, and such reimagined roles will become the essential way of doing business.

Brantley does African hair braiding. Her passion is to preserve African culture in the African-American community. And she does this, in large part, by braiding hair in Dallas. For nearly 20 years Brantley has been both practicing the art of African hair braiding and teaching it to others so that they could do the same. But her efforts to operate a school to share her knowledge were being impeded. The problem was the state of Texas and it onerous laws. The state wanted to put Brantley through the regulatory wringer. Officials wanted to force her to comply with the same rules applying to starting a cosmetology or barber school. In 2013, Brantley sued the state in order to be excluded from those regulations, the Dallas Morning News .A ruling from U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks, from the West District of Texas, has backed Brantley and any other would-be hair braider. Texas law would have forced Brantley to comply with rules including having at least 10 student workstations in her school. It would have also required providing a working sink behind every other workstation. In addition, she and any other African hair braider would also need more than 2,000 square feet in which to operate. Brantley says there are no sinks required to braid hair. In fact, hair braiding licenses in Texas specifically prohibit the use of a sink.In his ruling, Judge Sparks called the states demands irrational and unconstitutional addressing no public health or safety concerns, The Dallas Morning News reports. Brantley celebrated her victory and the Texas judges ruling. In a statement released by the , which represented her in the case, she said: Brantley also tweeted and posted to her Facebook page: The decision will not only benefit Brantley, who can now continue to operate her school, but opens the door for others to do the same. In the Institute of Justices official release, Arif Panju, an attorney with the firm, explained: her website, Brantley was first arrested in 1997 for braiding hair without an official license from the state to do so. The state wanted her to become a licensed cosmetologist and attend a school before making money as a hair braider. Brantley says that at the time of her arrest in 1997, it wasnt even required to carry a license to braid hair in Texas. She countered that her craft could not be taught in one of the cosmetology schools the state had in mind.","Government contracts for small businesses were discussed this week on Capitol Hill. U.S. Rep. Sam Graves (R-MO) asked the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday to include more contracting for small businesses in a defense spending bill for 2015. Graves serves as chairman of the House Committee on Small Business. Graves testified before the committee that a bill he proposed should be included in the National Defense Authorization Act. The act is a law passed annually specifying budget and expenditures for the U.S. Department of Defense. Graves introduced the earlier this year. The bill as written would give small businesses more opportunities to compete for federal government contract work. It has been the goal of the federal government to award at least 23 percent of its sub-contracted work to small businesses. But government agencies have historically fallen short of that goal. Graves legislation actually calls for an increase on that 23 percent goal to 25 percent of all contract work going to small businesses. In addition, Graves also asked the House Armed Services Committee to include another bill that would de-bundle larger government contracts. When some contracts are bundled together, that often leaves small businesses feeling unable to compete for the work. Asking the House Armed Services Committee for help in his fashion is not new. In fact, small business legislation has often looked for support in the House Armed Services Committee. In a statement following his testimony to the committee, Graves : In the past, the House Small Business and Armed Forces committees have teamed to better fund small businesses through government contract work. This has included offering incentives and bonuses to federal employees when contracts are awarded to small businesses. Also, according to Graves, the committees have joined forces to better ensure that larger companies dont use fronts to procure government contracts posing as small businesses.","Mike Kelley And, crude oil rallied to its highest level since June, just a few cents shy of $50 per barrel, after weekly data showed an unexpected drop in inventories.

While the company can work with both bloggers and brands in a variety of industries, it specializes in pet-related blogs and the brands that target that niche. And, as such, the company always has to keep the welfare of animals at the top of its priority list. DiVita explains: As a conference for pet bloggers. DiVita was at a womens blogging conference when her co-founder, Caroline Golon, brought up the idea of doing the same type of conference for pet bloggers. Even with a lack of experience, they jumped right into the idea. DiVita says: The first conference was successful so the business bloomed from there. Hosting a second conference in the same year. DiVita says: Luckily, the second conference, which was held in Denver so that those who couldnt travel to the first conference in Columbus, Ohio, could attend, was also successful. So, their gut feelings were right. Having the ability to help animals in need. The keynote speakers at each conference dont collect speaking fees. Instead, BlogPaws donates to a shelter of each speakers choice. And even without the ability to collect speaking fees, the company is able to attract quality speakers just because they all have a shared goal. DiVita explains: Online marketing is incredibly important. Though the business has been successful to this point, the founders sort of jumped in without learning as much about the ins and outs of things, like marketing, first.

And with that comes the opportunity for us to focus in on the hottest trends of the upcoming New Year, and maybe even those that eluded us in years prior. While youre putting the finishing touches on your action plan for 2012, lets dig into some of the hot Internet trends for SMBs to watch over the next 12 months. After all, you want to kick off the New Year on the right foot, dont you? Of course you do. It was during Novembers PubCon Vegas show that distinguished Google engineer Matt Cutts stood in front of a packed room and encouraged search marketers to over the next year: While these areas were certainly hot in 2011, the data shows theyre only going to heat up from here. The year 2011 saw a in the number of mobile searches, with 74 percent of people using their mobile phones to search while running errands. For Black Friday this year we even saw advertisers attempting to lure customers away and steal competitor sales while they were , as reports Piggybacking off the explosion of mobile are social networks trying to get in on the action. Mashable reports Facebook just to help them tie proximity to intent, while SearchEngineLand reports FourSquare recently released the new FourSquare button to to help customers find you before they even realized a need was there. Its awareness through relevance and, if youre a small business owner, its a fantastic way to appeal to new customers. In the face of the SoLoMo revolution, SMBs must not only adapt to new screens but also to new ways of reaching customers. Focusing on online reviews is not new, but in 2012 its continued importance will be driven by two impressive factors. : A showed us that 63 percent of social media users list consumer ratings as their preferred source for getting information about a business, product or service. Data shared by Gregg Stewart during Marchs SMX West event told us that 32 percent of all searches . And when they dont, they wonder: Once theyre done with the why questions, they simply go search for a business that have this information available. : Its not just consumers who love online reviews; so does Google. Google looks at reviews as just one of many social signals that will bring accountability back into their algorithm. Google is so serious about accountability and social signals that they even built a new social network around it called Google+. Here consumers are forced to interact on the Web using their real names and identities. That changes the types of interactions that are taking place. Search engines want to return the best possible experience, and an increased focus on social signals is one way theyre looking to do that. The combination of users looking for this type of social data and Google wanting to display it is a clear sign that SMBs need to invest in this area. In 2012, the SMBs that will be left behind will the ones who have not developed a strategy for how theyll solicit online reviews, how theyll manage them, and how they will respond to negative reviews that pop up around their businesses. Cloud computing alternatives will continue to go mainstream in the upcoming year, RingCentral says, as SMBs look to save money and gain access to resources they wouldnt have otherwise. If youre not familiar with the term, refers to using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store and manage data instead of hosting it on your local server. For example, instead of hosting your email on your personal computer, if you use Gmail, they host it for you. Or maybe you use to store your media instead of putting it on a local server at your office. The benefits of moving into the cloud are obvious: Through the use of cloud computing, SMBs can run their businesses more smoothly thanks to established infrastructure they dont have to build (or pay for) on their own. Of course, moving into the cloud does pose some issues. For example, check out the next big trend for 2012 Yes, with more businesses using Web-based services and with hackers shifting their attacks to smaller firms, site security is a major issues for SMBs in 2012. Hackers are setting their eyes on small computer users who they know will have weaker security systems in place and who, The Huffington Post reports, still think . Only it can. And it is. If you think your SMB is safe from hacking because you have nothing worth stealing, think again. Even a local pizza joint that delivers will have access to tens of dozens, maybe hundreds, of street addresses and credit card numbers. And thats all the hackers are after. Protect yourself by putting basic security measures in place like changing default passwords often, setting up strong firewalls, and not falling prey to the kinds of phishing scams or malicious emails that Security News reports. What else has the proliferation of smart phones done besides make us all mobile-crazy? Its also driven us . And its not just Facebook, Twitter and Angry Birds, either. Were turning to apps to help us run our businesses and be more efficient and, we hope, more profitable. For example: The adoption of business applications will allow SMBs to streamline tasks and do more faster and easier. Those are the five hot Internet trends I think small business owners should be aware of in 2012. Are you ready?","Bill Jelen didnt exactly need to crowdfund his latest book, MrExcel XL Book  The 40 Greatest Excel Tips of All Time. But he did see it as a great opportunity to reconnect with his online network. And since his 40thbook provided such a great naming opportunity (XL is the Roman numeral for 40), he saw it as an opportunity to present a milestone book, complete with full color printing on glossy paper. All in all, Jelens Indiegogo raised $25,183, which is more than 1,000percentof its original $2,000 goal. Through the experience, Jelen learned a few valuable lessons about crowdfunding that could help you with future campaigns. A few of them are included below. When Jelen first decided to go the crowdfunding route, he attempted to sign up with Kickstarter. But the platform required a lot of information including bank statements and documents from the Secretary of State. Jelen had some issues with Kickstarter authenticating all of his documents and information. All of the back and forth took too long and caused him to lose interest in Kickstarter. But he had much different results when he decided to switch. Jelen said: Thats not to say that you shouldnt use Kickstarter. But there are other options out there. Consider which one might be best for you and your offering before committing to one. In addition to crowdfunding the book, Jelen also crowdsourced many of the tips included in the book. That means that the people who provided tips were really invested in the project. He even used the opportunity to collaborate as an incentive for contributing to the campaign. In order to get people interested in the project, Jelen obviously had to get the word out. But just posting a general Tweet or Facebook post doesnt always guarantee results. So to get his message across, Jelen identified some of his more engaged Twitter followers and Tweeted at them directly. Ivana Taylor of , who hosted a Google Hangout with Jelen, explained why this is an important tactic: In addition, Jelen was careful to try and reach people when they would be likely to actually see his Tweets. To do this, he came up with a Twitter hack that he in detail. Basically, he charted out his engaged followers in Excel, determined their time zones, and tweeted at each of them around 8 a.m. in their time zone. He explained: At 8 a.m., a lot of people are just sitting down with a cup of coffee and might take a few moments to browse through their social media apps. So Jelen figured that would be an effective time to start a conversation with them. As mentioned above, the rewards for this campaign definitely had an impact on its success. Jelen offered a few different reward levels. He recommends offering something in the $5-10 range, something in the $50-100 range, and something really special and exclusive. The rewards for this campaign included an autographed copy of the book, the opportunity to collaborate, and the opportunity to advertise in the book, among others. Aside from being aware of the Mr. Excel brand already, those perks provided the main incentives for people to contribute to the campaign. Jelen explained: In addition, Jelen suggested leaving a few of the perks empty at the beginning (Indiegogo allows 12 active perks at once). Throughout his campaign, he received suggestions for unique perks that he was able to add at different points. Jelen was also very deliberate with his financial goal. Though he entered a goal of $2,000, he was really hoping to raise at least $14,000 from the beginning. He knew that Indiegogo charged a higher fee for projects that didnt meet their goals. So instead of taking the risk, he went for the bare minimum $2,000, which would cover an upgrade to color printing. Then when he reached that goal quickly, he also had the added benefit of his project looking extremely popular. And it allowed him to raise even more than his $14,000 goal to cover all of the custom artwork. In addition, he recommends that people consider the timing of their campaigns carefully. He originally launched a 10-day campaign to create a sense of urgency. But since it was around the holidays, he noticed a lot of the people he contacted were out of their offices or on vacation. So he ended up stretching it to 21 days. Many of the tips above are things that businesses can put into practice during or just before launching a crowdfunding campaign. But in reality, the preparations must start a lot earlier. There were a lot of things that went into making the Mr. Excel XL Book campaign a success. But if Jelen didnt already have a huge network of followers that he actually engaged with, along with 39 other books that people have actually bought and benefited from, it wouldnt have been as successful. A brand new business with relatively unknown founders would not have all those channels to reach out to when asking for contributions. Though every project is different, it certainly helps to have those connections and name recognition on your side. Taylor said:","Apple can do it. Why cant you? The tech giant to build a $2 billion solar powered command center in Arizona. And the move is viewed as part of a larger trend. More companies are investing in renewable energy (energy derived from natural resources) to fuel their operations. But you dont need to be a high tech heavy weight to participate. Smaller businesses can benefit from a renewable energy focus, which doesnt always require you to spend billions or even millions of dollars, says , which designs renewable energy systems. In an email interview with Small Business Trends, Matt James, applications engineering manager at OutBack Power, has 20 tips for transitioning to renewable energy. There are numerous reasons to consider renewable energy. It reducesa businesss utility bills and helps save on energy costs. At the same time it allows a company to reduce its carbon footprint, meaning it operates in an environmentally friendly way. Investing in a renewable energy system can help you boost your companys reputation and advance your position as a local leader, James says. Adopting renewable energy probably doesnttop your colleagues and stakeholdersagendas. However, getting their support at the beginning will help ensure that the transition to renewable energy runs smoothly. Remind them that renewable energy is an investment. They can expect to see returns in terms of cost, environmental savings and reputation within the first few years, James notes. Learn everything you can about renewable energy. It can benefit your company in multiple ways. You need to identify precisely how it can, which will save you headaches later. James advises that you speak to other businesses in your region that have undertaken renewable energy projects, read industry publications, and determine your states particular renewable energy policies. Chances are you can even find a local installer to explain the fundamentals but youd have to pay for the service, of course. So many variables are involved with renewable energy regional policies, the infrastructure, project scale and other thingsthat offering a baseline cost-of-entry estimate is impossible. You definitely need to plan ahead by getting an estimate and then budget accordingly. Any budget you allocate toward renewable energy is truly an investment from which youll see returns and a payback, James notes. But you still need the upfront capital to get started. Renewable energys growth as an industry has created a demand for local contractors that install renewable energy systems. But before jumping to hire the first one you meet, talk to them and inquire about whether theyve worked on similar projects previously. You also need to determine if theyre certified to install the type of system and technology you want. You might also want to speak with some of their previous customers. Most of all, make sure the installer is someone you can trust, since he or she will be your partner throughout the entire process, James says. A great way to begin the process of finding an installer is to consult (NABCEP). NABCEP-certified installers are highly capable of meeting your needs, James advises. Knowing what to expect from renewable energy will help you set realistic expectations regarding how your system performs, as well as your return on investment. The installer can help you clearly define your goals, whether it is independence from the grid, cutting your energy costs during peak hours or ensuring consistent power during outages. How your business uses energy will help you and the installer determine the appropriate system for you. You need to assess how many kilowatt hours (KwH) your company uses per year. You also should determine the critical energy loads (lighting, computer, etc.) for your business. These factors will assist you in picking the proper system. A good installer will help you perform the necessary energy audit to plan ahead. Is your small business located in asunny region or a snowy one? A solar-energy system thrives in any weather condition, but some important factors need to beconsideredto find renewable energy systems that make the best sense. Solar energy is the most popular renewable energy format. Still, even within the solar category, there are a number of options to configure a system. Also many different technologies can be incorporated. Based on your goals, your climate and your businesss energy requirements, work with your installer to choose the best system for you. An array of local, utility, state, and federal incentives and tax breaks are available for companies that adopt renewable energy. Investigate what is accessible and take full advantage. Once you know which system to implement, an installer will work with you to price out the components and service costs. You also need to work with the installer to get cost estimates from the various technology vendors. The prices range, but you need to focus on quality. The key is to determine which products will deliver a quality system that will perform optimally and endure. This is critical to realizing a return on your investment. Once you hire an installer and have established a budget and plan, you next need to create a timeline including key milestones. Moving swiftly is always preferred, but its important to carefully develop a timeline to allow for an effective installation that meets expectations. Depending on your location and the utility companies powering your grid, you may face rules and regulations. You need to find out. These guidelines need to be followed to build, install and connect an alternative energy system. Talk to your installer and regulatory bodies to ensure you have the necessary permits before you begin. A snag or issue is inevitable. At certain times, your installer will need answers before they can continue. Make sure you are available throughout the duration of the project. Dont let a minor problem blossom into a major issue. Putting your company on a renewable energy footing is something to be proud of. When the system is ready to go live, its time to celebrate. Invite the local press to your office and pop the champagne! Components sometimes need repair. Talk to your installer about required maintenance. Also get information from other local vendors that can help when problems arise. Be prepared by understanding the range of problems you might face and knowing which solutions are available. Your installer likely will use monitoring and control software and related devices to monitor your system. The installer may need to perform occasional adjustments. These reduce the likelihood of emergency service calls,but if you ever need to make one, you know whats entailed. The benefits of renewable energy wont be obvious in the short term. But they will arrive. Be patient and give it time. Be sure you have a system in place for documenting cost and energy savings. This will help you justify the investment to company stakeholders. You can also share the data with employees, other businesses and the local media. Keep all your employees updated on your progress. Maybe use your monthly newsletter to discuss how much the company saved last month. Also, share your updates on social media and make sure regional trade organizations, as well as customers and partners, are informed as well. You spent a lot of time working on your renewable energy project. And youvespent a lot of time and resources implementing the appropriate program for your company in the best possible way. Theres no shame in self-promotion. Tell your PR team to get on the phone and call websites and local media. Dont forget the trade publications that cover your industry. Tell all of them about your companys experience and the benefits you accrue. This helps position you as a local leader and inspires other companies to follow the good example you set.","How does the owner of a home-based business manage to be successful in international eCommerce, moving a half million dollars worth of product through her living room each year? With smart marketing and the right kind of help, thats how. Nicole Snow of has grown her business from nothing in 2008 to a successful international business in six years. And its still growing. The company sells yarn  but that mundane statement hardly tells its story. Darn Good Yarn is a socially-conscious business with a mission and reflects the owners passion to change the world one exotic, beautiful texture at a time. Darn Good Yarn employs over 300 poverty-stricken women in India and Nepal. The company collects and recycles silk from waste fibers collected from sari manufacturing factories. The yarn is then individually hand spun and dyed into unique yarns. The women who help create this yarn from recycled waste fibers are able to make enough money to keep their children in school and to feed their families three meals a day. Snownotes that they perform a very tedious job to ensure the quality of our yarn.Without the added income, they and their children would be reduced to begging in the streets, Snow says. Its not just about the dedicated workers in India and Nepal. Its also about the technology used and the advice and support she received while growing her business. Snow moved her website platform to Shopify, a cloud-based eCommerce platform, and says she was surprised at how easy it was to move to cloud technology. But that was just the start. She then integrated her website with shipping options from FedEx, her shipper of choice. I was able to call up a tech assistant to get my FedEx account working with my Shopify account. I had a FedEx employee working with me to make my Shopify account work with FedEx. But the biggest bang comes from using FedEx as a strategic advisor. Snow has regular calls each quarter with her representative to discuss regular quarterly reviews of her progress and to do brainstorming for future expansion. I look for my FedEx account rep to give me strategy help. For example, well look at our domestic ground shipments. Well break down the data and my rep may recommend how I could use a certain type of shipping and save money next quarter. That help from FedEx was important when expanding internationally. As a result of advice from her FedEx rep, she says. We were able to test a bit as to how best to get my products into new geographical markets. Im saving about $100 on every single shipment to my distributor to Australia. That $100 per shipment drops directly to the bottom line profits, and its enabled growth. Snow says shes planning a similar strategy to improve shipping to the Netherlands. This year compared to lastyear weve nearly doubled our international business, said Snow. According to Adam Hamburger, marketing manager at FedEx, this kind of assistance is part of FedExs approach to working with small businesses. We try to make sure were easy to do business with. We provide self-serve support online, but also provide someone a business owner can call. The company has free tools on its to help small businesses manage and grow their business. For instance, the has profiles of different countries including demographics, helps estimate customs and duties, and helps locate the necessary international documents for shipments to help them grow internationally. Hamburger adds that FedEx views its mission not just as being about shipping from point A to point B, but also giving guidance and input in terms of how entrepreneurs run their businesses. By assigning the business a FedEx account rep and holding quarterly sessions with the business owner, the rep comes to understand the business and what the owner is trying to accomplish. That way FedEx can be of more help to the small business. The story of Snows success is so compelling that Darn Good Yarn won a $25,000 FedEx Small Business Grant. It was like magic that we won, Snow said. She intends to use the money as a line of credit to close on commercial property in central New York. Without the money it would have taken another 18 months to get liquidity. Operations, technology, infrastructure and people are crucial to success, but it takes more than that. You need a thriving customer base. Snow says her company has had to learn to get good at marketing. The company uses email marketing, has built a 13,000-subscriber email list and boasts an open rate of over 60%. We also maintain a strong social media presence, Snow adds. Facebook, for instance, plays a key role. Darn Good Yarns Facebook Page has over 60,000 fans. Snow says they she will put out an email but then tie it into her Facebook strategy by asking people to come over on Facebook and interact with the business there. Word of mouth also has played a huge role in Darn Good Yarns growth. Snow says she thinks word of mouth works equally well for an online business as an offline business. Of course, having great products and great customer service is important if you want to get people talking  but a small business can increase word of mouth simply by asking. For example, she includes a note with each shipment saying, Packed with love by Nicole xoxo and explains how the company got started, asking the customer to share with a friend. Snow and Hamburger of FedEx offer four tips for other small business owners trying to grow and expand: These can include people who are paid (such as your bookkeeper). Others may be mentors who are not necessarily paid. But Snow advises not to simply rely on friends since they may not be as invested in your success. Dont be afraid to pay for advice, she says. I am not afraid to ask for help. No one can know everything, so creating a network that can help you is critical, Hamburger says. Dont just think in terms of peers and colleagues. That network should include suppliers, vendors and manufacturers you use in your business. They may have tools and expertise to help. Snow is a big proponent of this tool to help clarify your business model and where you need to focus your time. A business owner might not think through their inventory strategy up front, Hamburger points out. But spending time on this early will pay off, because you develop a better direction to take the business in.","Im introduced to new Web sites every day. A friend will send me an article to read or someone will post an interesting link on Twitter and Ill click through. And after Im done reading the information I was sent there for, my next click is on the About page. Your About page serves many purposes.  It gives visitors important information about you, its a , it introduces them to your site and your company and its what differentiates you from all the other companies like you on the Web. If a site has a weak About page (or they dont have one at all), Im probably not going to come back.  If its compelling, well, they may just have a friend for life. And Im not alone in that! Your About page is what allows people to get to know you.  Its your introduction and their chance to look behind the curtain to see what lies beneath.  You wouldnt go to a party and stand around not introducing yourself, so why commit the same act on your site?  Dont forget your About page. When youre coming up with your About page, there are a few things youll want to include: Your About page is one of the most important elements of your Web site.  Its your introduction to your customers and often one of their first points of contact with you.  Make sure youre doing it justice and .","Every Internet entrepreneur knows the importance of good Internet hosting, and the misery that can ensue when hosting problems occur. Heck, just look at our recent coverage of the problems experienced by when he briefly lost two of his domains for several days last week. Its important to know as much as you can about your hosting company before making the decision where to host your Website. Be sure you are getting the services you need. . Once a darling of the Internet entrepreneurial community, Go Daddy has experienced some shakeups in management recently. The company announced that CEO Warren Adelman had stepped down after just 8 months on the job, and will be replaced by Scott Wagner of KKR Capstone, a major investor in the company. . Earlier last month, Go Daddy seemed to be bolstering its offerings to its small business clientele, acquiring automated accounting application company Outright with plans to add financial management features to its Web hosting and domain name registration services. . Before his departure, former Go Daddy CEO Adelman talked about the reasons for the Outright acquisition. Go Daddy makes domain name signup and hosting simple, while Outright focuses on making it easy to combine data from e-commerce sites like eBay, Etsy, and Amazon, invoicing Web sites like Freshbooks and Harvest, and receipts sites like Shoeboxed. Both are hyper focused on supporting online small business. . The ultimate aim for Go Daddy, said Adelman recently, is to move from a simple Web hosting and domain registration company to a sort of one stop shop for entrepreneurs seeking to create an online business. That shop offers Web marketing tools, e-commerce functions, SEO and social media marketing assistance, accounting, and more. . But no matter how much effort might be placed behind making hosting a safe and easy process, business owners must always remember that the security of their site is their own responsibility. Here blogger Tuan Do makes some suggestions for protecting your online security without leaving everything up to your Web hosting company. . Of course, hosting possibilities go far beyond simply getting a Website online in this era of cloud computing. Microsoft, for example, has introduced a version of its Windows Azure cloud platform, which allows the companys partners to offer business customers an infrastructure-as-a-service experience including deployment of many different applications. . Meanwhile Dell has partnered with hosting automation software Parallels to provide its business users with a hosted Microsoft Office 365 offering. The Dell announcement means that business customers of the computer company will be able to use features like email, shared calendars, document creating and editing tools, instant messaging, Web conferencing, and internal team Websites through computers, tablets, smartphones.","Microsoft has joined the ranks for the top 5 tablet sellers according to research firm IDC. The Redmond, Washington based tech giant sold 900,000 units and had 1.8% market share for the first quarter of 2013. Now it might sound as if 1.8% market share isnt much to crow about. Keep in mind, though, that a year earlier Microsoft had zero market share. Even more telling is Apples drop. A year ago it had 58% market share of shipments. This year in the first quarter of 2013 Apple shipments made up just 39% market share. Most of Microsofts tablet sales came from the Surface Pro, which uses the Windows 8 operating system and targets business users. An interesting factoid from IDC is that the more expensive Surface Pro made up a large amount of the 900,000 total Surface units. The Surface Pro first went on sale in the U.S. and Canada in February, and Microsoft has plans to expand it even further across the world to 25 countries in May, . Microsoft products appeal to business users. And the is a business tablet. One of the advantages of a Surface Pro over other tablets is the ability to use Microsoft Office programs you might use at work, such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint. You dont need to learn a new operating system if youre using Windows 8 on your desktop computer. Equally attractive for business users is the hardware. The Surface Pro straddles the line between laptop and tablet.Theres a built-in stand, and a snap-on keyboard that doubles as a cover. And it comes with a stylus so you can draw, select items or make handwritten notes. And thats exactly the kind of business tablet that business people need. Tablets that are mainly navigated through touch are great for browsing and playing games. They are ill suited for work such as creating and editing documents. MyGoogle Nexus 10 (made by Samsung) is light enough to hold with one hand and slip into my tote bag. It is terrific for watching videos and reading the news. But trying to write a business document or create a post with it is frustratingly slow. Nor can I edit a PowerPoint presentation or an Excel spreadsheet. Microsoft has an effective television ad campaign going on now for the Surface Pro that I have to believe is helping raise awareness. The ad features businesspeople (actually professional dancers) doing a dance while sitting around a conference table. The music is catchy and upbeat. The ad conveys that meetings can be fun and exciting, not dull and boring  IF you have a business tablet like the Surface Pro. The ad flashes quickly to the Surface Pro tablet being used forbusinesspurposes. Those few quick flashes are enough. We business users already know what kind of applications Microsoft offers  we dont need more. have the ad  I could not disagree more. Perhaps to a geek the commercial seems old fashioned. But from the perspective of a business user, the ad is energetic, memorable and manages to say quite a bit about what the Surface Pro tablet can do for business users  all in 30 seconds. The 30-second version showing on television now has better business focus than the longer online version embedded below, because it leaves out the distracting middle part with the beatbox. The ad speaks to business people, just as the Surface Pro itself speaks to business people.","It was a place for big ideas. Leaders in the small business community gathered for the VIP dinner at Infusionsofts massive ICON15 Small Business Conference March 31 through April 2 in Phoenix, Arizona. And none other than Infusionsoft Co-Founder and CEO Clate Mask addressed the group as the festivities got under way. The setting was a picturesque location set against the backdrop of the majestic Desert Botanical Gardens. And the atmosphere seemed a perfect one in which to reflect. Surrounded by the inspiring beauty of the great Arizona desert, Small Business Trends took a few moments to interview some of the movers and shakers who had come to the conference. Were seeing this nascent industry forming around customer engagement. Now its top of mind in business. The technology is starting to come together. CRM is going to be a piece of that industry. You want to talk about movin, its non-stop movin. Mobile and marketing and convergence of advertising technology and marketing technology . . . all on a device. And it doesnt matter how big or small your company is, you better start doing it or it wont be long before youre left behind. Theres a seismic shift. Everythings happening so quickly. Whats new today is old by the end of the day. Keeping up and trying to figure out which things do (small businesses) really go into and which things they wait on, thats what has everybody shaking right now. The sophistication and accessibility of smartphones for recording and documenting things today is a real-time, in-the-moment experience that is absolutely phenomenal. No matter whats happening, you can click on your smartphone and capture it. Its becoming a super major marketing tool. Video is still something that is very strong but I think the trend for me is this desire for people to see authentic, personal, real presentations by people talking about their experiences. Consumers have taken to mobile. They search on their phones. They search on their tablets. They buy. mCommerce numbers are amazing. Small business is kind of lagging behind there but you have no choice but to catch up because its being led by consumers. Youd better go mobile now. You dont have time to wait. A lot more small businesses are getting started because of Obamacare. People are no longer tied to their job. Theyre free to go out and do what they want and not worry that theyre not going to get health insurance. The nature of work really has changed. You can work with the best people all over the world for a short period of time. Thats making it easier to build a powerful small business. Its an exciting time to be an entrepreneur. We create content that inspires, educates, and informs. Were bridging the gap for a lot of entrepreneurs that feel that entrepreneurship is not as accessible. Were providing the actual access to experts with subject matter expertise. I feel there is definitely a groundswell in the small business ecosystem when were talking about women and entrepreneurship. Womens collaboration is so important. When we do, we become a powerful force in the small business ecosystem. I think this is the year where people are starting to understand the value of content and how important that is to their business. Its taking that and bringing it full circle. Tying all of the pieces together (content, social media) is really big for people. As soon as they do that, they see a lot more value. Marketers have had to lose control of the message. Now, you have to rely on the community and you have to give them solid assets. They can do whatever with it. You give up ownership and you have to hope theyre going to speak well of you. Its just a different way of thinking about marketing. In Australia, specifically, its about how much support small businesses are getting from the government. When it comes to tax time and when it comes to how much interest or what regulations there are  red tape  that tends to be the biggest issue small businesses are really experiencing. Theres a real go-get-em attitude. Its the younger generation. Theyre really getting involved. Everyone is going online to make their businesses. In terms of the digital age, thats where its at. Thats what makes it so much easier for entrepreneurs right now. Were getting all kinds of website-based or cloud-based solutions that are leading the entrepreneurial spirit right now. One of our passion projects that weve been working on for several years now called   has really taken it to the next level. Its really something that we started because my brothers daughter, who is eight years old, didnt really understand the basic principles of entrepreneurship. So we tried to find a book or a program that spoke to the kids about entrepreneurship. And really there was nothing out there that really taught these kids those basic principles of entrepreneurship. So we decided, were going towrite a book. So we wrote the book called Kidpreneurs. And it recently surpassed 100,000 copies sold. We just bought Infusionsoft ourselves. Whats exciting to me is implementing it into our business and seeing what it can do. Were looking to start segmenting our email lists. We found that by doing targeted pop-ups that are hyper-related to the page that the users on, we can up our conversion rate to four or five percent. Infusionsofts ability to trigger different events based on that and send customized campaigns to people is really big for us. Mobile is very hot. Small and medium businesses have really glommed on to using more and more mobile apps. The problem is theyre getting to the point where its kind of chaotic and theyre having problems managing them and securing them. Were using all this mobile stuff in our business, now how do we manage it? Were doing a lot of exciting stuff with influencers and major media hubs. Something were doing now is the Main Street Forum with Infusionsoft. And were bringing together heads of technology companies or companies with a passion for small business success. And were inviting media to cover that. So were having private roundtable discussions in places like New York City, San Francisco, and Boston, striking up really great conversations about how we can better serve the small business community. I would say what is shaking in my business is that my second book is coming out on April 16,  . Its ten episodes from my radio show. So Im very excited about that. And whats moving is that I am heading towards a membership site on my website that will be called the Small Business Reality Squad. So I will be offering the naked truth about what it takes to be successful in small business, for anyone who is brave enough to come along and listen. Im really excited to be launching my own mastermind program teaching people how to be their own boss, how to get free from a job. My book   just came out top of the year, second edition. So Im really excited. It has all the social media stuff in it. How to have a great Website, how to have a content strategy and how to become a social media ninja like me. As the end drew near to another great Infusionsoft small business conference, it was good to again take the pulse of the small business community and to think about what the future holds. Hopefully, it will be a future of more great progress and development as entrepreneurs build on strong foundations to create the companies of their dreams.","It used to be that businesses could plan for a one-device-per-user ratio in their networks. But that time is quickly passing us by. With the proliferation of mobile devices and the bring your own device to work trend (BYOD), todays employees may be using multiple devices. Companies themselves are now issuing multiple devices to employees. As a result, you may have an employee using a desktop computer and a laptop. Then he or she might use a tablet to take notes during a meeting. Oh, and during the day that same employee sitting in traffic may be using a smartphone with multiple apps. On top of that, you need to consider all of the other devices that are moving into the wireless access space, such as printers, scanners and even projectors. Finally, dont forget the increased reliance on cloud computing and the powerful cloud apps that devices connect to and use. As you can see, its a perfect storm brewing. That can put strain on traditional wireless and VPN/Point to Point network bandwidth infrastructures. In fact, some small and mid-size businesses may have hundreds of devices connecting to their local networks creating a throughput nightmare for IT management trying to rely on a traditional Wi-Fi network configuration. But what if you could increase bandwidth to your access points without any significant hassle? A few advances in technology, such as Managed Ethernet, can help reduce those infrastructure costs and offer scalability in a manner previously not possible. IT managers run into wireless network bandwidth performance problems in part because a typical Wi-Fi connection can really only support between 15, maybe as many as 25 devices. Each has a limitation based on its hardware  any more than that and the connection signal strength begins to deteriorate in a very noticeable manner. A typical tell-tale sign is when someone is attempting to watch streaming video, and the video stutters as video packets are lost due to network congestion. A router device is still a type of computer which requires processor and memory power to perform its functions. Among those functions is the division of bandwidth at the MAC layer in the 802.11 wireless networking standard, which divides available bandwidth 1/n (where n represents the number of nodes attached to the device). For instance, a single wireless access point, permitted 4MB of bandwidth with 20 devices attached simultaneously would have roughly 200k of bandwidth to use per device. Thats not sufficient for doing much more than basic Web surfing in todays high speed world. In a typical BYOD atmosphere, you have a ratio of 3:1 devices to users. Taking that into consideration, you can see that a different approach to configuring a network is crucial in order to make this work. suggests that by 2015, 80% of recently-installed corporate wireless networks will become obsolete because of poor infrastructure planning. When using their own devices, employees experience higher job satisfaction, increased mobility, and improvements in efficiency and productivity. In organizations that welcome employee-owned devices, IT teams can focus on more strategic initiatives, rather than spending the majority of their time dealing with help-desk tickets. Using their own devices cuts down learning curves, and support issues while allowing the employee to use tools that make them comfortable. A study by ZK Research suggests that BYOD will soon become the norm for IT. Further, the number of wireless devices will continue to explode as it reaches a 7:1 ratio by just 2016. Thats less than 3 years away! These numbers give you a taste of the amount of internet bandwidth you may need from your ISP and also the amount of bandwidth you will need on your corporate network to share resources, in the near future. In multi-site applications where the management of both internet traffic and business resources need to be shared from the main hub to satellite locations, consider strategies such as business Ethernet networks. With the ability to use your service provider to share all of your network resources and internet over existing infrastructure, you relieve your IT dept of considerable support burden. Just as importantly, you ease the burden of the financial and technical costs of doing business. Your Ethernet Service Provider will create the point-to-point shared connections over its network, creating a seamless multi-site LAN without all the additional internet connections and equipment typically needed to connect each site. Ethernet has come a long way in the past decade  under the work of the Metro Ethernet Forum, services have become standardized. Ethernet can offer increased wireless network bandwidth, better port speed, more access points and better available coverage. It offers scalability to accommodate your business growth  and the growth in devices. It is flexible and affordable, because you use what you need, without having to invest in a much larger than needed network today just to account for future growth. Best of all, it takes strain off the IT Department. Look for providers with a high-capacity backbone that can be scaled up easily, to meet your growing needs. By anticipating and addressing employees needs for multiple devices and more cloud access demand, you will position your companys IT infrastructure to embrace whatever the future brings. Youll keep productivity high, enable business continuity, reduce IT help desk tickets, and make things easier for all involved.",", the analytics and marketing suite specifically for Pinterest, has announced an interesting new service called Discover.

The new Asus Android tablet  theMemo Pad HD7  was announced at an event in Taiwan earlier this week. Probably the most attention-grabbing feature of the Memo Pad HD7 is its price tag. An 8GB model will be sold for $129. A 16GB version will sell for $149. In keeping with newer tablets, it will have two cameras. theMemo Pad HD7 will have a 5 megapixel rear camera in addition to a 1.2 megapixel front-facing lens to complement its 1280 x 800 screen. the 8GB model will likely only be available in emerging markets. But the more stocked model is still a bargain at its price.The Nexus 7 with 16GB sells for $50 higher than the expected price for the comparable-stocked Memo Pad HD7. The Memo Pad HD7 comes in four body colors: black, white, shocking pink, and lime green. Tablet makers have been focusing on camera technology and early reviews tend to agree that the 5 MP add-on from Asus is better than the camera situation of the Nexus 7, one the best Android tablet deals last year. In addition to the other products Asus expects to launch in July with theMemo Pad HD7, the company is likely pitching for a bigger share of the tablet and other device markets, and doing so by keeping its prices competitive. Asus made a big splash in the tablet market in 2012, and while it did not have the top-selling device like Google, its sales of these devices jumped more than 400 percent, according to . Asus was the fourth-leading seller of tablets in 2012. The 7-inch tablet size has proved popular for its obvious advantages. Its very mobile  light weight and small enough to slip into a coat pocket or ladies purse. The price is nice, too, with some available under $200. Yet, the screen is easier to read and use as a touchpad keyboard, than a typical 4-inch smartphone. Small tablets are not the best choices for doing heavy-duty work such as creating documents and manipulating spreadsheets. But they are handy devices if your tablet budget is low and you just need something to keep your business flowing (i.e., deal with email, messaging and use some apps) while out of the office for a few hours or even a couple of days on a short business trip. This video of the Memo HD7 shows how compact and portable it is:","There is a distinct difference between your brand and your branding.Your brand is you.

But have you ever thought of using LinkedIn for lead generation? We asked 13 members of theYoung Entrepreneur Council (YEC)to explain their best tips and tricks for taking full advantage of the career based site: Heres what YEC community members had to say: If you feel comfortable enough with the relationship to make a connection with someone on LinkedIn, feel free to go through his contacts. Copy and paste a short list of names youd like to be introduced to, and message him asking if he would be willing to make a quick introduction for you to each of them. Include a blurb the person can use to do so. Its a quick way to get warm intros.~ , There are targeted discussion groups on LinkedIn for almost every niche imaginable. These are typically full of people looking for support and answers. Give your expert knowledge freely, and start relationships in these groups  youll quickly become a go-to source and will generate new leads for your business. ~ , A Boolean search on Google is an amazing way to source leads based on keywords in LinkedIn. In the Google search bar, simply type in your string, which could be something like: site: www.linkedin.com AND (keyword 1 OR keyword 2) AND (Seattle OR Tacoma). Hit search, and all the people on LinkedIn that match those conditions will show up. ~ , Theres a very cool function within the group settings so that you can send free messages to any member of that group, regardless if youre connected with them. You can join up to 50 groups, so maximize that limit with groups of people or prospects you want to connect with. Make sure that you provide a mutual benefit for both parties when you message potential connections. ~ , One tactic I used a lot, especially when reaching out to other startups, was to compliment their business. I would say that I thought there were interesting ways for us to work together. It sounds stupidly simple, but its extremely effective. Ive closed hundreds of deals reaching out cold via LinkedIn with this technique or slight variations.~ , LinkedIn Ads actually has an optional feature called Lead Collection. This feature allows advertisers to collect leads directly through their LinkedIn ad campaigns. Members who click on your ad are taken to your landing page with a button to request you to contact them. Its incredibly easy for the user, and its easy for you to build up a nice lead gen list. ~ , LinkedIn has a feature that shows you people who visited your profile.

We talk about how important they are in influencing buying decisions, how SMBs need to respond to them, and how Google is starting to give more weight to reviews as social signals. But in doing that, we also create a lot of around the reviews that exist out there about our businesses. Theres the sense that a single bad review can kill your business. Or that a handful of unhappy customers can send new customers away and ruin your brand in the search engines. And while its important for a small business to build an online review strategy, its equally important to remember that were all human. A few bad reviews wont kill your business. In fact, those negative reviews may even help. Sound crazy? Below are five ways negative reviews can actually be good for business. What would you think when checking out a new business and saw nothing but glowing reviews and five stars? Youd think the reviews were fake. Or paid for. Or written by the business owners mother. We dont trust businesses that appear too good to be true because we know that were all human. We all make mistakes. And we all have bad days. If your online reviews are a true reflection of who you are, theyll account for some of those bad days. The simple fact is we trust a business more if there are at least some negative reviews because it helps us feel like were seeing both sides. We want to know the soup was cold or that the dress didnt fit. As a consumer, these reviews also help us feel more prepared. If we can see the problem points in the service or product, we can determine whether theyre deal breakers for us. If theyre not, we feel confident making the buying decision. As noted above, consumers look for negative reviews to identify weak points in your product or service. Maybe your dresses run small and they should order up. Or maybe your waitresses dont spend enough time tending your customers needs. Consumers value this information so they know what to expect. As a business owner, this is valuable information so you know what to . Negative reviews help your business to improve by showing you areas where you can do better. Instead of fearing these types of reviews, welcome them as an unfiltered look into your business. Once you know whats not working or areas where customers got tripped up, you can solve the problem and make the experience better for everyone. Instead of fearing these comments, thank the people who leave them. Yes, thats right. I just said you should your customers who take the time to let you know where you can do better. This is invaluable information. It also gives you a chance to show off your customer service skills and let onlookers see how much you value your customers. Consumers can tell a lot about a business by how they respond to criticism. If you handle the situation with grace, maturity and (when appropriate) humor, it tells them youre a business confident in what you offer and how you treat people in business. If you get defensive or argumentative, it tells consumers youre a business they may want to avoid. So respond wisely. If someone has left a negative review on your business that you feel is unfair or undeserved, show it to some of your biggest supporters and ask what they think. If they feel the review is warranted, theyll tell you and then you can fix it. But if they dont, theyre likely to go respond to that comment for you and help set the record straight. Theyll actually come to your defense and serve as an army of support for your brand. Consumers are passionate about the people and the places they do business with. If they see someone talking badly about their coffee shop, theyre going to hop into that conversation and fight for you. As much as we dont like to see negative comments left about our businesses, they do give you the chance to change the conversation and that persons experience. By responding maturely, validating the critique, and offering a promise to do better, you can significantly increase someones impression of your brand. And, really, if someone is unhappy with your service, dont you want the chance to make it right? Reviews are important and the more positive reviews you have, the more likely it is a new customer will feel comfortable taking a chance on your business. But negative reviews also have their place and can offer some benefits to any business. Speaking of reviews, the holidays are coming. Have you created your ? Get crackin!","I first heard of Shiva Ayyadurai while randomly scrolling through Facebook. A news article from Huffington Post appeared on my newsfeed, mentioning Shiva Ayyadurai as the inventor of email and honouring him for his achievements on the thirtieth anniversary of email. A quick google search produced another interesting piece, again from Huffington Post, which stated how two big American corporations-Raytheon and BBN- ran a sustained PR campaign to discredit and malign the brown teenager from Newark, New Jersey who was the true inventor of email. In postcolonial India where we are quick to claim and glorify the slightest recognition from the West, I was baffled at how I had not come across his name before; especially given the magnitude of this achievement. For Ayyadurai allegedly invented when he was only fourteen. The rest of his life is glittery with a vast array of entrepreneurial achievements (uncontested ones) from earning four degrees at MIT to founding Echo Mail, and many more. I saved both the articles to Pocket and forgot about them for a few days. When I tried to read them later, they werent to be found. An exhaustive search around the internet later I learnt that all the pieces hailing Ayyadurai as the inventor of email were taken down after a flurry of readers protested this to be categorically false. That honour instead went to American inventor Ray Tomlinson. Any search for Shiva Ayyadurai yielded three kinds of results:his , and and a fraud and Ayyadurais own slew of  . It was difficult to gauge the authenticity of his claims from either the trolls or his own websites. Confused, I reached out to him for an interview and he obliged. But a lengthy conversation later, my confusion has not abated much. Rather than endorsing or criticizing his claims (which this author anyway has no authority to do), this interview is an attempt at opening up legitimate avenues of conversation where we can discuss, critique and opine coherently and with dignity- something the American media has largely failed to do and our have not expressed much in either. He says, The main contention against me is that I am a self-promotional businessman. I am an internet entrepreneur. What does that have to do with the material facts of who invented email? We welcome your thoughts in the comments below. Please note that here we discuss only the contentious email issue. A more comprehensive conversation on his life, education and other achievements is forthcoming next week. Yes. I was fourteen years old at the time. In India I came from a family of farmers. My grandmother was a farmer. My mother, despite coming from an 'untouchable' lower caste family, worked impossibly hard to educate herself. My father grew up in the war and did not learn to read or write till he turned eleven. When we moved to the United States in 1970 at the age of seven I was keen to do well. Every time I went to India I realized how fortunate I was to have been given the opportunities I had, especially given where I came from. I knew I was not doing well for me but for so many who had sacrificed so I could be here. From then on I was motivated to change the world. Imagine the world in 1978. No PC's, no smartphones and no laptops. The ordinary person did not have access to the computer. Those who got to use it were highly technical people- system analysts, programmers, etc. and they too used it only for data processing. For me email was not a technical person sending another technical person a message. It was the entire system and it was designed for the ordinary end user. A doctor, a dentist or a secretary. So they would move from a typewriter to the computer terminal. That was what made email revolutionary. Before Steve Jobs created the computer, people had to build their own computers. They had to buy the parts separately and assemble it. That's what made the Mackintosh revolutionary. It was accessible to millions of people. Email made the computer accessible to millions of people and that's what I invented. The idea was to make communication accessible for the ordinary end user. It was not just making text messaging accessible. That's what they were doing. We had about a hundred different features. You see a secretary would not move to email unless it had all the features she was used to. She was used to seeing an inbox, outbox, address book and a trash folder. She was used to getting a return receipt. All these features needed to be interconnected. Email is a system of interconnected parts. It was like creating an engine. You have to understand the politics at work here. Over here is the military, the private industry and academia. What they were doing in the sixties and the seventies was trying to send a message from Point A to Point B for soldiers in the battle field. In 1978, at the age of fourteen, I had no access to that technology, did not use any of their parts. And this is what needs to be brought out. We didn't need any of their stuff to bring out the Email. We didn't even need the internet. The early email systems, from the one I built to all the way up to 1993 and you can read up on the facts yourself, did not use the internet. They were built around local area networks. In one office we literally ran ether net cords and set up our computers. We were not using their networks and protocols at all. They want the world to think that you need the military. That the military industrial complex creates great technologies. The reason there is so much anger and backlash is because we, as a public, have been taught to believe that our tax dollars fund the defence department. The defence department does research and once in a while we get GPS. We get Velcro. We get email. Its a way of justifying all this spending on the military. In 1978 I did not use even a single of their components. Philo Farnsworth, a fourteen year old boy from a small town in Idaho, invented the television. They attacked him just as viciously. We are changing the narrative here. What we are saying is that a small kid from India or Idaho could invent life changing things. We don't have to spend billions funding the military. The military industrial complex has convinced us that we should fund them because they are the big innovators. Only a white man could create something like that. A dark skinned kid in Newark, New Jersey-the thought of him creating the email is like an explosion to these people. That's why they have to pull down articles. You go my Wikipedia page and run through the list of previously published articles discussing my works and achievements. All the links have been destroyed. I have been a scientist and an inventor for forty years of my life. The idea is to not only destroy the accurate account of events but also to destroy me. The reason is not about me. It is about preserving that military industrial complex where we go kill people in the Middle East and bomb people and because of them great innovations come. It's not true. The email was invented through collaboration. But it was not of the military but through the collaboration of good teachers, my parents, Michaelson and the support of a small local environment. And that is revolutionary. If people know that the email and television were created by fourteen year old kids, then they realize they don't need to spend enormous sums backing the military. And that's what they are afraid of. The first myth was that the ARPANET created email. Absolutely false. What they did was electronic text messaging. The ARPANET was working on battlefield communications via telegraph. It was a very rudimentary system. David Crocker himself, in December 1977, wrote an article saying, ""No attempt is being made to emulate a full-scale, inter-organizational mail system. The second myth was that Ray Tomlinson invented email and that he sent the first email message. Ray Tomlinson did not write fifty thousand lines of code. He wrote may be fifteen twenty lines of code. He took an old program, manipulated it a little bit and he used the @ symbol to designate two computers. That's not email. That's not inbox outbox folders. But BBN and Raytheon launched a massive PR campaign to discredit my work. They wanted to build their brand. Being known as the inventors of email would give them tremendous advantage towards winning billions of dollars of security contract. The frankly racist articles put up at Gizmodo and Techdirt claim that RFCs were emails. RFC's are meeting notes. It meant Request for Comment. In those days you had a meeting, a bunch of guys were at the table and they would write out the meeting notes. They would send the meeting notes to everyone involved. RFCs are not a computer program. They are not any type of a specification for user interface. Its also claimed that the CTSS was email. CTSS was the system that was developed at MIT and it was essentially an early blog or wall post at best. They called it mail because in those days they would have a file and you could tack on another post to it. That's not email. Email by definition (I am the one who defined it, I am the one who came up with the word and I am the one who created it) is a system of interlocking parts- inbox, outbox, folders and all those things. Everyone attacks India to be the most corrupt country in the world. But it has nothing on American corruption. Here it is deep, entrenched and done in a very sophisticated manner. The article in Washington Post was written by a young black reporter. She started getting trolled within an hour of the piece being published. She called me up and said that my editor has thrown me under the bus and asked me to write a rebuttal against two people who were leading the backlash against me- one was a historian in the pocket of Raytheon. I chose to co-write my rebuttal with Noam Chomsky. When they finally ran the article, they only went with David Crocker. Even then, they didnt deny that I invented email. They said that electronic messaging existed before I came along. I am not saying I invented electronic messaging. Its existence goes back to the time of Morse code. But I did create email. Within seven days of the Washington Post article going live, they created an internet hall of fame and gave an award to Ray Tomlinson for creating the email. This is how the system works. Raytheons stock went up by $1 immediately after this announcement. There was a renewed flurry of hate campaigning against me. One blog said, This curry stained Indian should be beaten and hanged. If an Indian does great software coding, outsourcing or is the chairman of Microsoft, then thats cool. But an Indian cannot be an innovator. I am labelled a fraud. Wikipedia calls me a scoundrel, a conman and a liar. 1980 was when the copyright act was converted to support software rights. In 1981 I was sixteen and not aware of the complexities and politics at play. I couldnt afford a lawyer and so did all the paperwork on my own. It was only in the early 1990s that the Supreme Court began recognizing software patents. I couldnt file for my patent then because you cant patent something thats already been disclosed. Walter Issacsons new book Innovators, a book featuring solely white inventors, says that true innovation happens when the government, military and academia work together. Issacson says that the biggest motive for innovation is profit. The concept of money being the sole motive for innovation is bullshit. It is an idea promoted by those in power in order to manipulate humanity. Today my fight is no longer about who invented email. The facts are in black and white and your readers are free to make an informed choice. I am more concerned with who controls innovation and how is humanity going to move forward.   [This interview has been edited and condensed]","Social media feels good, but bringing money and new customers into your business feels even better. Thankfully, from the Facebook application Payvment can help small business owners to for a very profitable (and effective) solution. Though you may not be familiar with it (I wasnt), the Payvment app itself is not new.  Its been around since last year and allows users to build a retail store (or to connect an existing one) directly onto any Facebook page. Once you download and install the application, you can build a store directly onto your page to include all your products, photos, shipping information, categories, etc. [theres a how-to video for those who need .] Once you set up your online shop on Facebook, it will show up in a separate tab on your profile called Storefront where users can go to make purchases directly from your Facebook page. They can also leave the shopping cart open while they shop on other Facebook stores.  Its a new twist on that old, static shopping cart. Pretty cool, but that part isnt new. Whats new is the Facebook Fan Incentive feature from Payvment. If youre a SMB owner in social media, there are probably two things youve found to be true: Thats where the new feature comes in. The Facebook Fan Incentive feature allows business owners to offer special promotions to anyone who becomes a fan of (or now likes, thanks to ) their Facebook page through the storefront.  Businesses can set it up so theyre offering either a specific percentage off or another type of coupon. According to Payvment: Payvment is also adding the ability to let users leave comments and reviews about your products to encourage others on your page to make a purchase.   Page owners will have full control over the comments/reviews that appear and will have the ability to remove comments, if needed.  Though, Id be careful doing that.   Angry commenters may simply take their complaint somewhere else and add more fire to it now that theyve been silenced.  Use the same best practices when managing reviews. I think the new Payvment feature is worth SMB owners taking a look at. Its the first real attempt weve seen to bridge relationship building with commerce, and it does so in a way that I feel customers will find useful instead of invasive.   And because customers will be automatically prompted to become fans to receive the discount, its going to help SMB owners to naturally grow their networks and their reach to help better market to people.   Its similar to offering a discount to someone who signs up for an email newsletter, but youre targeting people on a much more personal platform. It will be interesting to see how users interact with the new feature and if theyll accept commerce on a personal social networking site, but Im inclined to think that they will.  Payvment combines brand awareness with brand loyalty and creates a real incentive for .  As a small business owner, this is one to watch and get in on. Its a hint at where social media could really be going in the future.","Are there really businesses you can startfor less than $100?

This is the second year he has done that. About 10,000 manufacturing employees will each get a payment of around $325. the amount is almost equal to a months pay for a typical city worker in China. Mr. Yang (pictured) wont go hungry, however. Last year he was paid $14.6 million. Hell have plenty of other non-bonus compensation. Yang appears to be bringing results for Lenovo. Lenovo has taken over the top PC manufacturer spot, with sales topping $34 billion. Hes also led the company to become a smartphone maker. Lenovo is also rumored to be considering a buyout of BlackBerry, which put itself up for sale last month. Some observers point out his motives are or the payment wouldnthave been announced so publicly. Still, the move isremarkable in an age when CEOs get multimillion dollar bonuses even when their companies post losses  or worse, as they are headed out the door after being fired. Perhaps Mr. Yangsimply knows a thing or two about employee motivation. The reality is, he stands to make a lot more later if employees feel a part of the companys success. Giving up his bonus today is a brilliant investment in the future  Lenovos, employees, and his own. It builds good will and a desire to do more among employees who see tangible rewards aligned with the companys successes. Its fairly common for small businesses to share profits  even though they do not have to. , small business owners implement profit sharing for a number of reasons: Running a successful business always rests on an interrelated web of benefits for all involved: the business itself, owners, and employees.  There has to be a benefit for every constituency. In other words, when you share profits, there are reasons it helps the business, reasons it helps the owners/shareholders, and reasons it helps employees. Does it helpYang and Lenovo? Of course it does. But dont overlook the benefits shared by all involved. Some entrepreneurs andsmall business owners understand this instinctively. To them, the Lenovos chiefs motives will seem perfectly aligned.","  After a bruising two-year battle, ride-hailing firm Uber is selling its China operations to bigger local rival Didi Chuxing in a deal that will give Uber a one-fifth stake in Didi. The merged entity is worth around $35 billion - combining Didi's most recent $28 billion valuation and Uber China's $7 billion worth - said a source familiar with the matter who did not want to be named before the deal was made public. Didi confirmed the agreement on its official microblog, but gave no valuation. In a posting on Uber's website, CEO Travis Kalanick said San Francisco-based Uber Technologies would have a one-fifth stake in Didi, making it the Chinese firm's biggest shareholder. Kalanick will join Didi's board, with Didi Chuxing chief Cheng Wei joining the Uber board. Uber will continue to operate independently, the Didi posting said. ""Cooperating with Uber will give the entire mobile travel industry a healthier order and a period of a higher level of development,"" it said. China has been a challenging market for Uber, which has spent billions of dollars in a price war with Didi. Both firms spent heavily to attract riders with discounts and both also raised billions in recent fundraisings. Uber is profitable in the United States, Canada and about 100 other cities. In an internal message to staff viewed by Reuters, Kalanick wrote: ""Sustainably serving China's cities, and the riders and drivers who live in them, is only possible with profitability. This merger paves the way for our team and Didi's to partner on an enormous mission, and it frees up substantial resources for bold initiatives focused on the future of cities - from self-driving technology to the future of food and logistics."" He said Uber was operating in more than 60 cities in China and ""doing more than 150 million trips a month."" Didi, however, claims 87 percent of the Chinese market for private vehicle ride-hailing. Richard Ji, Hong Kong-based co-founder of All-Stars Investment Ltd, which manages about $900 million and owns Didi stock, said the deal makes ""huge sense"".  ""Uber faces an uphill task in China especially since Didi is multiple times larger by transaction value and city coverage,"" he said. ""This will lead to favorable outcomes for both companies. The biggest benefit is cost savings, they no longer have to give out subsidies to drivers and passengers. It will give pricing power as the new entity will become the dominant player. That means profitability will come sooner than later."" Under the deal, Didi will also invest $1 billion in Uber, which operates globally outside China, the source said, adding to a series of deals and joint ventures Didi has struck in recent years.  INTERNATIONAL AMBITION Analysts said Didi's acquisition signals its readiness to step beyond its home market. ""This clearly shows Didi's global ambitions and its desire to work together with Uber to tap Chinese travelers, who are going out in big numbers. There's a possibility the two could work together in other markets,"" All-Stars Investment's Ji said. Didi said in its posting it will look to expand its international business and enter markets like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Japan, South Korea, Europe and Russia. Didi - itself created last year from a merger of two firms backed respectively by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group ( BABA.N ) and social network firm Tencent ( 0700.HK ) - has invested $100 million in Lyft, Uber's main rival in the United States.  It has also formed an alliance with Lyft, India's ride service Ola and Southeast Asia's ride-hailing startup Grab in an effort to compete with Uber's global dominance. The Didi deal is the latest sign that global Internet and technology companies are struggling to break into China's cut-throat market, where local entrepreneurs have built formidable businesses, partly helped by a supportive government. All of China's technology heavyweights will be stakeholders in Didi, as Uber shareholder Baidu ( BIDU.O ) will gain a stake. Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) recently made a rare $1 billion investment in Didi. China last week issued guidelines that establish a long-awaited framework for the booming ride-hailing industry and remove uncertainty for firms such as Didi and Uber. It was unclear whether the deal would need to be cleared by China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), the anti-trust regulator. ""Given Didi's reported high market share, any increment would attract MOFCOM's attention. But for the parties to seek pre-closing approval, each has to meet the minimum sales threshold. That's where it's unclear whether an anti-trust filing would be required,"" said Marc Waha, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright.

To be effective, your business needs a presence both offline and online. It needs to use print and digital marketing tools. It needs both advertising (paid) and publicity (free). Its the marketing mix that gets and keeps your company message out there in front of your target audience. Here are five marketing mix tips to seriously consider and implement: Print marketing items are not dead yet. Sometimes our technology doesnt work like it should, and having that business card and brochure as a backup could save your marketing opportunity. Besides, there are a lot of people who just need to have something in their hands in order to remember you, so give it to them. Have your calling card ready. Use this business social network as an extended business card. As people hear your name around the Web and at conferences, there is a good chance that they will check you out on LinkedIn (this has happened to me). So fill out that profile and link it back to your website. Your website is your digital home, so make it count. Let them know who you are, what you do, and how it could benefit them. And then solve a problem for free by answering a question that your target audience would care about. You could turn that answer into a little ebook or white paper for download, or make it a blog post. Just make sure its something that truly helps, because youre building a relationship, and fluff and foolishness is not good for business. Use press releases to let the local media know about your business and upcoming campaigns. Your company probably has some awesome events, but nobody cares if they dont have a chance to know about it. Its about the relationship, and email is one of the most enduring ways to build that relationship, so take the time to grow your list. For a beginner most of the initial work is in getting the code and placing it on your Web pages. But the email service that you use should have a guide or how to page showing you what to do. Once the code for your email subscription form is in place on your site, then you can begin to focus on what to send your subscribers each week or month. Remember, its that makes the difference. Just remember, its about consistency and the total marketing package. Its up to you to believe in your businessand to get the message out.","Youve had your Facebook page up and running for over a year, and still have almost no followers, likes, shares or any interest at all. What are you doing wrong? Surprisingly, many businesses overlook the social part of social media, creating a Facebook page that garners no enthusiasm. Heres why your Facebook page stinks and ways to make it sweet instead. Unfortunately, the goal is not simply set up a Facebook page. There actually has to be some thought and a clear goal behind it. What is the ultimate goal of the page? Do you want to find new customers? Build better relationships with your existing customer base? Inform people of exciting developments? State your goal clearly before attempting to design your Facebook page. If you cant tell what your goal is, dont bet on your visitors figuring it out either. If someone comes to your Facebook page and your last update was in May 2012, theres obviously no reason for them to stick around. After all, theyre there to engage with you and find out something new. Daily updates are a good idea, but at least shoot for one update per week. Let visitors know youre still out there somewhere. When you look at your page, what interests you? What would cause visitors to want to come by and stick around awhile? Give them information, offer them tips and do something to get them interested. People love to engage in polls, give their response to intriguing questions and learn behind the scenes insider info and generally get to know you socially  thats why its called social media. Boring your visitors is one of the 7 deadly sins of social media. You own Zoopapooha Corporation. But this isnt very informative for the casual visitor who knows absolutely nothing about your company or what you do. When someone comes to your Facebook page, give them immediate access to who you are, what youre about and why youre different from your competitors. Never assume a visitor knows anything about your company. Pictures, graphics, videos  all these things make the page more interesting and inviting. If you want to engage visitors, make it visually appealing so theyll stick around and give you a follow. Bland text doesnt really inspire much social media action. Are your updates and posts redundant? Youll need to create some fresh, new material to garner interest in your page. Post relevant news, new technologies or put a new spin on your ordinary business communications. Nothing says, We dont care about our customers, like unanswered Facebook comments. However negative or meaningless, take the time for a polite response and, when necessary, follow up with an email. Long posts look exhausting to online readers and most get skipped entirely. If youve got information to share, keep it brief and interesting. If its a complex subject requiring further explanation, include a link to your website where the whole story is available. This is why your Facebook page stinks. But at least you can fix it. Remember, it takes a long time to build a social media presence and most Facebook pages take a year or more to fully mature.","You need money to buy anything, but not necessarily everything. Again, if you think that only money can make you more money, that is not what I believe firmly. To me, and most of the startups as well, I think it is just the path you choose to make money that matters.

And youcan always take itone step furtherand learn theapproaches that may shape the . There is also a myth about increasing numbers of startups creating online stores almost every other day only to try out their luck. Many people think that it is only the money-minded people who adopt this new generation eCommerce technology to run a better businesses. However, this is not the fact. Any business whether online or offline needs a constant and serious effort from its owner. The only reason startups are using eCommerce as a software solution in leaps and bounds is that it makes their ground work easy and delivers them almost a ready-to-use selling system.Of course, there are a lot of handy options and multi-faceted features of an eCommerce platform that help store owners save on their infrastructure cost and work hours, but that does not essentially make them revenue automatically. eCommerce software acts as a tool with plenty of add-ons to get you going easily throughout the life of your store. The rest depends on your deliverables, customer engagement models, support system and other USPs that customers expect from an online merchant. Setting up a website is just the beginning for launching your business online. You cannot use it effectively until you have your own marketing strategies and chain of other associated activities underway. So clearly making quick money by setting up an online store is not what eCommerce software is meant for or even valued for. The tooling capability and the lower cost technology solution are what make eCommerce software a friend in need, a friend indeed for todays startups.

If 10,000 hours isnt an absolute rule that applies across fields, what does it really take to become world class in the world of work? Over the last year, Ive explored the personal history of many widely-admired business leaders like Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg in order to understand how they apply the principles of deliberate practice. What Ive done does not qualify as an academic study, but it does reveal a surprising pattern. Many of these leaders, despite being extremely busy, set aside at least an hour a day (or five hours a week) over their entire career for activities that could be classified as deliberate practice or learning. I call this phenomenon the 5-hour rule . For the leaders I tracked, the 5-hour rule often fell into three buckets: reading, reflection, and experimentation. According to an HBR article , Nike founder Phil Knight so reveres his library that in it you have to take off your shoes and bow. Oprah Winfrey credits books with much of her success: Books were my pass to personal freedom. She has shared her reading habit with the world via her book club. These two are not alone. Consider the extreme reading habits of other billionaire entrepreneurs: Want to read the most-recommended books by top leaders like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Elon Musk? Download the report I created that highlights the most-recommended books of 60 top Fortune 500 CEOs, entrepreneurs, and leaders. Other times, the 5-hour rule takes the form of reflection and thinking time. AOL CEO Tim Armstrong makes his senior team spend four hours per weekjust thinking. Jack Dorsey is a serial wanderer. LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner schedules two hours of thinking time per day. Brian Scudamore, the founder of the 250 million-dollar company, O2E Brands, spends 10 hours a week just thinking. When Reid Hoffman needs help thinking through an idea, he calls one of his pals: Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, or Elon Musk. When billionaire Ray Dalio makes a mistake, he logs it into a system that is public to all employees at his company. Then, he schedules time with his team to find the root cause. Billionaire entrepreneur Sara Blakely is a long-time journaler. In one interview, she shared that she has over 20 notebooks where she logged the terrible things that happened to her and the gifts that have unfolded as a result. Finally, the 5-hour rule takes the form of rapid experimentation. Throughout his life, Ben Franklin set aside time for experimentation, masterminding with like-minded individuals, and tracking his virtues. Google famously allowed employees to experiment with new projects with 20% of their work time. Facebook encourages experimentation through Hack-A-Months . The largest example of experimentation might be Thomas Edison. Even though he was a genius, Edison approached new inventions with humility. He would identify every possible solution and then systematically test each one of them. According to one of his biographers , Although he understood the theories of his day, he found them useless in solving unknown problems. He took the approach to such an extreme that his competitor, Nikola Tesla, had this to say about the trial-and-error approach: If [Edison] had a needle to find in a haystack, he would not stop to reason where it was most likely to be, he would proceed at once with the feverish diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search. People who apply the 5-hour rule in the world of work have an advantage. The idea of deliberate practice versus just working hard is often confused. Also, most professionals focus on productivity and efficiency, not improvement rate . As a result, just five hours of deliberate learning a week can set you apart. Billionaire entrepreneur Marc Andreessen poignantly talked about improvement rate in a recent interview . I think the archetype/myth of the 22-year-old founder has been blown completely out of proportion I think skill acquisition, literally the acquisition of skills and how to do things, is just dramatically underrated. People are overvaluing the value of just jumping into the deep-end of the pool, because like the reality is that people who jump into the deep end of the pool drown. Like, theres a reason why there are so many stories about Mark Zuckerberg. There arent that many Mark Zuckerbergs. Most of them are still floating face down in the pool. And so, for most of us, its a good idea to get skills. Later in the interview he adds, The really great CEOs, if you spend time with them, you would find this to be true of Mark [Zuckerberg] today or of any of the great CEOs of today or the past, they are really encyclopedic of their knowledge of how to run a company, and its very hard to just intuit all of that in your early 20s. The path that makes much more sense for most people is to spend 510 years getting skills. We need to move beyond the cliche, Life-long learning is good, and think more deeply about what the minimum amount of learning the average person should do per day in order to have a sustainable and successful career. Just as we have minimum recommended dosages of vitamins, steps per day, and aerobic exercise for leading a healthy life physically, we should be more rigorous about how we as an information society think about the minimum doses of deliberate learning for leading a healthy life economically. The long-term effects of NOT learning are just as insidious as the long-term effects of not having a healthy lifestyle. The CEO of AT&T makes this point loud and clear in an interview with the New York Times ; he says that those who dont spend at least 5 to 10 hours a week learning online will obsolete themselves with technology.

That was President Obamas first tweet, sent on May 18 of this year, from the new Obama Twitter account. Five hours after sending it, hed gotten more than amillion followers, breaking the record set by Avengers actor Robert Downey, Jr. when he joined Twitter in 2014. As of this writing, the President has 3.05 million followers. Thats not at the level of say, Taylor Swift, but theres something about Obamas Twitter presence thats both similar to and one a different level from the standard celebrity Tweet. As put it: There are few brands more powerful than that of the President of the United States, so its no surprise that President Obamas Twitter presence is receiving the kind of engagement every small business owner wishes for on social media. The President has used Twitter for everything from talking about his to weighing in on a New York Times food feature on putting (Obama is not in favor). And each of these tweets from theObama Twitter account gets a high level of engagement. More than 15,000 people re-tweeted the Presidents pea pronouncement. Another 430,000 people retweeted his message about the Supreme Courts marriage equality ruling last month. And countless people respond to each of Obamas tweets, often with crude, vulgar and sometimes threatening messages. The Presidents tweets are archived by the White House.The Secret Service reads these replies and has investigated the threatening ones. For most of us, the lesson here is that you should treat Twitter the way you would any interaction with the President: say the wrong thing, and you might find law enforcement at your door.

At launch, Minbox claims to be #freakingfast and up to twice as fast at file uploads as its competitor, Dropbox, and any other cloud service. With all due respect to sync services like Dropbox, the industry needs a lightweightalternative for direct transfer. Minbox gets it done at groundbreaking speeds, Minbox founder and CEO Alexander Mimran said last week. Minbox will import your Contacts lists stored on your Mac or Google account. When sending files, the built-in contact list saves time. Minbox offers unlimited file upload, i.e., there are no limits on the size of the file youre uploading to the cloud or the number of files. However, for some there is a drawback: files in the Minbox cloud are purged after 30 days. Minbox in the beginning is targeting professionals who work with images and videos such as photographers, videographers and designers  whoneed to send them to clients, co-workers and partners for review or one-time download. For them, speed is a real issue. The app allows users to leaf through the uploaded files that are presented in a gallery optimized for viewing on mobile devices (pictured above). Minbox says it is geared to a creative professional who sends large files on a daily basis. A Pro version of Minbox is expected to launch in the coming months. The Pro version will store files permanently. Until the Pro version is launched, Minbox will be of limited value if you need permanent storage. But creative professionals who need fast and unlimited file upload, and place files online only for a short time until they are picked up, will get value from the current version.

Halloween is just a couple weeks away and serves as the warning shot for the official holiday season.  Naturally, as savvy business owners, you want to make sure youre taking full advantage of the madness thats about to hit. And that means creating a holiday review strategy that will let you prime your reviews and testimonials for 2012. Things are about to get super busy, right? Why not put the increased traffic and eyeballs to good use and ramp up your customer reviews and testimonials for 2012? Here are a few suggestions to help you. If youre not already in the habit of providing incentives to customers who offer you site testimonials or reviews, start now.  No, you cant promise someone a discount if they leave you a positive review on Yelp, but you can throw a comment card in with their purchase and offer a discount or promotional item for filling it out and bringing it back completed. Or, if the incentive part makes you nervous, just add in a note saying youd appreciate it if they left their feedback for your business on whatever online review site youre trying to promote. Sure, theres the potential that theyll leave a negative review, but its more likely that they wont. And if they do, then you have an opportunity to fix it that you didnt have before. eMarketer recently performed by PayPal and Ipsos to see what percentage of people planned to use a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) to make a holiday purchase this year.   According to their results, 46 percent of users said they would. That represents a huge increase from the 2010 ForeSee survey which had that number at just 17 percent.  As a small business owner, this is something you must consider.  It means you want to make it as easy as possible for consumers to make a mobile commerce purchase, but it also means you want to be encouraging customers to leave FourSquare tips, to check in on their devices, to leave reviews on Yelp while theyre still in your store, etc.  Not only do you want to capture the people who are already making mobile purchases at your business, but you want to convert the ones still on the fence, as well. Its party season. Why not take advantage of that and hold an in-store get-together where you celebrate your success over the past year, while also providing customers a great opportunity to go public with their love of your company?  You can promote the event as a holiday thank-you to your loyal customers and let them know they may also be featured in promotional materials for your website. Once theyre there, ask for their feedback, take photos, get video interviews and ask for permission to use it on your website or in promotional materials.  Let them know youre only asking them because of how much you value them as customers.  You may be surprised how eager they are to support your brand. is a great way to build some brand buzz and fill the testimonial reservoir by creating an incentive for participation.  Again, you cant give customers free stuff in exchange for good reviews, but you can take advantage of the seasons playfulness by asking customers to participate in some kind of brand-related challenge.  Maybe its a video contest where you ask customers to explain what they love most about your brand or to submit the best photo of your product in use. Not only are you allowing people to share their love for your brand, but you also get some great content to put on your site and add to your testimonials. I know it sounds awful, but sometimes the best review strategy of all is simply finding new ways to make asking for a review part of your sales process. Take inventory of everything youre doing to solicit customer reviews and identify holes.  Some places you should be asking but maybe arent include: As business owners, were sometimes leery of asking customers to leave reviews because it feels like solicitation. We must remind ourselves that leaving reviews isnt yet a natural act for most people. And until it is, we need to remind people to do it. Above are just a few ways small business owners can ramp up their online review process during the holiday season. Will you make reviews a priority this year?","The use of laptops, smartphones, and tablets is on the rise, and airports are enticing tech-savvy travelers by offering wireless Internet access. The Department of Transportation reports that only 77 per cent of U.S. flights arrive on time. So luckily, because of free wireless at airports, you can go through your emails, latest news headlines or visit your Facebook page while in transit. Of the United States 30 busiest airports, a dozen offer free Internet. Twelveothers opt for a tiered plan, sometimes offering free access. McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas was one of the first big airports to offerfree WiFi. And the rest of U.S. airports are . WiFi is certainly not cheap and airports have an extensive area to cover, which makes it expensive. But customers want free WiFi and failure to offer uninterrupted wireless connection becomes a competitive disadvantage. Use of smartphones grew 50% in 2013 and global mobile devices stand at in 2013. The new generation of travelers always looks for consistent network coverage. Sohow doairports manage the expenses to deploy and maintain free WiFi? Ad supported WiFi has emerged. Several companies willing to run ads collaborate with the airport and the advertisers pay the WiFi bill. So, the airport allows those companies to run banner ads or any other types of advertisements over the airports free WiFi. Not only docustomers benefit from free WiFi at airports, retailers located within the premise can also take advantage. Almost all travelers carry smart devices and when they access the free wireless at airports, retailers can monitor their devices. It allows retailers to send a special offer to a customer whenever he or she passes certain shops. The tracking system logged into the WiFi network can identify the movement of passengers in real time. It cannot identify the exact location orthe shoppers themselves, but it fetches information relevant for the retailers. Some travelers fear the presence of an unseen tracker keeping an eye on their movement. However, data is collected to understand how people use restaurants and shops; the duration they spend inside a store; or the amount of time they wait fora coffee from Starbucks. The information gathered is then used to bring customers back to the stores. Monitoring smartphones and other WiFi enabled gadgets also helps airport authorities identify congested areas. It also displays the wait time for security checkpoints. If you connect to an unsecured connection in public, you may face various troubles. Hackers can collect information from your deviceeasily when you are using unencrypted free wireless at airports. Therefore, its not a safe place todisclose your credit card information, bank account information, or perform a transaction. There is also a chance of identity theft when you are using unencrypted free wireless at airports. So, checking your online profiles isrisky too. You have to be . If it is not urgent, its better to avoid financial transactions at airports."," When I entered the IIM Bangalore campus yesterday, right from the entry gates to the registration desk, at every point my mind asked a question where I was supposed to go, there was either a smiling IIM-B staff to escort or signboards to direct me.  I was aware that it is one of the biggest startup summit taking place in the country which is why my Editor flew me down to cover it, but having visited a few events in my journalistic career, I was still expecting arrangements here to be shoddy considering it was a student-led summit. Blame this cynicism for some of my past no-so-good experiences. Once down here, however, I was in for a pleasant surprise.  Walking down the lush green lanes at IIM to the Main Building where 'Eximius' was underway, I already knew I was going to not just just a big, but also a well-managed event. Often, when going for such summits, one sails through a comfortable experience but fails to acknowledge the efforts that go behind putting the event together. And so, I decided to uncover 'Behind the Scenes' to understand what must have gone behind putting together Eximius - an event that has 150 college partners, over 100 plus corporate partners, 6 stalwarts as keynote speakers (including former Finance Minister P Chidambaram , Rang De Basanti fame Kunal Kapoor, Actor-Singer-Theatre Director Mr Piyush Mishra among others).  It's no child's play really to host 37 events featuring 150 startups in a mix of sessions - mentorship, on-the-spot events like quiz and simulation games, workshops and B-plan contests where over a whopping Rs 1 crore is up for grabs! Moreover, some of these sessions have had several rounds before Eximius started, and will have several others after this summit ends. It means continued and doubled efforts for the Organizing Team comprising 33 members - all first and second year Post Graduate Program students. The show they put up is for everyone to see and relish, but the journey to this was a rather difficult one.  During my interaction with the organizers, I learnt that full-fledged work on planning the event began earlier this year, around the same time when several PGP students were underdoing rigorous internships. Kushal Singhal, the Sponsorship Head for Eximius, said, ""We were working for the event despite putting 16 hours each day into our internships. We would just go to our rooms to get some sleep.""  Nishank Bidamia, another core team member, said, ""Event planning starts 5-6 month in advance and the idea is to conceptualize the event well. We have to make sure the problems statements are conducive enough for participants, the kind of crowd that we get are good for sponsors and several other such things. At the same time, we didn't want to lose the entrepreneurship focus because our main intention all along was to keep Eximius more entrepreneurship-friendly this year.""  However, real introspection on how to conduct Eximius 2016 had begun last August itself, when the 8th edition took place.  Nishank explained how - ""Last year, the first thing we did after Eximius got over was to review the event. We started telling ourselves where we had gone wrong. On the basis of this, we decided to improve on our mistakes in the next edition. So, we first went about solving these problems before planning anything new.""  Once done, the team came up with some new sessions on social entrepreneurship, focusing on technology and digital marketing. Nishank took pride in adding that their hard work helped triple the prize money in competitions this year. No wonder, this team estimated the footfalls to be close to over 5,000 for just a two-day event.  The Organizing team roped in two big incubators- NSRCEL which has a long term association as it works as IIM-B's incubation cell, and Villgro which came onboard this year and claimed it was ready to provide incubation up to Rs 65 lakh if pitches by social entrepreneurs would compel them to.  ""There are opportunities of up to Rs 1 crore for people to grab in our event. Besides that we also have IBM and Kalaari Capital who will also be viewing entries. There again is a chance of getting VC funding here if startups impress them. We also started a monthly initiative called B-starters last year to promote entrepreneurship within the college. IvyCamp, a part of IvyVentures, was brought on-board so that people who want to be entrepreneurs in college and who aspire to be one in and around the college could get an opportunity to get access to mentors. We are carrying this association with them in Eximius where startups would get a chance to be mentored by the Ivy mentors,"" said Nishank.  The most startling fact is that they went contacting companies using social media. Kushal said, ""We contacted companies through Linkedin. The IIM tag and the success of the previous Eximius editions helped us a lot in getting companies to sponsor the event.""  Eximius has been growing by 15-20 per cent every year, and there was no reason for the organizing team who started looking for sponsorships in February this year, to believe that they would fail in their endeavour. But again, the journey was not a cakewalk and their sportsmanship reflects as they shared details with Business Insider.  Kaushal Kishore, the Secretary of ENI club at IIM Bangalore, said, ""For each sponsor we contacted, we had a list of at least 15-20 companies who rejected our proposal. Almost 35 companies rejected out proposal. Sponsorships side, we got rejections from on the event side as well. So, we must have contacted at least 100 or more personalities for speaker sessions. Some rejected the offer, some agreed but the time of the event did not suit them and so they turned the offer down, till ultimately when we zeroed in on the 10 eminent speakers that we have now.""  Even as it was a nerve-wracking moment for these students, the best part is they all laughed about it while narrating their experience. Just three days before the D-Day as I got chatting with them, they were excited and nervous both.  Kushal said - ""We attend classes till 6 pm, then assemble for the event work. We stay up till 6 am in the morning. Even if we there's time to sleep, we can't.""  But almost all of them pitched in to tell me what fun time they had attending classes, carrying out internships and doing submissions while working crazily for Eximius by staying up late, chatting and having meetings in the dead of the night alongside some music.  Kaushal said, ""A team of 33 have been handling this event and after passing out from college, we don't think we will ever get a chance in life when such a dedicated team would ever come together again to drive an event or a project.""  For someone who came here to cover the event, I see a larger thing that goes their credit - As innovative business models are being unearthed at the IIM-B campus throughout the day today, the team has been able to connect the student community and early-stage startups to the industry (mentors, investors and full-grown startups) inside their campus which can help ideas get transformed into empowered ventures. When we say India needs a startup ecosystem, this is what it means, except that it has to be done on a much larger scale, but with the same passion, dedication, willingness, commitment and goal.  .....At least we know, India is going into the right hands. Kudos, TEAM EXIMIUS!","Many people think of LinkedIn as just another social networking tool that lets them connect with people who share their career interests.

Matt Crowley, a corporate lawyer veteran with a Los Angeles practice that specializes in entrepreneurship, added to the start up universe with an excellent book, . The publisher sent a review copy, and I am pleased with how it untangles the complicated world of business finance. The book is similar to a recent VC book I reviewed, David Gladstones , but with a twist. Crowleys background, having served as a senior manager for a software development start up, provides legal perspective compared to the questions outlined in Gladstones book. A great mention towards the end of the book explains why venture capitalists do not sign NDAs: Crowley also offers solid advice on, well, seeking legal advice: I liked the comment on research that followed the aforementioned quote. And I liked his honest approach. Crowley mentions the word shark in , but the advice will not read like a shark teaching you how to be in shark-invested waters. Not every chapter is influenced by legal perspective, but just like the NDA example Crowley references his industry experience with aplomb. Chapter 2 notes about the value of budget. Chapter 7 notes when money should be raised and when it is too late. A few points outside of business structure will need refinement by your objectives.

Spending less can help us weather slowing cash flow; cutting expenses can help realize more profit. The following are my tips for saving money  I suggest sharing them with key members of your team. Its not just enough for the owner to be aware of spending; others on the team closer to day-to-day expenditures may also spot money-saving opportunities. If its been a while since you looked at how much youre spending on phone, utilities, Internet service, overnight delivery costs and similar expenses, it could be worth your while to look now. As technology brings new options to small businesses, such as VOIP, you can cut your costs by finding more affordable services. You may find cost savings if you reassess your small business insurance coverage. For example, is your coverage still right for your business needs, or could you reduce some of it to save money? By raising your deductible, you can lower the monthly premium. Just be sure you have enough cash in reserve to cover the higher deductible. If youre a member of a professional organization, like a Chamber of Commerce, you may be able to get lower rates through this channel. Schedule a meeting or call with an insurance agent to discuss options. A multi-line agent can help you sort through different carrier options. Ask about bundling, too sometimes you get a discount for purchasing multiple insurance coverages through the same carrier. Whether its trash bags or copier paper, buy in as large a quantity and as much in advance as you can  if it saves you money. Planning your office supplies by shopping ahead of time can help you take advantage of sales and warehouse shopping deals. For marketing collateral and signage for trade shows and events, finish them early to avoid rush printing and delivery charges. Real estate can be a sizable fixed cost. If you are strapped for cash, talk to your landlord about lowering rent, even temporarily, or moving to smaller space in the same building. Chances are, he cant afford to lose a tenant, and may be willing to negotiate. Depending on the structure of your company, you might not even need an officeespecially if yours is a startup and your staff can work anywhere. Remove the constricts of requiring your workers to physically be in your office, and youll save on rent, utilities, equipment  and your employees will save on gas for commuting. The bonus is that your . If you or employees need to get out of the house occasionally or working from a coffee shop just doesnt cut it, there are co-working spaces or virtual offices all over the country. They give you access to the Internet, copy machine, conference rooms and even receptionist services, all for a low rate. If you have in-house servers, you know they can be costly to maintain and update. Not to mention the fact that if you have a sudden surge in traffic or activity, it can be difficult to ramp up to accommodate the influx, short of buying more servers. Just like with freelancers, cloud servers and storage let you pay for what you need, and they allow you to ramp up or down as your business needs change. Cloud software eliminates the need to have staff update software, install patches and keep it operatingthis can reduce staff costs. You also can eliminate hefty up-front license fees, replacing them with lower monthly costs. Just be sure to tally up a years worth of monthly costs, to make sure you truly are saving money. A comparison of annual or multi-year costs, fully loaded with staff costs, lets you compare apples to apples. If your business is growing, but you dont feel certain enough to hire full time staff, consider a freelancer, contractor or third party agency. This way, you only pay for the work you need done, and you dont have the headache of benefits, raises and sick days. And if you need to ratchet costs down again, you can easily do that without the emotional trauma of laying off employees. Hiring freelancers works particularly well for professional roles: software developers, Web designers, copywriters, PR professionals, consultants, administrative professionals and the like. You will typically pay a higher hourly rate for a contractor versus an employee. But in exchange you may get a more experienced worker who accomplishes more in an hours time and needs less daily supervision. Remember, theres a cost for management and training time, too. Some business service providers offer a 10 percent or greater discount if you pay for six months or more in advance. And vendors for inventory and supplies may offer trade terms, where they allow you to pay early in exchange for a discount. If you are buying in large amounts, that trade discount for early payment effectively slashes your costs. Typically you get a discount of 1 percent or 2 percent for paying early, if offered. Or roll your own trade termsconsider paying via a charge card that gives you a discount or cash rebate for early payment. If you give your clients (or employees) gifts at Christmas or other holidays, take advantage of daily deals and coupons to save on flowers, wine and corporate gifts. If you have a credit or charge card that offers rewards, use the points. You still get the karma for being a gift giver, but your bank account wont take as big of a hit. Looking for business advice? Before you pay that consultant $200 an hour, look to local free resources for tips on saving money and more. Organizations like ASBDC centers, and offer free business counseling and mentoring and can help you with everything from creating a business plan to advertising in your community. Why pay for software if theres a perfectly good free or version available? , and are all examples of platforms that deliver free solutions (some offer paid versions for higher usage) for word processing, email marketing and project management. also has a plethora of free downloads in categories like security, development and networking, so check there first before forking over cash unnecessarily. Heres a final bonus tip: when cutting expenses, make sure you dont strangle growth. Cut where it wont affect your ability to make new sales or keep existing customers satisfied.","The long wait for implementation of 7th Pay Commission recommendation will soon come to an end.

You have to be, if you want to overcome the obstacles of running a business. Still, the economy has been pretty rough since 2008. Are there signs of improvement? If I had to sum it up based on two small business optimism surveys, Id say its status quo or perhaps cautious optimism. Per the latest NFIB Optimism Index, small signs of optimism have appeared. But they are hardly robust signals.According to the National Federation of Independent Businesss Chief Economist,William C. Dunkelberg, and analyst Holly Wade in ,Consumers are a bit more optimistic as are small business owners, but in the context of history, these measures are still weak. Small businesses are creating some jobs and hiring, and they are spending on capital for their businesses. In general the outlook for sales and business conditions was reported to be a bit better for the upcoming months: As you can see from the chart below, since 2008 optimism has been dismal, historically speaking. Theres been an upward trend, including that little uptick next to the red arrow, but its still not back to normal levels. The numbers reported in January are based on a December 2013 survey of 635 small businesses from among the NFIBs 350,000 members. The businesses surveyed are from various industries, with retail, construction and agriculture well represented. The majority have fewer than 20 employees. The Hiscox eDNA survey actually dropped in optimism from 2012 to 2013. However, the bright spot worldwide is the United States  comparatively speaking, at least. The Hiscox survey covers multiple countries where Hiscox does business. The United States reported the most optimism for the year ahead, in the most recent Hiscox survey. Fifty percent are optimistic (see green arrow in chart below): According to Hunter Hoffmann, head of U.S. Communications for Hiscox, Forty-eight percent of those in the U.S. reported increased revenue. Thats better than other countries we track, he told us in an interview recently. The average of all countries is a 37% increase. Hiscox has over 40,000 small business insurance policies in the United States. Hiscox from small businesses it insures. They fall into professional services industries, such asIT consultants, marketing firms, real estate professionals,personal trainers,health and beauty salon owners,life coaches andevent planners. Many of them are younger businesses owned by up-and-coming entrepreneurs. They tend to be optimistic and likely to implement innovations in their businesses leading to positive results, Hoffmann added. Hiscoxs small business portfolio consists ofsmall businesses with under $2 million in annual revenues (usually equating to fewer than 10 employees). About half are solo entrepreneurs. Hiscox also insures larger-sized small businesses through brokers. The survey covered 3,000 small businesses, with 500 from the United States. Business owners may be optimistic, but they are realistic, too. According to Hoffmann, they insure their businesses to make sure their hard work doesnt go away through no fault of their own or an accident. Hiscox has seen its insurance portfolio grow since 2010, when it brought its small business offerings to the U.S. market. The company offers three main types of insurance. Professional liability covers the business for liability when you give advice. General liability covers you or staff at a client location, or if the client is on your premises and gets injured. And a business owners policy includes professional liability coverage but also includes coverage for office space and damage to it. Whats your attitude toward your businesss outlook? Cautiously optimistic? Or status quo?","  MUMBAI Idea Cellular, India's third-largest telecom company, posted a 74 percent drop in its consolidated first-quarter net profit as a one-time finance cost for spectrum and lower voice revenues pushed its income down. The company posted a net profit of 2.2 billion rupees  ($32.92 million) in the three months to the end of June, missing a consensus forecast of 4.35 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data. In a statement issued on Monday, the company said one-off costs relating to the purchase of spectrum accounted for the drop in profit. The company, which has 176 million subscribers in India, said the mobile sector continued to grow in single digits unlike last year when the sector posted a double digit growth.  Idea, along with India's biggest telecom company Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone's India unit, have been investing heavily and slashing rates for their 3G and 4G services to retain customers as an impending launch of Reliance Industries telecom service launch expected to happen this year. Idea said almost 1.8 million customers are now on Idea's 4G network while Reliance has a subscriber base of 1.5 million, according to its latest annual report.

So he decided to build a product and business to meet that need. Anthony shares how he bootstrapped his vision and turned it into reality with over 400,000 users. He touches on the role the Google Apps Marketplace played in reaching the target audience, the collaboration tools used to get important customer feedback, and how his initial efforts on Google Apps Marketplace helped shape his efforts to engage other platforms and expand Insightlys small business reach. * * * * * I started Insightly just over two-and-a-half years ago. I found a need for a small business customer management solution that worked with and integrated with Google Apps. I couldnt find something in the marketplace that met that need, so I decided to do it myself. This appeared to be a great outlet for us to get visibility with small business customers and really show off the integration we had inside of Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs and Drive. Customers that were already Google Apps customers, if they had a need for a solution outside of the features set of Google Apps, could go to the Marketplace. Then with just a couple of clicks, could install one of those solutions  and try it out. We were fortunate to launch into the Google Apps Marketplace when there were only a few hundred apps. As we were built primarily on that platform, we managed to get some traction really quickly very early on. There was great feedback with the customers that used us and reached out with suggestions and features. That was certainly the case for us. Apart from the Google Apps Marketplace commenting and referral system, we used Google Consumer Surveys to reach out to our customers. We used Zendesk, an integrated support and ticketing platform for customer support requests/inquiries. We also used 99 Designs to design some of the pages and get some early prototypes up. In the early days, we did outsource some specific pieces of our code base; we used Odesk to do that. Using those specific tools and that approach, we had over 1,000 users within the first week. Then we grew to over 20,000 within the first three months. We stuck with the Google customer base and Google Apps Marketplace. Then once we had a fairly solid feature set that integrated with all the key Google services, we had a chat with Microsoft and asked how we could be part of the Outlook and Microsoft Office ecosystem. For the first year and a half, we were very much focused on the Web and having a compelling CRM (customer relationship management) experience. Then in 2013, we started to execute in earnest on mobile apps, IOS and Android. If I had to do that over again, I think I would have concentrated more on mobile a little bit earlier in the life of the company. That would certainly be one of the things; being able to pour a lot of resources into mobile. They can learn more on and sign up for a free account.

But new statistics released in October 2014 blew those figures out of the water. Some of these stats include: Pinterest has been reported to be an efficient marketing platform in many verticals: Pinterest is a quite unique platform too. For example, while Facebook is primarily aimed at connecting people to others they already know, Pinterest, on the other hand, is a purely visual platform that connects strangers to content. It is expected that this content will lead off the actual site, which accounts for how little time appears to be spent there. If you look at case studies of numerous Pinterest business accounts, you find the traffic referral rate is impressive in those who really push their campaigns on the site. Images have probably been the primary focus of your Pinterest strategy up until this point. But while it should make up a decent percentage of your campaign, there is so much more you can do. So before you start on that latest infographic, or open up Photoshop to enhance that stock image, it might be time to try another tactic. I am a self-confessed , it has to be said. Not only do I view a lot of slideshows there, but I post a number of them both professionally and personally. In my opinion, it is one of the most underrated social networks and content sharing services available today. If you dont have an account there, you should rush over at the end of this article and open one. Slideshare is pinnable in the same way a YouTube video is. If you pin directly from your slideshow page, it will create a still image of the title slide. Then users can view it there by pressing on the play button. Or they can just link back to the original, and view it there. This is a great way to promote your slideshows, because there arent that many currently on the site, at least not in the numbers that you see for videos. So yours will stand out, and with some good keyword inclusion in the description field, it should bring plenty of new eyes. : I am using to easily create awesome presentations (free). You have probably seen enough videos posted on Pinterest to know it is a viable option. But how do you optimize these yourself? First of all, you should only be sharing videos from YouTube or Vimeo. Those two formats are playable on the Pinterest site, so users can watch it right from the pin itself. That means they will always go to your pin to see it, and the videos goes right into their boards when they save them. Another plus is that you get to select your thumbnail image, to create customizable descriptions (complete with keywords), and to edit your link to go to either the YouTube video or your website, and it is traffic gold. I have seen people promoting the tip of just posting a link in a regular screen shot or customized title card image. But this is a soft option that doesnt seem to get nearly as many benefits. : I use to easily put videos together (Freemium). is another under-utilized content marketing tool and few people realize it can be part of your Pinterest strategy. Putting your podcast on Pinterest is a great way to get the word out about it. I would say this is the most creative and brilliant use of Pinterest integration yet. Keep in mind that Pinterest will automatically grab your podcast icon to put into your stream which means you should design your SoundCloud icon . Make sure the clip itself isnt that long. They arent going to stick around to listen to the whole thing in Pinterest, so you want to get them to go to your SoundCloud account for the real deal. : Here are a few audio editor .

With the July 31, 2013 launch of LinkedIn company page analytics, and new company page functionality launched in late 2012, you now have better tools. Below I give you a step-by-step guide to creating a LinkedIn company page that rocks  and drives sales. Before you consider adding a new company page, make sure that you can meet all of LinkedIns requirements: As recommended for your personal profile in  , make sure that you complete all areas in your LinkedIn company page. The more attention you pay to detail, the better and more powerful your company page will be. Start by filling out the company overview section. The information you need to fill in includes company language, name, type, size, website, industry, operating status, year founded and locations.When putting your description together, make sure you include appropriate keywords. Youll be able to describe products and services in detail in another section. The company description is critical. According to Lana Khavinson of LinkedIn, Google indexes company pages, which means your page becomes a tool for strengthening your companys rank in organic search results. The results will also display the first 156 characters of your company description, so be sure to lead with the most important information. After youve filled everything out, click publish. Your page will now be live. Next, youll want to include information on your Products page. These can be products or services you offer. This seems pretty daunting, which is why many people dont fill out this part. However, youd be missing out on incredible opportunities if you dont. So spend a few minutes and input the information. Dont forget to include keywords in the description, images and video if you have any. And remember: since many people dont bother to fill out this section, by being thorough you may gain an advantage over competitors. In addition to the title, you can include a summary description of your products and services.I also like to use this area to include a call to action. If someone is spending the time to review your products and services, you dont want him or her to leave without (hopefully) providing contact information. That way you will be able to continue to market to your prospect. In exchange for your prospects contact information, you should provide something in return  a free report, ebook, etc. There are several ways to include calls to action on your products page.One is to build a link into your product banner image, similar to the free demo offered by : , a full service digital marketing agency based in Newton, MA, gained a 200% traffic increase from LinkedIn to their website. How? Theyadded banners with a clickable Learn More and website URL to the top of their LinkedIn company pages: Another way is to include a call to action in the description section of the products page.On the overview page, you can also add a YouTube video and 3 banner images. After youve filled everything out, click publish and the page will go live on LinkedIn. Once youve added your products and services, you can get recommendations for them. Recommendations are very powerful sales tools. Youll just need to go to your product page and click on request recommendations.Youll get a pre-filled out request form that you can modify  or use as is.

One of the largest (and cheapest) messaging services in the world may be an option. One messaging app, posting names and phone numbers of 4.6 million users. But another, WhatsApp, claims to have reached a dizzying milestone: 400 million users a month. In a recent post on the official WhatsApp blog, co-founder and CEO Jan Koum what he believes is the reason for the apps success. Instead of allowing any kind of advertising, : Its actually free the first year and then $.99 every year after that. This still makes WhatsAppp more affordable than most other instant messaging services. The app is available for iPhone, Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry. Take a look at this report from CCTV America about the apps sweeping popularity. (And also take note of a reported $1 billion offer from Google to buy the service a few months ago. Its an offer WhatsApp apparently rejected.) The service could also be considered a form of social media, since users can share text messages, photos, video or audio with their entire list of contacts. (This is roughly similar to sharing content with followers or friends on Twitter or Facebook.) However, like SnapChat and other similar messaging apps, it is also much easier (in theory) to share messages only with individual or a select few contacts. WhatsApp is also among the messaging apps which some experts say may be siphoning off younger users from social sites like Facebook. In fact, about 78 percent of teenagers and young people now prefer messaging apps to social media when communicating with their friends, The Guardian . This may be an important trend if your company is targeting younger customers.","In February of 2011, a series of updates dubbed Panda. The Panda algorithm has demoted some of the spammy sites that had climbed search engine results. Unfortunately, these fly-by-night operations werent the only victims of Panda. It turns out that some small businesses have also been  . There have been this year in 2011. Discussion boards and blogs are littered with anguished entrepreneurs and business owners pointing out how their organic search traffic has dwindled due to their sites being dumped from top search results after Panda updates. While Google assures everyone that its efforts are for the greater good, some Webmasters contend Google doesnt realize how much it is hurting small businesses. Yes, larger sites have also been hit, but many of them have been able to put their Web teams and SEO teams to work to make changes. Small businesses, however, tend to have a harder time riding out the storm and recovering. Most small businesses dont have SEO staff internally. Their use of external SEO professionals is probably limited due to costs. Many business owners or key staff are do-it-yourselfers wearing multiple hats. They have tocannibalizetime from other businessurgenciesto understand and cope with algorithm changes. And fewer small businesses have the revenue streams that larger companies have, to fall back on until search traffic rebounds. Small business owners arent just sitting back and taking it. A site called aims to get Googles attention, or at the very least, everyone elses attention, on the matter. The founder of the site, who asks to be identified only as Max, created the site in response to Pandas first launch: is aimed, says Max, at bringing attention to the damaging effect of the Panda updates on small businesses: The site encourages other small business owners to tell their stories. Contributors to the site tell tales of losing their houses and laying off employees who were more like family. Max isnt alone in feeling frustrated. Chriss Bristow, owner of a site, and a retail website, is one such annoyed small business owner. His site is over 14 years old, and he insists he has only ever used white hat SEO techniques to drive traffic. When Bristow noticed his site had slipped down in ranking, he contacted Google to no reply. He tried to follow Googles suggested guidelines and resubmitted his site, but traffic continued to worsen. Bristow says: Bristow is saddened by the fact that his family owned business has had to lay off several employees, and he attributes it to Google Panda. Now, before you start boycotting Google (is that even possible?) its important to understand that Panda wasnt created to single out small businesses. But despite its intended solution to clean up the Web, some industry experts, like Aaron Wall of , contend it has had a disproportionate effect on small-business sites, : Why ecommerce sites? They tend to have a large number of product pages, many without inbound links to them. Such sites may be inadvertantly equated with spammy sites that also have a large number of pages but a low number of links to those pages. Small businesses may be suffering an unintended consequence of Googles effort to cleanse the Web, but there are things you can do to minimize the effect, according to Aaron Wall: And if you have a story of being Pandalized, share it on . Who knows? Maybe Google will be listening.","Sometimes all it takes is a single tweet or blog post to push a business to reach its goals. Thats what happened in the case of Gluten-Free Girl Flour Blends. The line of flour is the brainchild of Shauna Ahern, who has also been running the blog since 2005. Ahern and her husband started a to fund the flour lines launch. Heres the video outlining their campaign: Gluten-free flour certainly isnt the most exciting subject for a crowdfunding campaign. But Ahern was able to reach her $79,000 goal anyway. And it wasnt due to flashy ads or an incredibly revolutionary product. Actress and writer Lena Dunham tweeted about the campaign a couple of days before the goal was reached. Her tweet, which also included a link to the campaign, said: Dunhams 1.8 million followers likely played a part in the campaigns success. But the product has actually been in high demand for longer than the crowdfunding campaign has been in existence. Though Ahern shared the recipe for gluten-free flour on her blog, readers didnt much care for the idea of hunting down sorghum flour, millet flour, sweet rice flour and potato starch to make their own. So instead, they would ask Ahern if she would sell it. Finally, she decided to give it a try. So Aherns innovation, along with her dedicated following, worked in tandem to help her reach her goals. Dunhams tweet was one part of the puzzle. But that never would have happened had Ahern not worked so hard on building a blog following for so many years. Upon its completion, the campaign actually raised $92,612, which surpassed the original goal by more than $13,000. And Ahern isnt stopping with just flour. With some additional funding, she also plans to make a grain-free flour blend and other food products. She Businessweek:","From a small business perspective, the unveiled last week by President Barack Obama gets mixed reviews. Critics say the budget does not do enough to alleviate the tax burden on small businesses. The budget proposed by President Obama calls for the federal minimum wage to increase from $7.25 to $9 per hour. Following the release of the Obama budget proposal, Dan Danner, President of the , said the proposed hike is a major anti-jobs policy that will limit the volume of net new jobs at a time when the economically essential element of small business job creation is already struggling. Workers of all ages that are relatively unskilled are adversely impacted by this policy because they cant break into the job market, and small-business owners cant afford to create new positions for them, Danner said. The proposed $9 per hour minimum wage is lower than what some Democrats in Congress support, according to . The minimum wage issue often breaks down along industry lines. Hikes tend to be opposed by main-street small businesses in retail, restaurants, manufacturing and other industries highly dependent on manual or hourly labor. Often such industries have razor-slim profit margins to begin with. In some cases, they can ill afford expense increases lest they put the businesss survival at risk. On the other hand, small businesses with mostly knowledge workers or professionals may support the increase. Or they may take no position, because minimum wage does not directly impact their businesses. The President spoke about closing tax loopholes and raising taxes on people making more than $1 million. During his budget announcement in the White House Rose Garden, President Obama said his proposal also calls for investments in infrastructure creating new construction jobs  and for investments in manufacturing and hi-tech business hubs. The NFIB in its statement had this to say: The National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE), which says it represents 22 million self-employed and microbusinesses, . In a prepared statement NASE said: As Economics Professor Scott Shane has pointed out here before on Small Business Trends, there are . The budget President Obama proposes also calls for cuts in funding to certain entitlement programs. Some dont think there are enough cuts, and that . Others, like John Arensmeyer, the CEO at Small Business Majority, to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security should not be the way to reduce the deficit. Arensmeyer said, Cuts could undermine small business owners economic well-being and our burgeoning recovery, and should be left out of any final budget deal. The Presidents budget proposal also hits retirement plans. It adds a penalty for 401(k) plans holding more than $3 million. Brian Graff, CEO at The American Society of Pension Professionals & Actuaries, said this really isnt an example of closing a loophole and is not much benefit to small businesses but more of a hindrance. In a statement responding to the budget proposal and specifically a cap on retirement investment accounts, Graff said, If a small business owner has saved $3 million in his or her 401(k) account, they wont be allowed to save any more. Without any further incentive to keep the plan, many small business owners will now either shut down the plan or reduce contributions for workers. This means that small business employees will now lose out not only on the opportunity to save at work, but also on contributions the owner would have made on the employees behalf to pass nondiscrimination rules. Finally, keep in mind that there is no single small business position on any economic issue. Just like voters are never of one mind on all issues, nor are small business owners. Thats because small businesses vary widely in size, annual revenues, industries, goals and circumstances of the business owners. Although there tend to be common concerns to many, we never all think exactly alike all of the time.","In emerging marijuana businesses both the opportunities and the risks are, pardon the pun, high. The same could be said for the industrys startup potential. And even though traditional banks are not getting behind the industry just yet, there are investors in the marijuana industry. But even if you decide to take on a backer in your marijuana-related business, it doesnt diminish the myriad risks. The use of medical marijuana is hardly taboo these days. According to , 23 states and the District of Columbia allow doctors to recommend the use of medical marijuana, but it is illegal under federal law and therefore cannot be prescribed. Eleven states passed laws in just the last five years and more are currently considering similar measures. This rapid growth is giving credibility to the medical marijuana industry as a whole. And there ismore startup potential than ever in that industry. And now that use of medical marijuana is more widely legalized, the people behind these businesses neednt hide from the public or rent low-budget, non-descript conference rooms in the middle of nowhere. Theres actually an explosion of conferences for companies and entrepreneurs already working in legalized marijuana. And these are havens for entrepreneursconsideringentrance into the industry, too. If youre interested in learning more about the variety of marijuana business opportunities, check to see some listings of conferences in that niche. When you attend one of the conferences, its best not to go in green. Generally speaking, this is not the pop culture version of the marijuana industry. This is serious business. To that end, here are some industry-related business terms to give you an idea. A full glossary of marijuana business and industry terms is provided by the Marijuana Investor News. Some of those terms : The number of companies involved in marijuana, recreational and medicinal uses combined, is growing. And the industry itself is growing, too. There is more legal money involved in the marijuana business than ever before in the U.S. ArcView Group is an but it also helps growth within the marijuana startup scene. According to Troy Dayton, ArcViews CEO, the total legal cannabis market in 2014 grew to $2.7 billion, a 74percentincrease overthe previous year. And its likely these numbers will increase this year. Simply put, there are more people at liberty to contribute to the medical marijuana economy.Michael Zaytsev, co-founder of the High NY Meetup.com group is focused on empowering cannabis leaders through networking and knowledge. He says: In its Cannabis Industry Report, Viridian Capital Research found: Puns and joking aside, the marijuana industry is legitimizing itself. And with that growth also comes a time of maturity. Even if banks are refusing to back the industry  mainly because in the eyes of the federal government its considered illegal  private and public investors arent exactly shying away at the opportunity.There are even hands off investment opportunities where the actual marijuana plant is never handled, such as the MassRoots iPhone app, the information-sharing community that trades publicly on the OTCQB, an over-the-county securities market, under the symbol MSRT. Here are some recent examples highlighting the growth and acceptance of the marijuana industry: That type of investor is not looking for some garage grow room operation. Theyre expecting a professionally-run and well-managed business as the recipients of their investment money. And in the face of this rapid growth, Viridians report warns that this year will see many more marijuana-related businesses fail because of this. Researchers said: Of course, the one big risk involved with any business in the marijuana industry is the fact that marijuana is still illegal in the eyes of the federal government. State laws and business licenses aside, marijuana is considered a Schedule 1 narcotic per the federal Controlled Substances Act. And there is no federal agency that will back its use for any medicinal purposes. And as with any illegal industry, the legal landscape is fogged. It stands to reason that this area will remain a hot topic for the near future. Remember, use of marijuana for any purpose is still illegal in more than half of the U.S. So there are interstate commerce laws to consider on top of the federal. Within the canna-business community, the risks involved are considered essential knowledge and emphasized because of the domino effects they can create. For example, traditional financing and even normal banking can get complicated because federal regulations preclude transactions involving drug money. Proceed with caution and preferably with strong local and online communities to guide you.","A Pittsburgh eatery has done away with one of the most common practices in the restaurant industry. Bar Marco announced last week that it will eliminate tipping and instead pay its full-time employees a living wage. Full-time servers at Bar Marco currently make $5 per hour in addition to tips, which is above the state-required minimum wage for servers. But starting in April, the restaurant will instead pay full-time employees an annual salary of $35,000 with health care and company shares. The idea for this change came to Bar Marco owners about a year ago, when they were looking for a way to offer health care coverage to employees. Co-owner Bobby Fry the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review: In addition to no more tipping and creating a more regular pay schedule, the restaurant also hopes that the change will help create a more positive work environment for employees. While tipping has been an accepted practice in the restaurant industry for years, having the guarantee of a regular paycheck could encourage employees to stick around longer. And since employee turnover is usually a big part of the food service business, the new format could make a big difference. Both owners and employees seem confident that the change will work for this particular business. In fact, Bar Marco doesnt even plan to raise menu prices to cover the change. Instead, it plans to change the reservation system for its Wine Room so it will be able to accommodate more customers. Bar Marco isnt the first restaurant to decide there will be no more tipping. In fact, several restaurants have made headlines in recent months for doing the same. However, each one has chosen its own model for doing so. And just because a tip-free system might work for some, doesnt mean it will for every restaurant out there. In some settings, customers might not mind slightly higher prices instead of paying a gratuity. But in others, customers might be more likely to go for lower prices and using tips as an incentive for great service. Bar Marcos management has come up with a system it thinks will work for its customers. What do you think about no more tipping at restaurants?","Stitch Labs recently announced the integration of its inventory management software with Xero, a cloud accounting application. The Stitch  Xero integration means that after a one-time setup, information and transactions can sync up between the two applications without needing to update the two accounts separately or re-key information manually.

For business systems, integration of one vendors product with anothers can make it easier, cheaper and better for the end customer  i.e., for you. This is one of several reasons the cloud is so valuable today. Cloud apps (a highfalutinterm for a software application you get access to over the Internet) can make integrations easier to accomplish. Product vendors have two choices when it comes to product strategy. One choice is to offer an . In other words, vendors build features into their products to serve the customers entire process, end to end. However, it can take years to build all those features. In some cases, it can make the product more expensive for the customer. The other choice is to partner with other vendors already serving a function or slice of a process. This way, customers already comfortable with using another product for a particular function dont have to switch. They continue using the product their staff is trained to use. Stitch Labs has chosen the latter strategy. Its integration with Xero is not its first.  In 2012, Stitch added integration with including Shopify, ShipStation, PayPal, Big Commerce, Amazon, Google Drive, SAIL, and Storenvy. The company says the partnerships are part of a customer philosophy to build a set of services automating some of your most tedious operational activities. No matter which strategy is chosen, the end goal is the same: make it better for the customer. A well-executed strategy that focuses avoids errors and delay that result from gaps in the workflow.Instead of requiring manual action, data can be passed along electronically from one step in the process to the next. Stitch Labss strategy of partnerships provides a good lesson for small businesses  in two ways. Ryan Lawler of TechCrunch observes that is aimed atsolving the typical kind of problem faced by small businesses. They have important and complex workflow issues necessary to run their businesses. Tech integration can make it easier for them. Look at how you can make things easier for customer by integrating your product with other products that your customers use. By the way, you dont need to have a product to integrate with another provider. Even if you offer a service, there may be a way to integrate a vendors product into what you do. You just need to think about how to make it easier on the end customer you serve. Let me give you an example, using accountants, a quintessential service provider. These days many accountants interact with information from clients electronically, by working directly in the clients accounting system or capturing data directly from it. Clients dont have to download spreadsheets or email information back and forth. Instead, the accountant logs in to the clients accounting system, balances the books, and performs other activities. In a way, the accountant has integrated its service with a product the client uses. Its valuable for the client, because you dont cause them unnecessary manual work. Youve made the clients operations more efficient. Think about that model and how your business could offer similar benefits to your end customers. When you are in a position to shop for technology to run your own business, look for applications that integrate with systems you already use and dont plan to stop using. That should be near the top of your shopping checklist. You dont want to have to manually enter information from one system into another. Not do you want to jump through hoops such as downloading and then uploading spreadsheets. Doing so just institutionalizes inefficiencies in your operations. If your business is like my small business, you dont have people or time to spare. An hour saved here, two hours saved there, week after week, can really add up to higher profits.","If you prefer Windows mobile devices for your business, you know the choices out there are limited.After all, smartphone and tablet makers must pay a license fee every time they install Windows on one of their devices. By contrast, Googles popular Android operating system is free. So theres often little incentive to make a Windows device when Android is clearly the cheaper option. But all of that may be changing soon. Heres why. Earlier this year, reports emerged suggesting to add Windows Phone as a second option on its flagship HTC One.Reduced or free licensing may have been part of that discussion too. But now the software giant may be considering free licensing of Windows Phone and Windows RT (a tablet operating system) for all mobile device developers, The Verge. The company hopes the new option of free operating systems will convince other mobile technology developers to use them in more devices. But thats not the only reason Microsoft may be considering this change in its longtime policy. earlier this year may also be a factor in the companys decision to offer free licenses for Windows Phone and Windows RT to other mobile device builders. Why? Well, Nokia is currently the largest maker of Windows Phone devices and the only other maker of Windows tablets other than Microsoft. So with the acquisition of Nokia, Microsoft loses its largest source of revenue from that licensing anyway, The Verge reports. The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission recently approved the $7.2 billion deal which is now waiting on a decision by EU regulators. The Microsoft will need to look for other sources to make up the lost revenue including apps and services. But the cutting of licensing fees should definitely lead to the building of more mobile devices using Windows operating systems.","The iPhone has exceeded sales expectations this quarter. The iPad, not so much.If youre in the market for a tablet for business there are many other options to consider these days and some a bit easier on the budget. Apple shipped 31 million iPhones for the second quarter, . Thats less than the 37.4 million the company says it shipped in the first quarter of 2013 but more than the 26 million it shipped last year around this time. Sales of the companys iPad tablet, by contrast, seem to definitely be slipping. This past quarter, Apple reported shipping just 14.6 million of the devices, a steep decline compared to the 17 million iPads shipped by the end of the second quarter in 2012. One possibility is that sales are tapering off as customers wait for the next generation of iPads expected in September. If so, Apple could see an even bigger drop in sales next quarter, . Of course, another possible explanation is that the iPad is simply facing competition from more affordable tablets, . In fact, one industry analyst, Glen Yeung of Citi Research, projects iPad sales will remain below the industry average. And though iPhone sales still look strong, there are signs here too that competitors are making inroads. The Samsungs smartphone revenue eclipsed earnings from the iPhone for the first time this quarter. The Korean company made $5.2 billion in second quarter earnings off devices like the Galaxy S2 while Apple made just $4.6 billion in smartphone sales.","Streamlining processes is important for business efficiency. However, many times people find that their attempts to do so still require a little bit of this here and a little bit of that there and so on. Wouldnt if be nice to have workflow efficiency instead of work segment time suck? Thats what Lawton Ursrey  Product Marketing Manager of Sage One and Founder of Indie Peace feels. Tune in as he discusses this concept and his solution with Brent Leary. * * * * * SageOne is a SaaS application. The gist of it is you have a lot of small businesses that need time tracking. They need project management, task tracking and they need to manage expenses  pretty much the usual suspects. They are using a widget or app here and a desktop application there. Many times their mix of solutions were disconnected. So we went out into the field and the problem we found instantly was that a lot of the business owners consider what they have set up to be workflow.But it ends up really being work segments. These work segments are the result of disconnected applications. They require the Entrepreneur to pick up their slack by being the human transport for communication and information sharing with each other. We want to eliminate the repetitive redundant administrative tasks holding the entrepreneur captive. This is at the heart of Sage One. The result is more time to focus on growing their business instead of the boring administrative work. Were focused on helping the entrepreneur reclaim his/her business day. We really believe that your projects are connected to your tasks. Your team has the assigned task, they are able to track their time associated with that task, that should all flow straight into an invoice, and we believe you should minimize the amount of time and the clicks along the pathway from landing the job to getting paid for the job. Thats pretty much the gist of what SageOne does. Connecting the disconnected to help the Entrepreneur reclaim the business day. There are a lot of similarities in working with Sage, on SageOne.com. It really helped me analyze my processes internally at Indie. I have the same problem, but the issue for a lot of business owners is that there isnt a real solution thats truly connecting all of the essential business pieces together. For instance, our invoicing process within Indie is terrible. It needs more automation. Indie Peace is an organic clothing line. We are exclusively USA grown and USA made. Right now, we sell all online at IndiePeace.com. Everything we make uses water based prints, low impact dye, and organic cotton. One. Lawton Ursrey. Yes, we are approaching our fourth year now. We shipped to Nordstrom the first year out of the basement. Now I have rented out an extra roomat my home. Its challenging, but I wouldnt trade any of it. Its fun being an entrepreneur. Immensely. I only have one approach now. The entrepreneurial one. At this point, I cannot think any other way. Being an entrepreneur changed me forever. It also gives me a sense of certainty with my decisions. It helps to mitigate risk with many decisions as Im pulling from my experience in literally playing every role at my company. My confidence has really improved because of it, which is good when working in a large corporation or small business. The entrepreneurial experience is my education, foundation, and the source of my certainty. Sometimes its not about what youve read in books. It keeps me focused on the biggest issue that we found- when we studied the work day of many entrepreneurswork segments, not workflow. Making sure that related things flow into the next process. Work segment being, youve got a project management application online. You set that up within some solution and then youre managing personal tasks for yourself, business tasks, and then you are working with another group on a task management application. Then you have two apps at that point. This is where the problem starts if the solutions are not syncing to share information and files. The accounting also has to be done. Now were going from project management task management to accounting. Three separate solutions for related things. Most of the time the solutions were not communicating. All businesses we met with had the same challenge. They were the traffic cop; sending and receiving information and files, and keeping it all organized the best they can. Keeping their team in the loop was also a huge challenge. The business was scattered across various solutions and the entrepreneur was losing a lot of time in the business day. Then you move onward. You have the task taken care of. But you need to track your time. This will eventually flow into an invoice so the business owner and their collaborators are tracking their time. More often than now the tracked time did not flow directly into an invoice. There was a lot of redundancy. When collaborators were added to the disconnected mix, it really amplified things. The quickest way we had seen, with business owners right now, is they are creating the invoice. They create their invoice sequence, attach it to an email, and a lot of times they just track it in their calendar. Then if they hadnt been paid they just resent it. But when they resend it, they are opening the invoice back up. Updating the number sequence to identify it as the second invoice. Save it down to their invoice folder, which a particular customer is associated with. Write an email to the customer, attach the new invoice, then cross their fingers for payment. That is not a primitive process. However, we think this can be improved. Speed is part of it, but thats not everything. Its about taking action only when you need to and making the action you take rapid. In Sage One if youre not paid, Sage One notifies you via email and a notification pops up in the dashboard. You click it and you hit resend. Done. Whats the real issue? A lot of times its the ends of work segments not being connected. The business owner really needs awareness to resend the invoice without having to look for it and they dont need to continuously monitor these things. This ultimately drills down to one thing  the entrepreneur is spending more time on administrative stuff. Its getting worse and worse. What happens when you connect these essential functions together? That is what SageOne is really about. .","Outright is a simple, online bookkeeping service. Key in on the term simple. Ive never seen an easier financial tool for a business owner. Thats not me gushing over this product, but stating the obvious. If you have a bookkeeper now, this tool lets you see daily progress instead of waiting for that in-person meeting at the end of every month or quarter. Let me jump to the first page screenshot after you sign up. It doesnt get any more clear and concise. You know exactly where to start  either money coming in, or going out: This short description from their home page sums up their focus and mission: The main benefit of Outright is that it asks you to keep track only of the income and expenses; it does the rest. Of course, lots of programs do that, but Outright has only those items asking for your attention in its streamlined dashboard. If youre busy, and I know you are, then seeing only two choices on the screen (above) makes it a breeze to navigate and take care of an item. There are only four tabs: Income, Expenses, Taxes, and Reports. I can quickly wrap my head around that and feel less intimidated than I do with other financial software packages. I like that it integrates with a few other useful services, such as, Freshbooks for your invoices, Shoeboxed for your receipts, and oDesk for income payments. Id love to see eLance and Guru added to the mix as I use those two more than oDesk. They also mention that they are building an import tool to bring in credit card statements, but that it is still in test mode. On the Tax tab, Outright estimates how much tax I owe this quarter and even has a Pay button at the bottom. My immediate reaction is, wow, I can pay my quarterly taxes from here. What it does is enter that transaction into your Outright register as an expense. Useful and logical, but it left me a bit disappointed. They should probably have some sort of explanation pop up or beside that feature. When you hover over the blue circle with the i, you get a breakdown of income, expense, and profit for that specific income item. Nice shortcut instead of having to wait for it in a report later. If you are constantly scrambling to get your taxes done each quarter and at the end of the year, then Outright might be the simplified bookkeeping solution you need. If you find that you get overloaded looking at the dashboards of more robust, comprehensive financial software packages, then Outright might ease your headaches. According to the companys FAQ, Outright is designed specifically for sole proprietors and single-member LLCs  t That rules out partnerships or large companies, which need a more robust solution anyway. Theres no reason why a small microbusiness with a few employees couldnt use it for the basics, but without a payroll feature youre limited in managing your company books. Payroll is on the future feature list, though. But if youre a sole proprietor, or a new entrepreneur, or you run a small home-based business, Outright is a great place to start keeping your books.

I recently wrote about as a way to reduce overall company health care costs. However, the costs that come with it are often a barrier for organizations  especially for smaller businesses. According to the 2013 Aflac WorkForces Report, only 7 percent of businesses with 3-49 employees have a wellness program.Even so, the survey showed that 61 percent of companies strongly or somewhat agree that wellness programs can directly impact corporate profitability. So how can small businesses make the case for themselves that these programs are worth implementing? Its all about ROI (return on investment). A by Health Affairs found that medical costs fall by about $3.27 for every dollar spent on wellness programs and that absenteeism costs fall by about $2.73 for every dollar spent. Another by Harvard Business Review of several wellness programs shows a clear impact. In the Harvard study, one company saw a return of $2.71 on every dollar spent on wellness programs, and cumulative savings of $250 million on health care costs in a decade. Another reported an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years, with a savings calculated of $1.5 million, along with workers compensation insurance premiums having declined by 50 percent. Measuring the return on investment from small business wellness programs is a challenge. In fact, the Aflac study showed that only three out of 10 companies (32 percent) have managed to do so. Each small business is different. Im not going to pretend to know the nuances of your specific business and how a wellness program could deliver ROI for your particular situation. However, weve identified a few measurements that can help companies determine program successes that may provide valuable perspectives. Employees enrolled in small business wellness programs are more likely to be knowledgeable about benefits options and health care. They are also more likely to be engaged in their benefits programs and choices. Surveying benefits knowledge, understanding and overall engagement can show a direct link to a companys investment in benefits packages and efforts to market those benefits options. The Aflac study identified that employees who are enrolled in worksite wellness programs are more satisfied with their jobs and benefits packages, and also express more confidence in their employers. These measures can have a critical impact on a companys bottom line. Whether by measuring employee tenure and retention, or employee referrals, understanding worker satisfaction and morale can help show the enduring value of a companys wellness initiatives. The Aflac study reveals employees that participate in small business wellness programs are more than 10 percent more likely to say they are healthy because they exercise and eat right (41 percent compared to 30 percent). Likewise, financial security is critical to overall workforce health. The Aflac study found only 16 percent of employees say they are extremely or very prepared to pay for out-of-pocket expenses associated with serious illness or injury. Tracking overall employee health and wellness is essential to understanding a programs success. Measuring a decline in sick days or unexpected leave will help to gain a good measure of physical, emotional and financial health.","Theres a wonderful new book out called by Dan Ariely that points out many interesting findings from behavioral economics that help to explain why people behave the way that they do. The book offers a lot of useful insights for anyone who runs their own business. Here are three things that the book explains, and the implications of that point for entrepreneurs. Ariely points out that people who have something consider it to be much more valuable than people who dont have it. This point explains why its so hard to get a business buyer to offer you a price for your company that you think reflects its worth and why it is difficult to get an investor to value your business at what you think it is worth. Ariely explains that we have an irrational desire to keep our options open, which hinders our performance. This point explains why companies that fail to focus often do worse than those that focus on one product or market. Ariely points out that we believe that things that cost more are of greater quality than things that cost less. This point explains how entrepreneurs can use pricing strategy to make money from the irrationality in human behavior.

The Republican nominee for President says what makes him optimistic about the country is the entrepreneurial spirit he sees as he campaigns across America: Romney believes that President Obamas policies have created a hostile environment that made things harder for small business owners. Chief among Romneys targets, the stimulus package: The Presidential challenger also took aim at Obamacare, which he says: He vows to repeal whatever parts of the legislation that the Supreme Court upholds. Additionally, Romney has blasted government regulation and the growing intrusion of federal regulators during Mr. Obamas first term. For his part, President Obama has been touting his successes, including the impact that SBA lending has had on small business owners . Further, he has pushed Congressional leaders to approve legislation granting a 10 percent income tax credit to firms that create new jobs or that increase wages in 2012. The President also wants to extend a 2010 measure that enables firms to deduct the full value of investments made through 2012. Mr. Obama believes his plan to help business owners is superior to help small companies create jobs. Meanwhile, the credit market remains tight for entrepreneurs in search of capital. The latest Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index, a monthly an analysis of 1,000 loan applications, found that loan approvals by big banks dropped from 10.6% in April to 10.2% in May 2012, but was up slightly from the 9.8% approval rate one year ago. Additionally, small bank lending fell from 45.9% in April 2012 to 45.5% in May 2012, a figure that is still a half percentage point higher than the 45.0% reported in May 2011. The May 2012 loan approval rate of credit unions increased to 57.6%, up 0.2% from April 2012 and up more than six percentage points higher than in May 2011. Alternate lenders also upped their lending to 63.2%, as a tight market for traditional funding is forcing small businesses to look for options such as factoring and merchant cash advance. This is the third month in a row that big bank lending to small businesses dropped. Small banks decreased their lending approvals for a second straight month, as well. Combined with another poor jobs report, continued jitters in Europe and uncertainty on Wall Street, the economy looks like it is slowing. Look for both Mitt Romney and President Obama to debate where the country is economically from now until Election Day. lending for small businesses, which create the lions share of new jobs, has stalled.","And all of these people have brought something diverse to the table at TaxiForSure. So for all of the people who work at TaxiForSure, apart from the work that they do, there is much more that they can take away from the company, says Raghunandan G, co-founder, TaxiForSure (TFS) about the team.

But how different will the eCommerce experience be this year compared to previous years, and are small businesses ready for it? Brennan Loh, head of business development for Shopify, helps us understand the impact mobile and social is having on eCommerce from a small business perspective, and how focusing on customer engagement over individual transactions is the key to long-term success. * * * * * I joined Shopify about four years ago. In 2004/2005, if you wanted to set up an online store, you really had limited options. You could post a product on eBay or Yahoo Stores, for example, but they were very templated and didnt give small businesses a lot of options in terms of flexibility, design and features. At the other end of the spectrum, you had platforms like Cactus Commerce and enterprise platforms, which would do everything under the sun but cost you half a million dollars to get that up and running. We looked at eCommerce through the lens of a small business: how do you simply launch an online store and get up and running and selling easily? So we started from a little coffee shop in Ottawa, and today its scaled into a leader in the space with over 120,000 stores in 150 countries. Four years ago, I think small businesses questioned whether they belonged online in a retail aspect. The evolution quickly came when a lot of the big competitors started disrupting the models of small businesses, and forced them to look at themselves in a different light and take ownership of their brand; not look at eCommerce as a feature but rather a necessity to grow and stay relevant as a business. Today as a small business, you can start an online store for less than $30.00 a month, be up and running in a couple of hours, having no HTML, CSS or programming experience, with a beautiful online store that can do everything. So eCommerce has become such an accessible tool to every small business and entrepreneur. If they were to go to Shopify and try and go through this process, theres a couple of friction points unique to the online experience, but are getting easier. If youre going to sell online, you want your customers to be able to transact. Transacting means youre going to have to interact with credit cards like Visa, MasterCard and American Express. Now even four years ago, getting the ability and privilege to actually accept Visa and MasterCard on your store, meant you had to be underwritten by the banks. Theyd have to do a personal ID check, have you fax in a birth certificate and do 7 to 20 vigorous investigations that youre not a fraudster. Tools like Stripe and Braintree have done a remarkable job of lowering the barriers for a small business to accept credit cards without having to prove theyve been in business for five years. About four, five months ago, we looked at all of the traffic on Shopify  over 100,000 small businesses and their online stores. For the first time ever, we found mobile traffic accounted for more than 50% of all of the eCommerce visits. Across many online experiences, if you want to check out on your smartphone, youre still restricted to having to pinch, zoom and enter a 16-digit credit card number and an expiry date on an experience that was designed for desktop. I think thats a huge nut a lot of these existing businesses are trying to crack. If you look at Apple Pay, Visa V.me, MasterCard Express and all these different wallets coming to play, you can use your fingerprint or voice activation to check out. So I think mobile is the future of browsing, but theres still a huge opportunity to improve conversion in the mobile experience. The key there is establishing and creating a truly robust brand. And one of the things easy for small businesses to do because its very cost-efficient and easy to use is social media. To give you an example, when we looked at the traffic that was coming to our stores from a social side of things, Facebook actually accounted for two-thirds of all visits from social media sites to Shopify stores. And what that meant was as long as you have a strong Facebook presence, you were hitting the number one platform that had the largest impact on referral traffic to your site. While Two-thirds of visits from social sites come from Facebook, an even higher percentage of orders (85%) do as well. So it shows you that anyone can create a Facebook page, and anyone can interact with their customers by creating great content and creating engagement throughout the buying process, as you eluded to, and thats a very important thing to recognize. So its a great thing to think about and really a great equalizer if youre looking at engagement. One of the reasons why Shopify was actually created was because as we were trying to sell snowboards in 2004 and 2005, we realized we didnt have a platform that we liked that could do it on top of just making a one or two transactions on eBay, which was a very transactional platform. One of the things that became apparent is that by owning the web store for our own brand, we have the ability post-transaction to communicate with that merchant on an ongoing basis. And the notion of having a CRM software that allowed us to track and hold on to emails or phone numbers that would allow us to reach out to the person every winter and say, Hey sir, its that that time of year. Do you have your boots? Did your feet grow? Do you need new boots? Do you have new binding requirements? That allowed us to continue the conversation throughout time, and not just at the end of the first transaction. Conquering the data challenge that will come from selling online in so many different places, is one I think a lot of merchants need to be aware of because it can be a nuisance. But it can also be your biggest asset if you interpret that data into action and information you could act on. Check out . Theres a free trial  no commitments. You can just go through and see if running an online business or online store is right for you.","Connie Certusi, the executive vice president and general manager for small business solutions for Sage Software, joined us for an exclusive 1-on-1 interview. The goal was to update small business owners and managers on what Sage is doing for small businesses. The purpose of these interviews is to hear from leaders who provide products and services you may not know of, to listen to their philosophies and to hear the latest developments coming down the pike. We conducted it as a Google Hangout, and videoed it. Below are some highlights from that interview, paraphrased in places. For the full interview, you can scroll down to the bottom and watch the Hangout video  about 25 minutes long. Sage is a global organization that provides business management software, services and solutions to small businesses  6 million across the globe. It is our goal  to provide solutions to  small businesses that help them to better automate their daily tasks, their administrative tasks related to accounting, related to payroll, related to inventory management. And ultimately we want to free up some time so they can focus on other things like growing their business, or finding new customers or maybe just get them home at a decent hour so they can spend some time with their friends and family. So we service small businesses with tools to help make them successful. A lot of [small business people] are working more. When we ask them how many hours they are working  37% said they are putting in 11 or more hours every week in their small business on both the weekends as well as during the week. And  43% said they are taking less vacation time. Theres an apprehension to hire. Theyre getting more done with less. Theyre putting in more hours. When [small businesses were] asked have you thought about giving up? a resounding 76 percent said No. I think its the spirit of businesses in the U.S. quite frankly. Even though theyve gone through some tough times, 56 percent still feel like theyre living the American dream. We are just getting started on the Sage Listens RV Relay. We have an RV that is going around to 16 cities around the U.S. A number of Sage executives and employees are traveling on this RV and meeting with small and medium sized businesses. Not only do we want to meet with the small businesses and understand their journey  what keeps them up at night and [take that information back to Sage].. but we want to shop locally on this tour. We are buying gas from small business customers, we are staying at hotels where we can of small business customers, we are eating at [small business-owned restaurants]. We want them to know that we are championing them in the community. [The Shop Local Challenge is where we] are asking everyone to shop local at least one day a week.  Make a concerted effort to find a small business in your area  to shop local at least one day a week. We are putting out the Challenge to our employees to do the same across the United States. There are tremendous impacts for shopping local  locally owned businesses  give back more to the community. They do this in a number of ways. Obviously if these locally-owned businesses are thriving they are hiring employees from that community. They are also [giving back] to the community from a charity perspective  they sell more products, they are paying more taxes that goes back into the local infrastructure. Its a domino effect  as to the impact they can have on the community. We have a number of accounting, ERP, payroll, HR solutions  that focus  all the way from the entrepreneur/ single-employee space going all the way up to the 500-employee space. Weve got cloud solutions  Sage One  that is a full-cloud online accounting solution that targets the 0 to 9 employee space. From Sage One you can then move into Sage 50  [it] spans up to the 25 to 50 employee space. You can move up to Sage 100  then Sage 300  a number of solutions that help the small business really not only when they are first forming but as they continue to grow and their needs are changing.

Let me provide some examples and you tell me when it sounds familiar. When are you going to rewrite your site content? After the first of the year! When are you going to try out social media? After the first of the year! When are you going to ? After the first of the year! Guess what.  Thats Monday.  And were all in the same boat.  Below are some tips for how to make good on all those well-intentioned promises you told yourself, your site and your customers during the last quarter of the year. Come January 1, all the excitement you had toward your new projects may soon turn to fear as you have to actually on all the cool things you promised to do.   Jumping into social media where people may not accept you can be scary. Retackling the call to actions on your site may be intimidating. But thats not reason to drag you feet getting to it.  Lose that attitude and let go of last years baggage. Its a New Year. Anything is possible. Dont waste time making up reasons you cant do something. If your plan is to revamp the content on your local caf Web site, break it down into smaller projects that are more manageable and easier to knock off. You dont have to fix the whole site at once. Next week rewrite the Food section on your site.  Then tackle the Drinks. Then Events.  Then the Photo Gallery. Then the home page. Or, if your goal is to get involved in social media  start with one account on one social networking site. Dont try to create them all at once. Whats important isnt that you create a huge project for yourself to accomplish, its that you look at the year as a 12 month process and plan out your To Dos accordingly. Put due dates on all those mini projects that you create. You may not need to have the whole site rewritten in a weekbut if youre in same place in March you have a problem. Personally, I like to map out my year.  Obviously things are going to come into play that will shift your schedule, but I like to get 5 or 6 six big projects for the year on paper and then put them into my calendar early so I know what Im working on and when.  Scheduling the work I want to get done helps make me accountable for it. Another way to hold yourself accountable is to tell people what youre planning to do. Announce on your blog that youre going to be working on an overhaul of your site and adding new features.  Tell your Twitter followers that youre working on putting together a Facebook fan page.  Put it the announcement of a new company blog right at the top of your email newsletters.  Making your plans public (assuming youre not giving away competitive intel) is a great way to keep yourself on track and remind yourself of the promises you made in January.   Its a lot easier to get that blog out when you know people are waiting for it. Im asked a lot how I blog every day.  The secret is that its not talent or hard work or a sign that Im even particularly good at it. Its habit. Its about telling yourself that from 12pm to 3pm youre going to sit down and bust out a few blog entries.  Thats how you become a small business owner who blogs. Or, if you want to become a social media maven, its about telling yourself that at 7pm on Thursdays youre going to open up Twitter for an hour and talk to people for 90 minutes. The more you can develop habits for everything you want to get done, the more youre able to make it a seamless part of your day. The secret to being whatever you want to be is to identify the actions that accomplish that, and then form the habit. Thats all you have to figure out. The best way to keep all your promises for next year? Dont wait until next year to start. Waiting until Monday just ups the pressure and creates more fear around what you want to get done.  Bypass all that by starting now and getting a jump on the year.  Maybe youll be able to knock a small project off your list before 2010 even starts!  What resolutions have you made for your business this year and how are you going to accomplish them?","WordPress is a trusted website building and blogging platform thats proven popular among small business owners.

Originally bought by Yahoo for $100 million as Associated Content in 2012, the Voices site, and the Contributor Network which supplied it with writers, were sources of low cost content, what some would call a content farm. But following Googles Panda algorithm, which targeted and downgraded what Google considered low quality content, 75,000 articles were deleted, Matt McGhee of Search Engine Land. The rest of the content was transferred to a new site called Voices. The site paid as little as $5 per article mostly in Performance Payments from ad revenue for crowdsourced content. And some of these were the kinds of often-criticized posts with titles like Guide to Reducing Stress in Daily Activity or Five Hollywood Career Revivals Waiting to Happen, Ad Age at the time of the purchase.

Pinterest users scan through their friends streams for pinteresting items and 90% of the information they go through is visual. We all know ; Therefore making sure your images will be pinned and (whats more vital for this very article) re-pinned is well worth the effort. Pinterest grabs all your friends images together, resizes them into thumbnails and throws them to your friend stream. Whenever you login and go to your home page, you just scan through those images as you scroll. If there is anything blurry and unclear, you wont probably waste your time on it. Therefore, make sure your image is readable when its 192 pixels wide. Compare: : When , do a quick exercise by resizing your image to 192 pixels and make sure it looks good. : Of course, theres no rule to fit all cases.

Along with awareness and education, tech innovation is one of the primary means to address this challenge. Of the 7 billion people living in the world today almost 5.8 billion lack any form of access to scientific healthcare, says Vikram Damodaran, the Chief Product Officer for Sustainable Healthcare Solutions at . Vikram leads the Centre of Excellence for Affordable Healthcare Solutions serving emerging markets that drive the creation of the Affordable Care portfolio and Global New Market Commercial Activation initiatives. His primary focus is on identifying the most pressing healthcare needs, incubating solutions, attracting seed investments and business model innovation for commercial scalability of these solutions. spoke with Vikram about affordable healthcare, sustainability and GE Healthcares efforts in the direction at the  in Bangalore. Here are some excerpts: In the context of affordable healthcare we derive challenges by looking at the population of the world that has no access to scientific healthcare. This boils down to communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases. In emerging markets, the visible trend shows a decline in communicable diseases due to targeted interventions and support received from multiple funding organizations like WHO and even the government. In the case of non-communicable diseases be it cardio vascular, oncology and so on, intervention needs to be broad spread and at the same time it needs to be targeted. In the context of this background, the four primary sectors of healthcare that we focus on are: - With 70 million cardiac patients in India every year and with 150 cardiologists graduating every year, it is impossible to bridge the gap. This requires solutions that not only make the cost of cardiac care come down but you also need to be looking at an ecosystem of solutions that can help bridge expertise gap. - India alone has 3 million registered incidents in a year. But if you look at the unregistered events of cancer it is believed to be close to 10 million and that is growing to epidemic proportions. - We produce 30 million babies every year, we joke saying we are producing an Australia every year but we lose a lot of babies every year. Globally a million babies die the same day that they are born, and a lot of this has to do with education and awareness rather than actual clinical intervention. One area that complements all these three is the availability of affordable and cheaper drugs and vaccines. It is the fourth area of focus and it does not come under a disease per se but it is something that will serve all three areas I mentioned. As part of our Affordable Healthcare Portfolio we launched about 25-26 products about five years ago. The aim is to build products that are clinically good enough to deliver efficacious care but at a cost point that is extremely disruptive in nature. Our lullaby warmer prime for example, meant to take infant care to the masses, is a product designed for use in a primary healthcare setting. However, even when rooms full of equipment were given to a primary healthcare center, the nurses did not use the products. This got us thinking and the biggest learning from this exercise was that awareness or cheaper products alone are not the solution; cost is just one small cog in the wheel. It is more about the ecosystem required to use them sustainably. One needs to understand the barriers to adoption as far as the nurse is concerned. With the lullaby warmer we have addressed those issues. The bassinet in the warmer has an east-west configuration because when we presented a nurse with a cardboard box with north-south configuration, her concern was that she carries the baby in east west configuration and to put it into the warmers bassinet she would have to move the baby from east-west to north-south configuration and in doing so may drop the baby. Another simple example that will never show up in market research is the cable used to monitor babies temperature. The wire needs to be sanitized every time it is removed from the babies skin. It wears and tears and then replacement takes time. We have replaced the nylon wire with Kevlar, a material used in bulletproof vest. Often it is not about keeping the cost low but finding the perfect solution. 30 million babies are born in India out of which 8 million are born at home and in many cases without the help of health line workers, ASHA workers or mid wives, it is usually the local who tries to deliver the baby. Getting people to the health centers needs more than technology and facilities. It needs awareness and incentives. For example, in rural areas women are given money, say Rs. 1000 for a delivery and 3000 for a C-section if they walk into the community healthcare center. Once the community realizes the benefits of the health centre then a chain reaction will set in. Personally I have seen a spurt of activity in the sector in the last five years. The government had invested a lot of money into tech incubation and many agencies that are investing a lot of money for local innovators to focus on med-tech. There has also been increased participation of the academia. We have direct collaboration with IIT madras in their healthcare incubation centre. The idea of partnering with them is that they bring us amazing resources in terms of engineering skills, scientific skills that can help accelerate innovation. As the government funds them it gives us access to primary care challenges, which would otherwise not be in our direct line of sight. Another way of resource creation is bring tech and med schools closer to create cross-pollination of ideas. When you look at and MNCs like us one way to create acceleration is to host events like these, create an open innovation platform where it is not about the innovation that comes out but about creating a mindshare for people to get into the med-tech space. Interestingly the VCs for example have also started changing their mindset towards investing towards med-tech. Its one thing to invest in food commerce and food delivery and it is a completely different thing to invest in med-tech and I think that shift is happening slowly. Also we are trying to get to the roots by conducting these empathy tours to bridge the gap. Our engineers spend a month or more in rural areas to first hand understand the problems people face. This will help them create better and sustainable solutions. From my perspective the few mega trends that we will see will be that patients will no longer be consumers. And as with any consumer, the consumers in healthcare will own what they want to do in healthcare, it will not be about availing services and paying a fee. It will be about prevention. I think the age of prevention is not too far away. Consumer will be able to choose how much to pay for what outcome and with the amount of big data analytics, sensor tech and all pervasive mobile tech available, many incredible things will happen. Another mega trend will be that the ecosystem for healthcare- insurance, government, healthcare providers, everything will come together and work towards outcome based health care and not fee for service healthcare and that change will possibly be the pivotal point in the way healthcare will be delivered globally Given these kinds of trends for a technology company, what it means is that things will become more consumer centric in our approach and bring the patient more close to the innovation roadmap. I think we need to break the legacy of long-term incubation. We have to invest in med-tech and the barriers to investing in med-tech need to break down. Also for investing in med-tech you need deep pockets and the desire that return will not be in terms of money but the final impact had to be about saving millions of lives. That equation takes long periods of time and incubation and that needs to change. Benefit to participation equation needs to become clear, today it is not clear. It is a niche industry and participation will change when there is more clarity about the benefits of participation.","does not have to identify sevenonline reviewers who posted critical comments about a carpet cleaning business, the Virginia Supreme Courtrecently (PDF). Based on procedural grounds, this ruling is viewed as a big win for Free Speech. However, there are clear implications for small businesses too. With no single set of laws in place to determine whetheranonymous online comments are protected by the First Amendment or not, the landscape is constantly evolving. Small business owners need to understand privacy laws in the states in whichthey conduct business. Virginia courts lack jurisdiction to subpoena Yelps data becausethe information is in California, where the company, an onlinepublisher of crowdsourced reviews about local businesses, is based, the court ruled. JosephHadeed, owner of Hadeed Carpet Cleaning, sued seven anonymous Yelp reviewers critical of his company in 2012. Hadeed alleged that his revenue was hurt because of the comments and that the people posting them were really competitors pretending to be Hadeeds customers. Allegations of fake reviews on Yelp are nothing new. In November of 2014, an independent study claimed that . In September 2013, claiming it had created fake reviews for self-promotion. Around the same time, the against 19 businesses alleged to have created and disseminated deceptive reviews on sites like Google Maps, Yelp and CitySearch. In Hadeeds lawsuit, defendants named John Doe were charged with defamation, and Yelp received subpoenas demanding the names of the seven reviewers. Yelps response was that the reviewers had a First Amendment right to post anonymously  unless Hadeed proved they truly were competitors rather than customers. Several of the reviewers tied to the lawsuit (PDF) an Amicus brief confirming that they were actual Hadeed Carpet Cleaning customers and that their critical reviews were truthful. Hadeed actually had won the support of a Virginia trial court and the Court of Appeals, which held Yelp in contempt for failing to reveal the reviewers identities. But the business owner ultimately lost his case when the Virginia Supreme Court vacated the lower court decisions on procedural grounds. As state rule stands, the Virginia trial court could not order Yelp, based in another state, to produce the documents, also located in California. As the blog Socially Aware : If so, Yelp says it will continue to upload the anonymity of reviewers. On the official Yelp blog, senior director of litigation, Aaron Schur, : If Hadeed does attempt to enforce the subpoena in California, he may face the same result, only on different grounds. While Yelp would be subjected to a courts subpoena power, it likely would find protection in California court rulings which defend anonymous speech under the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment as well as the states constitutional right of privacy. Socially Aware : Companies continue to face legal proceedings involving the identification of anonymous users. In 2013, in Chevron v. Danziger, Northern District of California federal Magistrate Judge Nathanael M. Cousins (PDF) that Chevrons subpoenas seeking information about Gmail and Yahoo Mail users were enforceable against Google and Yahoo, respectively. The subpoenas in this case were not aimed at expressive activity but rather sought out subscriber and user information associated with email addresses. Twitter prevailed in a recent case, last month, when Northern District of California Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler (PDF) that plaintiffs could not compel Twitter to identify certain anonymous users. Music Group Macao sued the defendants in Washington federal court over anonymous tweets that the company believed were disparaging to its brand, its employees and CEO. The Washington court ruled in the companys favor, against Twitter. But Magistrate Judge Bheeler concluded that the defendants First Amendment rights to speak anonymously overshadowed the companys need to identify them. Federal courts in some states make it difficult for plaintiffs at the outset when filing lawsuits seeking to identify online anonymity. and require plaintiffs to include sufficient corroborating evidence to support their claims seeking to identify anonymous online posters. In some states, the bar is even higher for plaintiffs. The Delaware Supreme Court one of the highest standards, having ruled that setting the standard too low will chill potential posters from exercising their First Amendment right to speak anonymously. Socially Aware adds:","In the latest Star Trek movies, the brashness of the character Captain James Kirk is called into question as part of the characters arc. Kirk jumps into action, sometimes being reasonably insightful, other times questioning long established protocols. For a character that was invented in the 1960s, Kirks character, particularly in new millennium form, could very easily represent the personality of the American population born after 1980  called Generation Y or Millennials. This generation has experienced a convergence of unprecedented social and economic influences. While the Greatest Generation has been galvanized by the world at war, millennials are coming of age as computer-savvy enablers. They have witnessed perceived failures in government and organizations, and are imbued with more opportunity to share their viewpoint to the world. That viewpoint  75 million examples, roughly a third of the US population  was enough to influence a presidential election. As Rieva Lesonsky wrote in  , it is more than enough to influence your business. I share these observations to frame the purpose behind the book, by Diane E. Spiegel. Spiegel is a 25 year corporate training veteran who is a founding partner of The End Result Partnership, a consultation firm. I gained a review copy from the publisher and after reading it I felt more empowered in my working style especially if I were working with adults slightly younger than me. I now felt I understood them better. Spiegel explains how a confluence of influences has created some misconceptions  that Millennials are entitled, for example. Harboring those misconceptions can overlook opportunities to connect and misunderstand why millennials come to the workplace with different ideas. She writes, Every generation brings its collective experiences, complexities and expectation to the workplace. Immediately Siegel jumps into set-the-record-straight mode from her experiences: The book delves into specific instances in which Millennial values can influence the workplace. Millennials are ethnically diverse, less likely to hold a religious affiliation, and entrepreneurial aspirational as they have sought early careers during the global recession. The writing style is straightforward. I really like the metaphors that brought messages to life. Helicopter Parents are millennial guardians who fly low and hover over their children with respect to coaching, while Trophy Kids evokes pride in accomplishments. But the terms, like the suggestions, are not meant to be pejorative. They elaborate on the complexity of Generation Y with respect and add clarity to the recommendations. For example, Millennials value trust. This is not new in Spiegels view. In using social media, they rely on transparency to decide their expressions and communication style. Spiegel suggests how to establish trust: This approach can help in discussing controversial personal choices, such as a Millennials tattoos. The topic can seem too esoteric an instance, but Spiegel uses it and others to explain links to business-relevant observations. A study-noted the penchant to delay adulthood rites like marriage and home buying becomes understood against ideas such as aforementioned immediacy of contributing. Millennium Minutes provide thought-provoking asides in each chapter, reminders of what takeaways can aid your business. Ultimately the text in initiates a valued discussion of generational workplace values and the shifts that are significant to the bottom line. I can imagine the book aiding budding HR resources at a startup with a few years under its belt. It is also useful for small business owners who have young employees or interns. For the best blend in developing teams, add this book to your library of resources to make a difference to the people who matter most in your business.","Getting your business or product green certified may seem like a smart way to show your customers and prospective customers that you adhere to environmentally friendly practices. You could end up spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a green label thats worthless or, worse, hurts your reputation. More organizations and consulting firms are introducing green labels and certification programs. The idea is to make it easy for consumers to see which businesses follow eco-friendly practices or meet a rigorous set of sustainability standards. Such programs often appeal to small businesses that need help navigating the evolving world of sustainability and perhaps believe a label adds some credibility to their efforts. Yet, some certification programs arent as valuable as others, nor as reputable. (Read about a recently penalized by the Federal Trade Commission.)Some, such as , may require intense assessment of a businesss practices before providing certification. Others may require little or no assessment at all. Theyre just a marketing gimmick: Fork over $200 in order to get a window cling or a website listing signifying youre a green business. You want to make sure youre dealing with a reputable certification program that will ultimately add value to your business, and not suggest youre simply greenwashing your image. So what to do? Here are some tips when it comes to deciding whether a green certification program is right for you: 1. Several online resources can help vet green certification programs or at least direct you to reputable ones. Consumer Reports offers a helpful where people can look up and read about environmental labeling programs.The U.S. Small Business Administration also has a list of . Before signing up with any particular program, make sure to thoroughly research it online, such as checking with the . 2. Determine what kind of information and guidance you will get for going through the certification process. Are the steps ultra-simple, so youre basically just paying for the recognition? Or does it require a set of environmentally meaningful standards that are verified by the certifier? Also determine whether its a valuable recognition to have: Will your customers and prospective customers actually know and care about the green label? 3. Plenty of businesses effectively market their greenness without ever getting a label from a third-party organization. They do so by creating a dialogue with their customers. They use social media and creative marketing to tell consumers about why their products or practices are environmentally sound. They write and follow sustainability plans and post them on their websites. Its more authentic and more likely to pay off in the end.","Technology is a wonderful thing.

A tablet is also a good choice because it by allowing you to do things your laptop cant, such as using apps for paying and receiving invoices. Of course, youll still need a primary machine for storage, backups and heavy projects, but choosing the right mobile computer means you wont have to spend most of your working time chained to a desk. There are more WiFi hot spots than ever but they never seem to be around when you need them. Additionally, public Internet access is never secure.

And believe me  its not fluffy and feel good. Its practical, down-in-the-trenches-this-is-how-the-Internet-works kind of stuff. I get asked a lot of questions about digital marketing so its a good thing Ive got myself a review copy of because now I can answer basic questions like what kind of domain name to get as well as more complex questions such as how to create a powerful content plan. has it all covered in about 200 pages with lots and lots of charts, tables and specific how-to action items that will keep you on track to achieve your digital marketing goals. And practical tips?! There are so many of them I cant even begin to cover them here. But I will just give you a few from the pages Ive dog-eared on my copy: I could go on and on and believe me, each page of is loaded with insider tips and strategies that you would pay thousands for to a consultant. But more importantly, the value of this book lies in some great advice I got from Anita Campbell years ago; you dont have to be the one to DO IT ALL, but you DO need to know what is going on with your site. Every business owner needs to have a basic understanding of what certain internet strategies entail so that they can make good decisions. This is exactly what Joe Wozny delivers in","While it may have been an unfriendly economic climate over the past few years, small business owners are hopeful heading into 2011. Sixty percent of small business owners polled said they expect their business to swell over the next 12 months, signaling not only good spirits, but a 6 percent increase over December 2008. Thats according to a recent poll of 1,000 small business owners from across the United States. And what do SMB owners plan to do with the increased cash flow their businesses attract? According to the survey: Its not surprising to see that many small business owners will be looking to use the surge of cash to try and attract new customers. One of the largest pain points for small business owners is often trying to keep a steady flow of customers. In fact, Intuits survey found that 54 percent of SMB owners experienced a declining customer base over the past year, with another 32 percent naming delayed payments as their sore spot. Just because theyre having a hard time finding customers, though, doesnt mean SMBs are necessarily being proactive about seeking them out. The survey gave some startling numbers about small business owners usage of social mediaor should I say, their of usage. While 71 percent of small business agreed that social media is an effective way to keep customers engaged, they dont seem to actually be using it. The survey found: Ouch. So how are they promoting their businesses? Most continue to rely on word of mouth to get that job done. I guess well just have to hope those surveyed are among the 75 percent of SMB owners in 2011. One of the more interesting parts of the Intuit survey came when they asked small business owners to share their New Years resolutions for the upcoming year. Its always good intel to see where small businesses are looking to go next and what they think will have the biggest impact on their businesses. Heres where small business owners said theyll be spending their time in 2011. Thats where they going. Below is where they go if they had access to new lines of credit: How do Intuits findings compare with your own plans for 2011? Where will you be spending new resources next year?","If youve noticed the comments in your YouTube account are looking more like Google Plus these days, its not your imagination.YouTube recently announced roll out of a new comment section powered by Google Plus. In a post on the official YouTube Blog, product manager Nundu Janakiram and principal engineer Yonatan Zunger : Heres a brief video highlighting the basics of the new comment section: The new roll out stops short of being a full integration of the Google Plus comment section. However, comments from your Google Plus circles are given priority. So are comments from what YouTube calls popular personalities and the videos creator. Of course, if youd really rather see comments in the order they were added, you can do that simply by choosing the newest first option instead of the default top comments at the top of the comment section. Another feature similar to Google Plus lets you choose whether to share the comments you make in a video publicly or only with certain circles of your connections in the Google Plus social network. You can even share comments in your Google stream if you wish by choosing that option under the comment box. The new comment section also gives you more control over comments on your channel. You can either hold comments for approval or auto-approve comments from long-time trusted fans. You Tube says it will even allow you to block certain words from being posted in the comment section on your channel, a potentially helpful tool for moderating comments. The new commenting section should make YouTube ultimately more social. But only time will tell whether users and channel administrators want to spend time monitoring and maintaining yet another social media channel.","  LONDON The Bank of England swung into action on Thursday against the economic shock from Britain's vote to leave the European Union, cutting interest rates to near nothing and unleashing billions of pounds to cushion the Brexit blow. In what one bank dubbed a ""sledgehammer stimulus"", the BoE cut interest rates 25 basis points to 0.25 percent and said it would buy 60 billion pounds ($79 billion) of government bonds with newly created money over the next six months. It also launched two schemes, one to buy 10 billion pounds of high-grade corporate debt and another - potentially worth up to 100 billion pounds - to ensure banks keep lending even after the rate cut. The Bank said most BoE policymakers expected to cut the rate to even closer to zero later this year. ""By acting early and comprehensively, the (Bank) can reduce uncertainty, bolster confidence, blunt the slowdown and support the necessary adjustments in the UK economy,"" BoE Governor Mark Carney told a news conference. Sterling fell 1.2 percent against the dollar following the announcement, while British government bond yields hit record lows and the main share index rose by nearly 2 percent. Carney said he had unveiled an ""exceptional package of measures"" because the economic outlook had changed markedly following the Brexit vote. The Bank expects the economy to stagnate for the rest of 2016 and suffer weak growth next year. Finance minister Philip Hammond welcomed the rate cut and said he and Carney had ""the tools we need to support the economy as we begin this new chapter and address the challenges ahead"". Carney said he was not a fan of negative interest rates, and he also rejected boosting the economy though ""flights of fancy"" such as 'helicopter money', which is essentially handing out central bank money with no strings attached.  He added commercial banks had ""no excuse"" not to pass on the BoE's rate cut to their customers. The Bank's policymakers were not completely united on how to respond to the fallout from Brexit. The cut in rates and the measure intended to ensure banks passed it on to consumers - known as the Term Funding Scheme (TFS) - gained unanimous support. But three policymakers - Kristin Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale - opposed raising the target for quantitative easing government bond purchases to 435 billion pounds from the 375 billion total reached in late 2012. Forbes also opposed buying corporate debt - something the BoE did briefly after the financial crisis.  SLOWDOWN AHEAD While many business surveys show Britain's economy has slowed sharply and may even be entering recession, it is too soon for official data on how the EU vote is affecting output. But the Bank is clearly worried. ""It is clear (it) is concerned about the scale of the slowdown that is coming for the economy,"" said Nandini Ramakrishnan, a strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  The BoE left its forecast for growth this year steady at 2.0 percent, as the economy expanded faster in the first half of 2016 than it had expected in May. But 2017 brings a sharp downgrade to growth of just 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent - the biggest downgrade in growth from one Inflation Report to the next, exceeding what was seen in the financial crisis. The growth outlook for 2018 was cut to 1.8 percent. The BoE also revised up its inflation forecasts sharply, due to the big fall in sterling since the financial crisis, predicting it will hit 2.4 percent in 2018 and 2019. It said the costs of trying to bring it back to its 2 percent target in the immediate future would exceed the benefit. The Term Funding Scheme is designed to make sure that the lower levels of interest rates now set by the BoE are reflected in the costs commercial banks charge households and companies to borrow funds. Eligible institutions will be able to borrow four-year central bank reserves for an initial period of 18 months at rates close to the Bank Rate. The lowest cost of funding, the 0.25 percent Bank Rate, will be for banks that maintain or expand net lending to the economy and the BoE will charge a penalty rate if banks reduce net lending.

For those unfamiliar with the site, it is a resource allowing users to slice and dice all tweets dating back to the very beginning in 2006. On the site, users can sort through the estimated 500 million or so tweets made a day in a variety of ways. Topsys data collection is basically divided into three categories: By for a particular term or group of terms you can see the number of times it has occurred on Twitter over the past hour, day, seven days, 12 days or 30 days. You can also ask Topsy the number of all time mentions for a term. Then specify whether you are looking for the term in a link, tweet, photo or video. Or ask whether it was mentioned by a user considered to be an influencer. By up to three terms (brand names would be one example) you can determine comparatively how mentions of these terms have compared over the past month. If you choose Coke, Pepsi and Starbucks, for example (pictured above), youll see how popular each term was with Twitter users recently. You can also whether specific terms are trending with a large number of Twitter users. Simply enter your term in the social trends section. Then select the top 100, 1,000, 5,000 or 20,000 mentions. You can again select the kind of content you are seeking in tweets on the topic. In this video overview, Topsy co-founder and chief scientist Rishab Aiyer Ghosh explains how Topsy sorts data results: Apple has not been specific about its plans for the Topsy purchase.However, The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the sale, has .The analytics companys technology will likely be incorporated into the companys products. The service could be used to: In general, Topsy could help Apple better monitor social conversations about all its products. Bottom line: More data can benefit any company big or small, and analytics tools like Topsy can help companies make sense of conversations already going on in social media.","Managing your is like trying to climb the North Ridge of K2 with shorts, a t-shirt and a $20 pair of hiking boots from Walmart. It seems like the bigger your company grows, the more negative reviews pop up. The harder you work to resolve an issue, the more people seem to crop up all over complaining about how little effort and compassion your company has. This is just the way customer service works. No company has a perfect reputation. However, the easiest way to permanently tarnish your online notoriety is to: The following 3 tips are the foundation of any good online reputation management plan: This can be easier said than done if youre a one or two-person company. Still, how can you possibly manage your reputation if you dont know about the negative reviews being spread all over cyberspace about you? And finding out about them a year from now is way too late to do anything about them. Actively doing things to build a good reputation while leaving the bad unattended to is like building a house on a termite-infested foundation or filling your car tire with a hole in it every day before making a 200-mile commute. Eventually, the walls are gonna cave in. Or the tires going to blow out while youre driving 60MPH down a busy interstate during rush hour. Effective monitoring is a situation where you really want to outsource tracking to a company that specializes in scouring every blog, social account, image, etc., for anything good or bad being said about you. There are several companies who manage this sort of thing. Make sure youre hyper-vigilant about who you choose. If youre not yet at the point where you can afford to spend hundreds a month for real people to monitor whats being said about you, consider at least using some good reputation . Remember, once a problem is discovered  apologize. Once something is posted online, its going to be there conceivably forever  or until there isnt a single power-grid left on the planet. Whether were talking about review sites or online forums, you cant ignore any of them. You could try hiring a reputation management firm to help you push down negative reviews on search engine result pages, but that doesnt solve the underlying problems. Remember, your customers are your best evangelist, so you have to be sincere in your effort. An apology is always the best answer to any negative review. Say youre sorry and make it clear that the customer can contact you anytime to resolve their issue  with a direct phone number and email whenever possible. This not only helps quell the negative reviewers. Itll help bolster your reputation for years to come, as people who Google you will not only see that there was a definite complaint, but also that you showed your companys worth by actively responding to, and working to solve whatever the issue was. The truth hurts many business owners who decide to engage (negatively) with customers who may just be lying to the rest of the world about their experience with you and your company. The fault here is becoming too emotionally invested in the situation and thinking that your righteousness will prevail. When the reality of the situation (i.e., company vs. jilted customer) dictates it wont. Yes, there may be folks wholl say they tried to contact you 12 hours-a-day, 6 days-a-week for a months time, and you or your customer service team was nowhere to be found. They claim to have given up giving you the chance to rectify their issue. Perhaps in reality, they called once to complain and you offered a perfectly fine solution to their problem  but never heard back from them again til the offending review popped up on the radar. You know the customer is wrong, contrary to the opposing view that theyre always right. You sign up for an account on the review site and go about setting the record straight, telling everyone politely that the customers wrong, even giving supporting evidence to back up your claim. Surely any intelligent person will agree that you have every right to defend yourself. This persons trying to hurt you  theyre giving you no choice but to tell the truth. However, all this practice will accomplish is to tell readers that youre unapologetic and know nothing about turning a wrong to a right. And that when and if they have a problem, youre going to blame them and offer no reasonable resolution. When you think about going on the defense  apologize instead. Probably. There are tons of potential tips, tricks and tools for managing your reputation. The fact is that if youre always monitoring, responding and making sure you dont get emotionally invested or too truthful about how things really were/are between you and the Negative Nancys leaving bad reviews about you  youll already be better than most of your competition. Oh yeah, and did I forget  always apologize. Who cares if theyre wrong. You know it, your staff knows it, your wife or husband probably knows it too. Youll never be successful in customer service (which inevitably defines your online reputation) if you cant humble yourself to the collective crowd of prospective customers reading/listening to everything said about you.","Im fortunate in that Im both a small business owner and a writer. But I know a lot of you may not be writers. You might have dreaded your Comp class in college, or you might now grind your teeth at the thought of writing even just a paragraph. The problem is: If you dont have a big budget for marketing or writing, youll have to bite the bullet and do it yourself. Fortunately, you dont have to jeopardize your business reputation with poor writing. There are a few ways to ramp up your skills, whatever they are, and look like a burgeoning business whos hired a professional writer to do the job. It might seem a strange place to start, but the more copy you read, including Web copy, blog posts, emails, books, articles, whatever, the better idea youll have for the style you can use in your own writing. Here are a few places you can start: Theres nothing complex about writing a webpage title or a blog post. But there are some style and formatting points youll want to pick up. The more you write, the easier it becomes. My two favorite resources for writing tips are: Dont be apprehensive at this step. No one has to see what you write. You just want to get into the practice of writing. Model your article, Web copy or email after one youve found that you really like. Implement the rules and guidelines you learned in step 2. Then walk away from it for at least a few hours. Now that youve had your espresso and read the newspaper, come back and reread your copy. Tweak whatever needs a little work. Theres no shame in editing multiple times. Just dont keep it in a perpetual state of edits. This is probably more about your lack of confidence than your writing really needing tons of work. Once youve got something youre fairly proud of, share it with your coworkers, friends, or family. Ask questions, and be willing to accept the feedback: Use this feedback to make additional edits to your work if necessary. I know, this is the scary step. Other people will read it! But remember: Nothings permanent in the world of digital copy. Post it to your site for a few weeks, and pay attention to your traffic, clicks, and conversion. If it goesdown after you post it, try again with the copy. If it goesup youre on the right track. Your goal is to draw more people to your site, get more clicks, and bring in more customers and your copy is the key to that. If youre sending an email, you can try an to see which copy is most appealing to your subscribers. When youre a tiny small business, you have to wear many hats. But thats no excuse for your writing hat to have holes in it. With just a little practice, your writing can be on par with a professional (and costly) writers and you can be well on your way to creating professional quality writing.","  (Adds Cobalt International, Cofco, Space Communication,

I have started about 20 businesses and failed at 17 of them. I have failed as a husband, as have many. I hope I dont fail as a parent but certainly some people would look at my track record and say, yes, yes indeed, he failed as a parent. Im not the best boyfriend. One time I broke up with a girlfriend while I was on the elevator up to meet her in her apartment. I just hit the down button and never spoke to her again. But I also have had a few successes. Here is what failures do: We dont live long enough to fail. Like if a planet is around for 4 billion years and produces no life-forms, I would call that planet a failure. Everything else is an experiment. Thomas Edison never said, I failed 10,000 times before I made a lightbulb. The guy was in a LABORATORY. He experimented. And now everyone gets into failure porn and says Im a failure. Thats BS! John Coltrane didnt fail when he couldnt stay in Miles Davis quartet. He was experimenting with Miles Davis style but ultimately, with 20 years of practice and study under his belt, he knew that only his unique style could survive and flourish in his own quartet. He experimented, learned from the experiment and moved on. HERE is the key on experimenting: THE MORE MISTAKES YOU MAKE THE BETTER YOU GET. Why is this? It's brain science: when you make a mistake, you repeat and repeat until you get it right. This repetition is ""practice"". Practice makes perfect. People who just get it right the first time (e.g. when I sold my first business) never learn all the subtleties you learn with practice. So they get fooled into thinking that ""luck"" equals ""good"" when actually ""mistakes + repetition = good"". Everybody is told a lie: to be a success you have to under promise and over deliver. This is the worst form of lack of integrity. The idea is that you are safe. Lets say you under promise and you under deliver. You think, incorrectly, hey, at least I have my integrity intact. No, you have nothing intact. You are just like everyone else. There are 3,000,000,000 employees on the planet and they are all under promising and most of them are under delivering. You are just like them. You have to: OVER PROMISE AND OVER DELIVER Over-promise sets you apart from the people who under-promise. Over-deliver sets you apart from people who just delivered. It's not that hard to do both. (It's easy to slightly over promise and slightly over deliver because nobody else is doing it). Try it and you will see the results. its amazing. They left their important project on the subway. They are sick. Their dog got sick. They broke up with their girlfriend or boyfriend. Theres a way to minimize accidents and its called health. You cant succeed if you are sick in bed. You cant succeed if you spent all night the night before reading your wifes emails because you cant trust her. You cant succeed if you arent grateful for being given at least the chance to be something better than what you are now. When someone consistently has a lot of excuses for why something has gotten done, I know they are not ready for the next step. When I was young, I was the man with the excuses. I had them every day. I was a master of them. But I fooled nobody. And so I was given less opportunities for success. And you know what: I was right! If Im reading my wifes email and shes cheating on me, I deserve to fail. So heres what you do: You cant be perfect. But every day: - Move, Eat, SleepWell - Improve your relationships (Call a friend, surprise a spouse, be kind to your kids) - Be creative (only you know how to do this but at least write 10 random ideas a day) - Be grateful for where you are. (and this is the Now that people brag about) Bobby Fischer always took it to the next level. Nobody ever thought he was the greatest talent in chess history. He probably had average talent. But he always said, ""how can I take chess to the next level"". When he was a kid he learned Russian so he could read the Russian chess magazines. After that, he never lost a US Championship. He was 13 years old. He was so much better than the Americans he even stopped playing in the US championship. And he took it to the next level right up until the world championship. For the first time in his life he played a different first move. His opponent, the older world champion had ONLY prepared for the one move Fischer ever did. So Fischer came up an entire new opening with a new first move. Gandhi took it to the next level. Every revolution before him was done with violence. He experimented. He had a vision. He felt that 300 milllion Indians didnt need to do violence. He was right, despite everyone disagreeing with him. Take the advice of everyone around you, and then take it to the next level. Practice taking it to the next level (because at first you wont be good). Come up with your ideas but then think, ""What has never been done before"" (it's not true that everything has been done before. Only shadows of things have been done before). But do it over and over again and you will be THAT PERSON that knows how to take things above and beyond. 5) FAILURES TAKE ALL THE CREDIT Failures are insecure. When they do their little stupid thing at work they want the credit. Give others credit all the time. Then you are the source of credit. Just like a bank. When people want more credit, who do they go to? They go to you! Just like they would go to the bank when they need more money. Credit is like currency. If you're the bank, then in the long run you will end up with all the real credit. I dont mean be honest. Thats obvious. How do you take honesty and integrity to the next level? You become vulnerable. You admit mistakes before you have to. You offer people their money back when you've lost it and didnt have to. I was talking to Ev Williams who started Twitter. When his older company, Odeo, wasn't working out - he and his board decided to give everyone their money back before moving on. That's integrity. Nobody has ever given me my money back. You give advice and help people when you sincerely want them to do better. Do this every day. It adds up. No, it doesn't add up. It multiplies. It compounds. Theres negative integrity and positive integrity. Negative integrity is saying to your boss: I failed because I missed the train. Positive integrity is, I like your idea for A, B, C reasons but how about you give a chance to X, Y, and Z and I bet we can make your idea a huge success to your boss. And then you give your boss total credit. Remember, these rules dont live in isolation. Its all one big rule. Its all about you being a vessel for a vision. People live for 75 years on average. But a vision can live for millenia. I thought there was only ONE rule about money: making it. So I lose it all. Because first I had to learn there are three rules to money: Making it. Keeping it. Growing it. Making it is what we deal with for a long time. We need to pay the bills. We need to reduce money anxiety in life. But many people who are failures think that once they make it, the job is over. I thought my job was over when I had millions in the bank. So I stopped being healthy. So I stopped being nice to the people around me. So I spent money on a penthouse apartment and buoght art and got a house in Atlantic City and started gambling after taking helicopters back and forth. So I put money in every investment possible just to impress people. And then I had $143 left and I was dead broke and blame myself for the deaths of at least two people. When you make money, keep it. Dont even invest it. Put it in the bank. Dont be greedy for more. You only need to get rich once. Unless you want to buy a basketball team you dont need to get rich twice. And only when you are confident you can Keep it, you can THINK about growing it. But that takes a year or two first of keeping it. Please trust me on this one. Almost every failure I know (and I know a lot) didnt fail because they couldnt make money. They are broke now because they couldn't keep it. I have a very good friend who is a brilliant brilliant scientist. Maybe the most brilliant man I know. I would tell him this to his face: you have no follow through. He has an idea. Everyone says its amazing! AMAZING! You are so SMART! He gets about 30% of it done. And then he is on to the next Brilliant idea. BRILLIANT! His kids live on food stamps. And every single one of his ideas is not just a million dollar idea. But a TRILLION dollar idea. Im not exaggerating. But he cant follow through. The next idea is always bigger. Thomas Edison didnt say, I did it! when he made the light bulb. He called up the mayor of New York and worked out a deal to light up downtown New York City. The first city in history to be lit up at night by electricity. He got paid for that. He made a company. He followed through. He got rich. That's the difference between Edison and Tesla, who was probably smarter in every way than Edison but died penniless. If you have trouble following through, delegate. But dont forget the other rules above: Over deliver. Integrity. Health. etc. I carry at all times a waiters pad. I have over 100 waiters pads. In my pocket right now is one. In the table next to where I sleep is one. Saul Bellow once said, you never have to rewrite what you write in the middle of the night. How many times do you think of a great idea and you think, this is so GREAT I will never forget it and then you forget it. It happened to me this morning. Claudia and I were talking last night and she said, You have to write this down! and I said, there is NO WAY Im going to forget this.  Well, I forgot it. I pray to the gods of memory I will remember it but I forgot it. I say, on average, 10,000 words a day. I ALREADY know the things Im going to say. They already got to my brain somehow. And now I'm just waiting to vomit them out. When you listen, you learn. When you learn, you get better. When you get better you start to have a vision, you start to over deliver, you get more creative, and all the other good things above. Im going on a word diet. 2500 words a day. MAX. I might not succeed (its an experiment) but Im hoping I learn more today. And tomorrow. Listening is a form of giving credit. It means you value the words of other. Listening is a form of integrity. Because everyone offers something, you acknowledge that. Listening is a form of improving relationships with others. Listening is a way to outsource good ideas since if you let many others talk, some of them will give you good ideas you might not have thought of. Buddha didnt start a major religion by talking. It started because he sat under a tree and listened. Jesus spent 40 days in a desert. Listening. Moses listened to his wife (err.I mean a burning bush). Everything that has moved history happened because of listening instead of talking. Talking inspires. But listening creates the inspiration. - I can say break all of the above rules is the final rule. But Im not going to say that. You know why? Because this is not bullshit. This is not about how to fail or to succeed. You can read those rules in a birthday card. This is how I failed and succeeded. I hope I can die now without any more pain.","Developers of the app   have made big news lately, and not in the usual way. Google the app  twice  from the .

For Shashank Chourey grew up with indulgent parents, in a middle class Brahmin family home in Indore. Life took a turn when the 13-year-old boy fell in love with computers. He would play games on it all night; miss his school exams. Coding became his cocaine. Hacking was a high among friends he made in chat rooms. Every coder worth his salt wanted to be a hacker. It didnt take Shashank long to rise up the ranks. He found a steady source of income at crackpal.com, where the pay was $50 to hack into an email account. He continued the hacking business during his first year of engineering college. I hacked into more than 40 Indian government websites and more than 100 big corporate websites in less than 18 minutes. That included NTPC tenders, the Delhi Government official site and so on. I sent a report on their poor cyber security to CERT and NIC, but they were least interested, Shashank recalls. He tracked viruses, wrote one algorithm after another, and for about two years. Web security was billed to be the next big thing but it was hard to make money on it above board. He was one of those experts on IRC Chat networks  where all the bad internet activities are done.   name them and they are all there. Big companies hire on the sly here, he says. He did their bidding for a year almost and realised that it wasnt his cup of tea. I found that work too risky or too bad. Although I was doing big things by then, I knew hacking into emails and such stuff wasnt what I wanted to do. College too wasn't his cup of tea; he found the curriculum way too boring and dropped out in the second year. All of us know . But in India, being a college dropout isn't a dreamy prospect. His parents didn't scold him but neighbours never missed a chance to snigger. What to do next? Why not be a web security consultant with a company? He thought it was a good idea to boost his resume with corporate experience and earn a decent living. The best way, he could think of, to land the job was to hack into a company website, something big enough to impress the employer. I figured out the best company to work for in Indore then, hacked into their clients website, and exposed its vulnerabilities to sell them my services. I gave them a business idea, including the resources required. I was appointed then and there. He worked there for a year and a half, got three promotions, and quit as a project manager because another company offered him a bigger pay packet. After 45 days at the new job, he didn't see any salary. There was no prospect of salary coming in the following days as well. So I quit with just Rs 5000 in my pocket. On 23 February 2009, Shashank walked out of that office at 5 pm. . At 8 pm, I got a data entry project, PSD to Excel, for which the pay was $18. I stayed up all night and finished the job by next day on my Pentium 3 computer at home. He worked through days and nights picking up projects online. The idea was to earn enough money to startup. In a month, he was able to buy another computer, rope in a friend to work with him, and soon, another computer and one more friend was in. Both these friends had completed their engineering by then and hadn't found a job yet. These friends soon left him for lucrative jobs, but by then Shashank had found his footing in search engine optimisation. In October 2009, he started up India Infotech with a small team. Soon he realised the gulf between running a service-based company and a product-based one. If we had to get bigger, we had to get into product. But with very limited amount of money, getting into the product business was not possible. Then we came up with a solution: sell product as a service. That's how the startup evolved into a specialized ecommerce website development company offering a wide array of affordable SEO services to clients all over the world. We created a SEO process flow, which is more or less the same for most of the clients. This model helped us to execute bulk projects using the assembly line execution method with less resources. We kept our eyes on the ball to maintain the retainership with our clients. We still work with three out of our first five SEO clients, Shashank says. For over a year, he used to stay in his office all through the week, though home was just 7 kilometres away in the same city. I used to live in my office just to make sure I could spend more time working. By February 2014, five years since According to Shashank, working on several projects simultaneously  they take up around 300 projects every month on average, and this month they have 425 on hand  works to their advantage. Their target being the SEO segment, they rely on external factors like changing Google algorithms, fluctuating online marketing trends and so on. When we work on a huge number of projects, we can invest more money and resources into research. And so, we can weather negative market conditions, he says. According to his project manager Abhinav Sharma, at the last count up to February 2014, they have delivered more than 10,000 successful SEO projects. Today, India Infotech has more than 4000 clients. We have optimised our business model to generate maximum profits. So our revenue margins are very high as compared to any traditional company, he says. Two-thirds of India Infotech's business comes from the US. The Wall Street Journal pegs the digital marketing industry at about . As more businesses are moving towards paid optimization / paid ads from organic optimisation, Shashank believes that social media optimisation is going to be revolutionary in digital marketing.  . The video ads market is going to be huge, he says. As in most startups, hiring is a huge challenge. The problem with me is that I trust people very easily and I trust blindfolded. I believe if you cant trust people working with you, then you better dont work with them. He has had quite a few bitter experiences with this. Nine months into the company, he found that his friends  also his first recruitees  were working for his rivals behind his back.  . A similar incident happened a year back. I guess I haven't learnt enough from those experiences as I still trust my team blindly. I am something of a perfectionist. So I expect reliability, discipline, energy, trust from the people with whom I work. I always make sure I work with an excellent team. No compromise. I dont waste a single day with a person who is not fit for the company. Earlier, working 18 hours a day was a routine for Shashank. Now, he is not that aggressive at work. At the company, now my job is to plan things, processes, methods of execution and so on. I still work for 8-10 hours a day. But I like to use my core strength in hacking and security to do some good for the planet and its people too, anonymously. Another thing that has changed is the look on his neighbour's face when he takes out one of his superbikes or shiny cars.","You are working your social media  religiously. Still, mistakes happen. The poorly timed Tweet. The politically sensitive Facebook image. The not-such-a-great-idea hashtag. The clever post that demonstrated to the world you dont follow current news. The unfortunate late Friday afternoon tweet when your social media manager forgot they were not on their personal Twitter account. Lets face itthings happen. Dont worry, you are not alone. Even big corporations and celebrities sometimes miss the mark: Learned a Twitter Q&A promoted as was not such a great idea when the Twitterverse was in the ripe mood to slam financial giants. Criticized when it promoted its whole-grain cranberry scone and healthy breakfast with atweet shortly after the tragic Boston Marathon bombing that read,  The company did tweet a prompt apology. Her sweepingly horrific tweet, proving some authors, celebrities and political pundits should be banned from social media until successful completion of a sensitivity course. Faced criticism for failing to provide a banner image on its LinkedIn company page  proving that even giants of industry sometimes need a nudge in the finer elements of social media marketing. With nearly 174,000 followers on LinkedIn, of which 18,346 are employees, Toyota still has a bland LinkedIn company page with no imagery to support its branding  and people are still criticizing. Viral retweet of a pornographic image from its Twitter account. The image was tweeted at least once in response to a customer who complained to US Airways in a tweet saying, You ruined my spring break, I want some free stuff. American Airlines, which is in the process of merging with US Airways, apologized for the inappropriate tweet. In US Airways defense, the tweeted porn ended up in the companys Twitter feed by accident. Major corporations, including IKEA USA, Home Depot and even Pepsi have felt the bitter sting of social media condemnation, all thanks to unfortunate hashtags, spelling errors, poorly timed jokes, funny pictures that were anything but funny and even attempts at crisis control  defensive marketing that ended up being little more than Twitter rants. Dont be afraid to say you are sorry. Mistakes happen. Humility is powerful. Show empathy. Show compassion. In shortshow you care! If a tweet or post was insensitive, or poorly timed, show grace in asking for forgiveness and do not feel the need to insert useless humor or make the situation worse by defending your position, especially if you know your social media post was in the wrong. Be timely in taking responsibility and showing a desire for clemency, even consideration. If you feel the tweet, post or share was not offensive or perhaps was misconstrued, share that with delicacy  not anger or defensiveness. You want to facilitate a harmonious resolution so that everyone comes away with neutrality, even tranquility. Patience is a wonderful attribute  and can be a significant tool in riding a social media disaster. Be patient with yourself, your social media manager and your social media team. Take the time to explore what went wrong  and why. Demonstrate a gentle cordiality. Be benevolent. Understand that your apology may take some time to settle in and be accepted, even appreciated. Do not feel the need to shoot out scores of social media posts and rapid-fire tweets in an attempt to change the vibe. Be mild and mindful, and keep any posts upbeat and loaded with good intentions. Courtesy under fire is a gift  bestow it to yourself and your social media campaign. Rejecting or denying that a social media disaster hit will not help you move forward. Take a philanthropic positioning  remember your social media platforms are a form of customer service and client care. With authentic decency, accept that something bad happened and work to improve the situation. Be sincere  dont fake it. Accept it, take the appropriate actions to arrive at an honest, genuine resolution and move forward. When all is tweeted and done, make sure you get what all the fuss was about in the first place. Learn from the experience. Grow from the experience. Use it to generate better social media posts and exchanges. If the trouble started because of a sadly timed seasonal tweet, be more present in your content creativity and be mindful of religious holidays, national days of observance and work to stay current with the news of the day. If you understand what went wrong, you will have gained a new empiricism and maturity. The result: Better social media engagement and a revitalized commitment to deliver superior, creative posts designed to please everyone.","Theres a lot of talk about how to find Twitter followers.  Though, you may have noticed, the conversation is typically about how to get people to follow to help increase your reach, build awareness and make new contacts.  But what if youre a small business owner just now entering the world of Twitter? Who should be following right out of the gate to help you get involved quickly and make the most out of your time on Twitter? Depending on your niche, many of your customers may already be on Twitter.  By identifying these people early, youll be able to jump right into listening to whats important to them and interacting with them on a regular basis.  You can find current customers on Twitter by searching by their e-mail address (if you have it) or by asking them to share their Twitter handle with you during surveys, purchases and any in-store interaction. Because we go to Twitter to talk to and interact with the brands we like, customers may be really excited to meet you on their favorite social network.  To help you find prospective customers, you can use Twitter Advanced Search to find people talking about your business or important keywords near a certain location, or use any of the local Twitter search engines like and or . Finding your competitors on Twitter shouldnt be too hard, assuming you already know who they are. You can take advantage of Twitters search function to scope them out by company name, owner/employee names and/or their e-mail addresses.  You may also want to check out their websites (business and personal) to see if theyre promoting their Twitter accounts (or any other social media accounts) via their home page or company newsletter. When it comes to following competitors, Id recommend following them through a private Twitter List unless you have a friendly working relationship with them. By following them on the sly, youll be able to keep tabs on their marketing strategies, see how theyre interacting with consumers and even find holes in their Twitter strategy that you can capitalize on. As a small business owner, you always want to be on the lookout for ways to and earn local buzz.   And the first step of that process means getting on the radar of the folks who report on your neighborhood and/or industry so they remember your name when it comes time to write a story.

By following them, you help yourself get on their radar. But more than that, they help stay on top of whats going on.  You may learn some valuable tidbits, find content worthy of sharing with your network, and build complementary relationships with these people. To find them, take a look at whose content is getting the most retweets (RTs) in your network, who people seem to be listening to, and the names that most often take office hours on Twitter. These are your industry-specific trendsetters and the people you want to follow. Its not all work. You also want to find people on Twitter who brighten up your day by sharing the best content, the best stories and the best tidbits about themselves.  By finding these genuinely interesting people, whether or not theyre relevant to your work network, youll find human and spice-of-life type content that you can share with your network. For example, maybe its your favorite comedian on Twitter, maybe its or .   You want to be more than useful to your audience; you also want to help brighten their day. When I help clients build up new Twitter accounts, above are five types of Twitter users that I help them find and immediately follow. Who else should small business owners be following on Twitter?","With so many potential customers on Facebook, and , its almost a must for businesses to have a presence there. If you want to know how to create a Facebook business page, but arent sure where to start, heres a simple step-by-step guide to help you get the most out of your new page. When you first select to create a new page on Facebook, you need to choose the category that your business best fits into. The options are: From there, you can narrow it down even further by specifying exactly what type of business you have within those categories. For example, you could specify that you run a food service business, real estate office or event planning business. Then just enter your businesss name to continue. Then its time to actually add information to your Facebook page. Theres a section that lets you add a few paragraphs  up to 155 characters,  to tell people what your page is all about. Theres also a section where you can add your website and even enter a custom URL for your Facebook page so that you can easily share your page with others. A profile photo can help you make your page stand out and fit with your companys branding. After you add your basic business info, youll be directed to a page where you can add a profile photo to your page. This can be your logo, a photo of yourself or your team, or even a promotional image. From there, you can add the page to your favorites so that it will be easily accessible on the sidebar of your Facebook homepage. But you can also specify the target audience for your page so that its more likely to get in front of the right people. You can outline your audience by location, age, gender, languages and even interests. You can search for specific interests or browse general categories like entertainment and hobbies and then see some more specific niches within those categories. Even though you may have already added a short description and website, there are some other details that might be helpful to your customers if included on your page. Once you have the basics set up, you can visit your page and add things like your address, phone number, business hours and price range within your pages About section. Your profile picture is just one small way to add some visual interest to your page. Youll also likely want to add a cover photo, which will appear at the top of your page. And you can also add other photos or albums of photos. Facebook even lets you upload videos or record live videos, which can also be saved on your page for visitors to watch later. Need ideas? for seven ways to find inspiration for social media content. You also have the ability to invite your Facebook friends to like your page. This doesnt mean you need to send a blanked invitation to everyone you know.

For example, if you really want to promote events held at your business, you might move that tab up to the top of the list. You can also add tabs other than the ones that automatically appear. One of the most popular sections among businesses is a shop section. By agreeing to Facebooks terms, adding a payment method, adding a way for people to contact you with customer service issues, and adding products, you can let people shop for your products without actually leaving Facebook. You can also add a specific call to action button toward the top of your page. Facebook offers several different options you might consider, depending on your goals for your page. For example, you can add a button that lets people contact you. You can set up one that directs them to a mobile app. You can have them book an appointment. Or you can choose from several other options.

Hybrids are tablets that double as laptops or desktops. They are still portable like a tablet, but larger than traditional tablets and come with keyboards. Hewlett-Packard is introducing its third tablet laptop hybrid. HP plans release in August of a 13.3-inch tablet laptop hybrid based on Windows  called the . At about 9 x 13 inches, the device offers a 13.3 inch display screen. Obviously, it is going to be heavier than smaller tablets. With the keyboard it weighs under 4.85 pounds, but weighs only 2.3 pounds as a tablet. Still, thats light enough to carry around with one hand. Like many newer tablets, it comes with two cameras: an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 1080 pixel front-facing camera. You can connect with WiFi. Bluetooth, MicroSD reader, USB and audio jacks make for this device s diversity and usefulness. The Split x2 is an upgradeto the ENVY x2, HPs first Windows tablet laptop hybrid introduced last year, . The Split x2 replaces the Atom processor of the ENVY x2 with a choice of a 3rd Generation Intel Core i3 or i5 processor. The screen is larger, too, with1366 x 768 resolution. The additional functionality also costs more. Cost of the new tablet laptop hybrid is $799.99 MSRP compared with $649.99 for the ENVY x2. This hybrid tablet  HP calls them a 2-in-1  comes out of the HP Consumer products group, but weve noticed that hybrids tend to get a second look from business users. Professionals want the mobility and fun of a tablet but really need a keyboard to make the device functional for work purposes. Also, Windows 8 systems hold special appeal for business users who may need to work on PowerPoint, Excel or Word files. That can be difficult if not impossible on a traditional touch tablet using a non-Windows operating system. What weve done this time is take that whole x2 approach and adapted it to something that gives you even more performance and more capability, said David Conrad, Director of Product Management at Hewlett-Packard in a video about the new device. But then weve also added one more thing, which is storage, he said. The earlier ENVY x2 offered 128 GB of solid state drive storage in the tablet. The Split x2 includes that memory plus an additional 500 GB of hard drive storage in the keyboard dock, said Conrad. HP also a 10.1 Android hybrid, the SlateBook x2, priced to rival the iPad. Other brands have to the market, too. After some struggles in recent years, HP, one of the largest computer companies, has experienced a bit of a turnaround with sales higher than expected in the second quarter of 2013.","At Ambit we spend a lot of time reading articles that are not directly relevant to Indian stocks. However, since the Indian economy is now umbilically linked to its global counterparts, the articles that we come across have relevance for Indian stocks and the Indian economy. In that context, this report contains the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week. 1. Were paying our CEOs all wrong ( Source: Bloomberg.com ) The article argues that compensation plans for CEOs may have no empirically demonstrated validity. In the 1990s pay experts favoured the use of stock options. Later awards of stock that vest over time became popular. Now, a full third of pay is triggered only if CEOs hit performance targets. Increasingly, that target is simply a higher stock price. Many critiques of CEO pay focus on the pitfalls of short-term thinking, with examples of leaders hitting their quarterly numbers to the detriment of their companys health. But behavioural economics approach argues that short-term incentives can improve long-term performance. I.e., executives are more likely to put priority on their annual bonuses, which arrive sooner and are more often tied to measures over which they have some control, such as profit and efficient use of capital. 2. Two top asset managers to drop staff bonuses ( Source: FT.com ) Two prominent UK asset managers have decided to stop paying executive bonuses as pressure mounts on the investment industry to rethink rewards top employees. It comes as the industry faces greater scrutiny over remuneration and investment performance. Some experts questioned the logic of removing staff bonuses as it could make it harder for fund companies to control costs in difficult market environments. Higher fixed salaries across the industry could also result in higher fees for investors, according to the head of a boutique fund house. The issue the industry has is that it relies on too-high fees, he said. If everyone adopted Neil Woodfords approach that [would] massively increase fixed costs, which means the industry is even less incentivised to change its fee [structures]. 3. Investment: Rise of the DIY algo traders ( Source: FT.com ) Google: Will tech-savvy amateurs be able to beat the market? Dan Houghton, a London restaurant chain owner by day and algorithmic stock trader by night, stumbled on a company tailor-made for him: Quantopian, an online trading platform and crowdsourced hedge fund. Burrito-Dan is one of a swelling number of mathematicians, programmers, data engineers and physicists taking advantage of cheap, powerful computers and the availability of financial data to code their own trading strategies. Some believe this new wave of amateur algo traders can be harnessed using crowdsourcing techniques to disrupt one of Wall Streets elite professions  the hedge fund manager. While the conventional hedge fund industry grapples with losses, the quant hedge fund industry is on its seventh straight year of client inflows, with total assets going from $407.7bn in 2009 to $878.7bn this year. New platforms like Numerai, Quantopian, Quantiacs and QuantConnect enable a new generation of iconoclasts who will help upturn the traditional hedge fund model. 4. Rural India is eating less than it did 40 years ago ( Source: Scroll.in ) A National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau says 70 years since Independence, rural India, where 833 million Indians (70%) live, people are consuming fewer nutrients than required. On average, compared to 1975-79, a rural Indian now consumes 550 fewer calories and 13 gm protein, 5 mg iron, 250 mg calcium and about 500 mg vitamin A lesser. Lower status of women in South Asia was offered as an explanation. However, despite declining nutrient intake, malnutrition levels in India have decreased. In absolute terms, however, these levels remain among the highest in the world. Malnutrition in India is still 13 times worse than in Brazil, nine times worse than in China and three times worse than in South Africa. Unfortunately, not enough attention is paid to this problem  in 2015, the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, the only source of longitudinal data on nutrition levels and food intake across 10 states of India, was shut. 5. How unwanted second-hand books became big business ( Source: FT.com ) Google: The company that turned its counter-intuitive idea into a multimillion-pound venture Over a decade ago three young men in England, taking a contrary view on second hand books, tried buying such books at car boot sales for pennies and auctioning them on eBay. The results were spectacular. Now, their business World of Books employs more than 500 people in a business park premises in mundane Goring-by-Sea. It buys 70m volumes a year, turns over 30m and made 1.3m profit in 2015, its fourth profitable year. One of the many clever things about World of Books is that it doesnt need to maintain its own retail site. Its system is integrated with all the major customer-facing platforms  when you buy a second-hand book on Amazon, it will often have come from Goring via the ecommerce behemoth. 6. The risky business of hiring stars ( Source: Harvard Business Review ) A Harvard study argues that it is better to grow stars (CEOs, researchers, software developers or leading professionals in investment banking, management consultancy, law or public relations) within the company than hiring. The reasons: 1) The stars performance falls sharply and stays well below old achievement levels thereafter. 2) The groups performance slips due to interpersonal conflicts and a breakdown of communication. 3) The companys valuation suffers as investors perceive the appointments as value-destroying events. The authors discuss how the companies can grow stars. Sanford Bernstein and Lehman Brothers spent inordinate amounts of time and money finding the right talent and grooming it. Others recruit smart people and develop some into stars, knowing that they may lose them to rivals. Only a few corporations recruit bright people, develop them into stars, and do everything possible to retain them. 7. Mafia management ( Source: Economist.com ) A new TV soap making waves, Gomorrah , is a drama about a collection of Italian gangs known as the Camorra that run a criminal empire in Naples. The focus is on drugs, particularly cocaine. However, the most striking thing about Camorra is how good they are at business. It is organised like a corporation, with descending levels of power. Top tier of senior managers determine strategy and allocate resources; a second tier of middle managers purchase and process the product; a third level of sales chiefs co-ordinate distribution; a fourth grade of street salesmen deliver the product to customers. Camorra has also put its own unique spin on standard management techniques. Team-building: New recruits are initiated with quasi-religious ceremonies. Rising stars are given endearing nicknames such as Carlucciello o mangiavatt (little Charles the cat-eater). They take care of the relatives of workers who die on the job. The CSR pays. Locals take the gangsters side during police raids! 8. The sharing economy is dead, And we killed it ( Source: Fastcompany.com ) Collaborative consumption, or 'the sharing economy' took hold around 2010. Amid one of the worst recessions in history, this allowed us to focus on sharing rather than individualistic consumption. A number of startups came up. Ecomodo in 2007; Crowd Rent, Share Some Sugar, and NeighborGoods in 2009; Thingloop, OhSoWe, and SnapGoods in 2010. Today only NeighborGoods is alive. It was a beautiful idea that struck hard, but when it died, nobody seemed to notice. Most of these platforms discovered a incongruity between enthusiasm and actual use. Lyft debuted as a neighbourly version of Uber but now competes on price. Parking Panda once marketed itself as a way to share parking spaces with neighbours but now many of its shared parking spaces are in restaurants, hotels, commercial garages, and airports. Its not that these tools and sites arent good services or that they dont make things easier. Its rather that they have little to do with the original promise of the sharing economy.  9. Indian startups lack the scale and depth to make another silicon valley ( Source: Quartz India ) Three pillars characterize thriving startup ecosystems: breadth, scale, and depth. Breadth - how many sectors the ecosystem spans. Depth - how many players in each sector. Scale  size of the company in each sub-sector. Silicon Valley scores high. How does India stack up? Indian startup space offers breadth across sectors (Mitra Biotech, Freshdesk, Postman, Forus Health, The Viral Fever) but lacks scale. On depth, you can count on the fingers the number of startups in each sector. The lack of depth is partly due to the lack of scale. These structural problems need innovation to address the lack of widespread broadband availability and inadequate access to digital payment platforms, for instance. Government and large corporations will have a major role to play. The success of services such as Reliance Jio, which seeks to roll out a pan-India 4G network, and the unified payments interface will be crucial. The tailwinds are certainly in Indias favour given the many initiatives launched in the past 12 months. 10. Japan vs currency speculators ( Source: Project Syndicate ) Even as Japan struggles with its deflationary torpor, it current travails arise from yens appreciation  24% against major currencies last year. Expansionary policies  a pillar of Abenomics  should contribute to currency depreciation. However, the US Feds dovish approach to exiting its own quantitative-easing program and expansionary policies in other major economies have weakened the impact. Recently, Brexit, along with introduction of negative rates by central banks, including the Bank of Japan (BOJ), shook markets. Taking advantage of this, hedge-fund managers and other speculators have increasingly been betting on the yens appreciation. Government threats of action against exchange-rate movements deemed speculative have remained just that - threats. The author argues that the MOF should instead intervene courageously in currency markets to stem the yens appreciation. Speculators will learn a tough lesson and Japans economy could get back on track.","One of the biggest trends in e-commerce today is the role social media is playing in the industry. Consumers exchange information, recommend and review products and services widely. is an Indian company that wants to capitalize on this trend and facilitate and complete actual transactions on social media. Vipin Aggarwal, campus entrepreneur turned venture capitalist, and Ekta Mittal, formerly with Amazon, launched enMarkit at the end of 2012, a mere year after meeting each other. Through enMarkit, Vipin and Ekta take a technology-enabled approach to addressing the fundamental issues of doing business online in India.The idea is to emulate real world Indian shopping behavior where people seek references about good shops from friends then use their friends name and business with the shopkeeper in order to get better deals.After a purchase, the shopkeeper is eager for more referrals so he offers incentives for repeat shoppers and referred customers. Thats the enMarkit motto Vipin Agarwal, founder of enMarkit, champions.By such as ETSY, Amazon and eBay, with social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, enMarkit has found a way to leverage the advantages of social networking to properly benefit ecommerce for service providers and individual buyers. EnMarkits nifty Pinterest-style website allows vendors to create a Web page for their business, get a dedicated brand page within minutes, and sync up their social networks so that enMarkit can manage their product listings for them. Likewise, buyers can rate and review sellers theyve purchased from and share their experiences among their online network. Since the launch of enMarkit at the end of 2012, they have reached over 7,000 new registered sellers, over one million page views with only a 23% bounce (industry average being 40%), and the month on month growth in number of visitors is over 400%.In addition, 37% of traffic on the enMarkit website comes from referrals. The team has built two enabling solutions, the F.A.S.T. check out system and ONE unified storefront, to help translate this real world social buying behavior to the virtual world of ecommerce. As all vendors know, if something is too hard for customers to figure out, they wont do it. Through enMarkits universal and mobile friendlyFast Anywhere Secure Transactions (F.A.S.T.), buyers can safely purchase services or products that run the gamut from handcrafted gifts to home stays abroad. Then they create a listing that describes their product or service (pictured top of page). Once theyve entered a description, uploaded photos and even videos of their product, a unique, integrated payment link is generated allowing the seller to then share their listing through every online networking outlet they use. The perk here is that there are no setup fees because sellers dont pay enMarkit anything until they actualize their first transaction. Once theyve made their first sale, only Advanced and Professional members pay a first transaction fee. EnMarkit does, however, enforce a 5% transaction commission for each sale, which is used to recover money transfer fees and operating costs, but buyers can use enMarkit at no cost. When buyers click a listing link a clean popup opens with the item description, its price and a Buy It button at the bottom, which takes them to the F.A.S.T. page that collects their payment information. F.A.S.T. makes it easy for buyers and sellers to make online purchases, but the most intriguing part about enMarkit, what sets them apart from all other e-commerce websites, is their ONE storefront, which connects vendors and customers on multiple social platforms. Social media then plays a crucial part in lead generation and indirect marketing for the enMarkit seller because once a shopper has purchased an item, she can write a review for the seller and share her new product and experience with her online network of friends. On the flip side, in order to retain and draw more customers, sellers can offer discounts to loyal patrons who write positive reviews and refer their friends. Can this be the start of crowdsourced marketing? Where social networks function organically as airwaves for consumerism? ONE enables social graph search among the displayed items so that buyers can get information on the sellers who have been ranked by their social networks; they can see whos viewed it, liked it, commented on it, bookmarked it, bought it and reviewed it. Furthermore service providers are ranked on the enMarkit webpage depending on how closely they are connected to each buyer creating a personalized shopping environment for each buyer and seller. Further empowering the buyer is their ability to post a product or service they are looking for on enMarkit and have vendors vie for their business. Vipin and Ekta have created a mash up of ecommerce websites and social networks and added Yelp with a twist. And theyve done so all the way from Gurgaon, India, a small city just north of Delhi. Vipin had spent more than five years investing in, managing, building and exiting multiple business in India, but he was always eager to help entrepreneurs and therefore kept a look out for technology enabled solutions to help launch their businesses. Once Vipin and Ekta were introduced to each other, they discovered a shared interest in social enablement. Whereas Vipin shared the business challenges to be addressed, Ekta brought together solutions through technology. At the end of 2012 Vipin and Ekta left their jobs and started the journey to launch Colabcom Technologies, the holding company that owns the enMarkit brand. And so far enMarkit has already been recognized at multiple forums for its unique innovations on design, simplicity, and usefulness to the online transactional ecosystem. Just to name a few, enMarkit has been shortlisted among the top 4 up and coming ventures from India by the TiE Global Conclave, has been hailed as the fastest growing ecommerce company in India by YourStory, and has been featured on NextBigWhat, Indias largest platform for entrepreneurs and small businesses. Not even a year later. Currently, enMarkit focuses on the Travel and Design verticals within the Indian geography, specifically targeting service providers and service seekers, but in due course, they will broaden the footprint of their offering. When asked about enMarkits future, Vipins ambition is for enMarkit to reach over one million users by this years end.He expects to be operational break even within the next 5-6 months and he expects to be profitable on a Net Profit basis by March 2014. And Vipin wont be resting on his laurels once that goal is reached. The idea is to make enMarkit the one stop destination to provide solutions for all go-to-market and post-launch market building strategies for individuals and businesses.Instead of focusing on service led business models, the aim is to leverage technology to create products that offer higher scalability and better margins. Vipin and Ekta have introduced a universal yet individualized social ecommerce solution that embraces social network marketing unobtrusively for its users. It is a personalized market for buyers and sellers to mingle among their own, their familys and their friends vast online networks.","Direct marketing is only one of the many tools available to your small business today.

The may be the first smartphone available in the U.S. with a true edge-to-edge display. Thats a totally flat screen that extends all the way to the phones edges. Sharp is more known for its high-definition televisions. This is the companys first smartphone product. In an official announcement, Yoshisuke Hasegawa, Executive Managing Officer of Sharp Corporation, : Here is a look at the phone up close: There may be a slight bezel at the edges of the phones edge-to-edge dispplay, according to a from The Next Web. So it will be interesting to see how this display stacks up to future edge-to-edge screens. But what might truly be important, depending on the users needs, is the cost of the phone, some of its features and its visual aesthetics. First, the Sharp AQUOS Crystal will run Android on a 1.2GHz quad-core processor. The phone is sold with 1.5GB of RAM and 8GB of ROM. As weve seen with other budget-friendly smartphones and tablets, that amount of memory is fairly standard. There is an expansion slot to add another 128GB of flash memory, too. The 5 inch edge to edge display is HD. Another feature unique to the Sharp AQUOS Crystal is what the company calls Clip Now. This is essentially a social sharing app that creates a tiny URL for the image you capture on your screen. That could include any site youre browsing or images you collect with the 8-megapixel rear-mounted camera. The feature will make it even easier to share and display images online. Theres also a 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera for video chats. The camera features a Night Catch feature for capturing images in low light. The phone will sell for about $150 when it is officially released at the retail level in white and black. This smartphone will only be available on the Sprint network and its subsidiaries. If its purchased through a Sprint calling plan, Sprint will charge customers $10 a month for the phone over two years, bumping the cost to $240 over time. The phone is available for outright purchase and can be used on the Virgin Mobile (only available in black) or Boost Mobile (sold in white) pre-paid networks.","Retail trends can come in the strangest forms. But no matter where they happen in the world, the smartest entrepreneurs know how to spot them, promote them and turn them into a viable business. The facekini, a cover for the face and head made from wetsuit material, may look strange to people in most parts of the world. But in Qingdao, China, its a growing trend. Residents of this area arent interested in the tanned skin that normally goes along with a day at the beach. And so they use facekinis to keep their faces and necks covered up while swimming or doing other beach activities. The strange looking head gear can also (supposedly) deter creatures like jellyfish, mosquitoes and even sharks. Retired middle-aged Qingdaonese women are the primary wearers of these interesting looking headpieces. These women especially value a pale complexion and will apparently go to great lengths to prevent skin tanning and the sun damage that goes along with it. Beachgoer Wang Xiuzhi Chinese publication Xinhua: Retailers along the beaches of Qingdao and online have taken advantage of the trend. Facekinis are available in various colors and patterns. Some are even sold with coordinating full-body wetsuits. Social media users have taken notice of the facekini trend thanks to its unusual appearance. And even fashion magazines have incorporated them into photo shoots. Clearly, its something you dont see every day in other parts of the world. But while not necessarily the most attractive accessories, they do serve a purpose. Originally, facekini inventor Zhang Shifan actually intended the product to protect wearers from offshore sea crabs. But when people realized that they can protect from the sun better than SPF or shade, facekinis really took off. The facekinis practical application is what got the product its first customers. But the unconventional appearance and all the attention that came along with it has likely played at least a marginal role in helping it grow.","How well can you utilize Facebook Ads as a part of your online marketing? Answering this question is probably an extremely difficult task. However, I have tried to simplify it by formulating two alternatives: Before you start using Facebook Ads, you need to when and whom you should target. Moreover, understanding what campaigns to run at different stages of the sales funnel is equally important. If you ask me, I do not just want to run an ad. I want to build a plan that I can implement on an ongoing basis. To make it easier for you, I have decided to show you the top five ways you can effectively run Facebook Ads at different stages, to target different audiences. Are you ready for it? If you want to see who your recent visitors are, you can ensure this through the Page Like Ad. Simply insert a code snippet called Custom Audience Pixel into your website to create a  . You can view your consumers who had visited your site on the next day, or can keep them in your audiences list for as long as 180 days. You can install Website Custom Audience on all the pages of your site or at least on more than one specific page. This type of ad targets any demographic statistics, irrespective of age, gender, or location. Make sure you consider using clear messages and calls-to-action, as ad-text is limited to 90 characters. Page Like Ad also targets people who have previously signed up for your email list. All you need to do is create a Custom Audience and transfer the email list to Facebook. These records are then matched with Facebook users and an audience group for your ads is created. However, the match is only successful when the email address the person used to sign up for your email list is the same as the one that they use for Facebook. Once you have gathered a good number of new fans, you can start creating the next type of ad. No customers will want to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what your business is all about. Your marketing funnel should be interesting to entice your customers. Building a squeeze page (a page whose call-to-action is an opt-in form) with a signature giveaway is a great way to inspire Facebook users to join your email list. Giveaway products and services, which not only relate to your business but also appeal to your target audiences, are perfect. Moreover, running a promotion or contest can encourage participants to register their email address to your site. Your fans are probably the best audiences you can have on Facebook and once you achieve a good number of them, you can easily expect a better conversion rate. But what if the audiences do not find your products and services interesting? For this you need to create an effective landing page that interests them enough to visit, like, and share with others. Moreover, the page should include all the business information, such as address, phone number, email address and creative images to draw their attention. Facebook can now test a feature called  to target people similar to your existing audiences. Facebook uses the information that you upload for Custom Audiences to create lists of other people with similar profiles. It also uses elementary demographic data to create the Lookalike profiles. Thus, this social media platform is able to accumulate data on a group of audiences that closely resembles the individuals who are already your customers. This new targeting tool not only allows you to sell products and services to a certain group of people based on how they look, but also ensures that you can reach out to potential customers who share similar characteristics with the current ones. This targeting technique drives a wide range of success metrics, including larger purchase size or increased return on investment. Your fans are the best people tohelp you sell your product. Use your ads to offer them incentives such as coupons and discounts, and encourage them to like your product page. You can also advertise for surveys, quizzes and other engaging content to generate interest and drive traffic to your product page. Invite people to share your page with their friends to grow the community. Additionally, you can target your email subscribers. After all, this is one of the most qualified leads you can have in your business and website visitors who visit specific product pages within your site. Running an ad by targeting this group can actually work great as a follow up. Facebook ads are a great tool to boost your content. Promote the content through three options: This is the best Facebook ad tool to promote your content directly in a users where they usually focus their attention. Promoted posts help your content reach more of your fans and their friends. Facebook automatically sets the promotion posts to run for three days. These ads appear in the sidebar of Facebook and allow you to aim at hyper-segmented markets that are not connected to your Facebook page. These appear in the News Feed just like the Promoted Posts. But the only difference is that you can promote your content to users who are not your fans or friends fans. This gives you the ability to reach a wider market. Facebook ads can be effectively run at different stages of your online business and target different audiences. Such ads can sell your products, promote your posts, target the right audiences and turn your followers into email subscribers. Be sure to use Page like ads to target people who have previously signed up for your email list.","MUMBAI: The proposed Rs 98,000-crore along with the that seeks to build 6,000 km of high-speed rail network, can create a whopping USD 51 billion business opportunity for the MSME sector, says a report. If the government makes 30 per cent mandatory sourcing from Micro Small and Medium Enterprises for these projects, it can create a USD 51 billion window of opportunities for the sector, according to the report by domestic agency . A whopping USD 168 billion will be spent over the next 10 years, if the projects go as planned, it said, adding that they can change the face of in terms of technology absorption and innovation, apart from creating a large channel of funding opportunities for them. Collectively 28 per cent MSMEs in the special purpose machineries, fabricated metals and printing among other sectors will gain from these mega projects, provided the government makes it mandatory to source 30 per cent of inputs from them through an offset clause. If so, this can unleash nearly USD 51 billion for the sector. Citing the MSME ministry's assessment, the report said that such an offset clause will see over 24 per cent of the fabricated metal producers gaining, while for non-metallic producers (12.5 per cent), special purpose machinery makers (12.1 per cent), textile companies (8.9 per cent) and close to 8 per cent structural metal producers gaining. This will be achievable provided the projects involves manufacturing MSMEs in the project,which can create immense value for the sector in terms of aiding the gross capital formation (GCF), an important indicator of the extra value created over existing fixed assets, says the report, adding currently, the for the MSME segment is only USD 52 billion. These projects can help MSMEs gain an additional 3.7 per cent of their annual manufacturing GCF due to the cheap additional debt made available through the projects. In terms of fund needs, the bullet train network can potentially add 1.5 per cent to MSMEs' debt shortfall over the next 10 years, the report said, adding despite this there will still be an additional debt gap of USD 19 billion for them. While many analysts have questioned the viability of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, the report estimated that at USD 1,600 per capita income, the country is better placed than Japan which rolled out its first Shinkansen (bullet train) in 1964 between Tokyo and Osaka, when its per capita income was only USD 1,346. Japan has agreed to fund USD 12 billion to the project at 1 per cent interest for a 30-year tenor.","At Ambit we spend a lot of time reading articles that are not      directly relevant to Indian stocks. However, since the Indian economy is      now umbilically linked to its global counterparts, the articles  that    we  come across have relevance for Indian stocks and the Indian    economy.  In  that context, this report contains the ten most    interesting pieces  that  we read this week. Here are the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week, ended September 30, 2016. 1) The return of Bollywoods unconventional hero [ Source: LiveMint ] This piece highlights how our audiences have evolved over the last couple of decades which has led to unconventional actors bagging lead roles and enjoying stardom. Such an evolution has happened on the back of audiences wanting to see characters who looked and behaved like them, people who lived in commonplace Indian settings rather than in fancy houses abroad. As per the article, this transformation is a result of a) multiplex explosion in India that allows for smaller theatres and niche audience b) new breed of directors coming in from various parts of India to tell their stories and c) longevity enjoyed by content-driven high-concept films that have a shelf life far beyond the films made primarily for money. 2) Banks face $5bn hit to research teams as asset managers cut spending [ Source: Financial Times ] As per this piece, asset managers intend to cut their analyst research budgets by 30 per cent, heaping more pain on the investment banking industry that has already been forced to make thousands of people redundant on the back of falling profitability. The sharp reduction in how much fund houses are willing to pay for research will be felt most strongly in Europe, where asset managers plan to halve how much they spend on sell side research. The cuts to research budgets, which are estimated to be worth $15bn a year, will trigger further job cuts for analysts and the potential elimination of entire research divisions. 3) Driverless cars and MITs test of the crowdsourcing morality [ Source: Financial Times ] Anjana Ahuja in this piece talks about the Moral Machine  a public experiment being run by MIT  which looks at whether aggregating public opinions on ethical dilemmas is an effective way to endow intelligent machines, such as driverless cars, with limited moral reasoning capacity. She argues that given the diverse opinions of people it would be extremely difficult to reach a consensus on the ethics of driverless cars. 4) German consumers hit the sweet spot [ Source: Financial Times ] Germans have a well-earned reputation for thrift, but in the past year they have turned into uncharacteristically big spenders thanks to a combination of record high employment, rising wages, low inflation and near-zero interest rates. Private consumption is growing at about 2 per cent  a rate Germany has not seen since the dotcom boom of the late 1990s. Germanys earlier model of relying on exports has also started changing. The slowdown in emerging markets has tamed demand for German exports. As a result, companies are investing less but German domestic demand is kicking in and taking up the slack, creating a more balanced economy. 5) How Kickstarter became one of the biggest powers in publishing crowdfunding [ Source: The Guardian ] Kickstarter - a platform that puts people who want to produce books in touch with others all over the world who want to support their projects - has an impressive tally of books published. At 2,967 literary projects it features among publishings Big Four: Penguin Random House, Harper Collins, Hachette and Simon & Schuster. In 2015, pledges totalled $35.2m and already in 2016 more than $20m has been pledged for more than 1,500 projects. The article showcases how this platform has been ideal place for projects that aimed to bring forward the ideas that ignited the imaginations of a community, creators providing greater access to their creative process, and voices that are often underrepresented among the most commercial success stories. Literary journals raised more than $200,000 on Kickstarter in 2015, while poetry received almost $300,000. Anthologies brought in almost $500,000, while art books picked up more than $4m. 6) What goes wrong in the brain chemistry of a gambling addict [ Source: nautil.us ] This piece uses the case study of a compulsive gambler at slot machines to study the reasons why we humans tend to get addicted to certain activities with skewed risk-reward profiles which are not in our favor  like gambling. It touches upon the research of B. F. Skinner, who laid out the fundamental principles of learning through reward and punishment in the mid-20th century. His research found that we humans like animals tend to push more as rewards profile becomes random. Gambling addiction rests on intermittent reinforcement alonethe experience of risk, the fact that there will be either loss or gain, creates excitement and the more unpredictable the outcome, the more compelling it becomes. This is another reason why compulsive gamblers continue whether they win or losethe high is in expecting an outcome, desiring that outcome, imagining it, not in its fulfillment. 7) How important is a companys patriarch? [ Source: horizonlinetics.com ] This piece touches upon an important point missed by many investors around the world  the role of patriarch of a company. He use the case of American automobile industry and highlights how the companies in this group have probably have one of the lowest survivability ratios of any industry one can imagine, which probably explains why there isnt an automobile ETF right now. In searching for a common denominator in the failure of so many of these companies that had previously enjoyed periods of success, the common element that emerges is the demise of the patriarch. 8) Wells Fargo reaches the end of its journey [ Source: Financial Times ] Wells Fargos homely and customer centric reputation has been tarnished by the revelation that its winning ways with customers owed as much to the intense pressure it placed on employees to hawk products as to its friendly culture. Managers pressed stores (Wells Fargos term for branches) to hit daily targets, leading to the faking of as many as 2m accounts. It has since dismissed 5,300 miscreant staff and been fined $185m. The article describes how cross selling became the route to profitability the bank: its retail customers now have an average of more than six products and it gains almost as much revenue from fees and commissions as from interest on loans. 9) What NASA could teach Tesla about Autopilots limits [ Source: Scientific American ] Ever since the recent incident involving Teslas Model S which led to driver Joshua Browns death (when the cars Autopilot system failed to recognize a tractor-trailer turning in front of the vehicle) came to light, the public has been debating where the fault lies: with the driver, the company or the automation technology itself. This piece describes how NASAs experience with autopilot can serve some important lessons for the automobile company. 10) The free time paradox in America [ Source: The Atlantic ] In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes forecasted a future that would be governed by a different set of expectations than today. The 21st centurys work week would last just 15 hours, he said, and the chief social challenge of the future would be the difficulty of managing leisure and abundance. The rich were meant to have the most leisure time. The working poor were meant to have the least. But 60 years later, it seems more true to say that it is not leisure that defines the lives of so many rich Americans. It is work. The article describes three reasons why the elites are working more whereas the unemployed poor are enjoying leisure time. - Saurabh Mukherjea is CEO  (Institutional Equities) and Prashant    Mittal is Analyst (Strategy and  Derivatives) at Ambit Capital Pvt Ltd.

Thats what photographer Olesha Haskett-Basma did when she abandoned wedding photography. Heresmore of her story in this weeks Small Business Spotlight. Boudoir and portrait photographs. Yep, you heard us right. Haskett-Basma was on a safe and secure path to success, it seemed, when she launched seven years ago. She booked her very first wedding gig the same month she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Shepherd University. But eventually, she would feel creatively unsatisfied. As a result she decided to take her career and business in a moreerintimate direction. Haskett-Basmas photos are very tasteful. But clearly the market she was aiming at now is less established and ultimately more risky. Leaving wedding photography behind. It probably goes without saying that the biggest risk Haskett-Basma took in her business was leaving the safety of wedding photography behind. Though she admits it was lucrative, she also admits her heart was no longer in it. Leaving wedding photography proved to be an extreme risk and it turned out there was plenty of reason to be concerned. But ultimately, Haskett-Basma believes the decision has made her better at her craftand perhaps a more effective marketer too. She recalls: Personality and rapport. Perhaps the thing that has changed the least about Haskett-Basmas business is the thing that has ultimately made her succession. She explains: 39th Assembly for the Links, Inc. Among her greatest wins, Haskett-Basma lists being asked to photograph the recently, an international non-profit organization for professional women of color. The assignment came about after a photographer Haskett-Basma had worked with years ago became unavailable to do the event. The other photographer remembered Haskett-Basma for her winning personality and asked her to sit in. The event became not only a plumb assignment but a great opportunity to network. Start with her first love. Despite the risks and the rough patch she went through, the one thing Haskett-Basma insists she would change if she had it to do all over again, is to start with what she loves. That would have meant starting in the portrait and boudoir niche and bypassing the wedding photography business completely. The reason, says Haskett-Basma, is simple. While she insists that weddings are, in some ways, not only more lucrative but also easier, she also believes the work she does now plays more to her strengths.

It was a well received book and contained a lot of brand building processes and tips that any business owner can use. But it was a book that featured big brands and you would have to do some extrapolationto take some of those strategies and apply them to your small business. As the book begins, Joseph shares his inspiration for this follow up book. He talks about how he was writing his first book when the economy exploded and people started losing jobs left and right. He talked about how the big paychecks and bonuses disappeared and how this new economy brought to light the myriad small businesses out there that were springing up as newly freed up entrepreneurs launched new businesses. This is what inspired him to write . In this book, he aims to more directly give small businesses tools and tricks of the branding trade that the big boys use to build brands and make it easier for small businesses to apply at budgets that they can afford. Jim Joseph has specialized in award winning branding and marketing strategies for over twenty five years. Hes built some very well known customer brands and marketing agencies along the way such as Kraft, Nestle, Cadillac, Tylenol, and any more. He is currently the President and partner at Lippe Taylor, an agency dedicated to marketing with women across all categories including beauty, fashion, shopping, food, home, wellness and healthcare. Since were talking about experiences, I guess Ill give you my experience of . Im both a marketer and a small business, so when I received my review copy and started reading it  thats how I looked at it. I figured this was Jims product and Im going to experience it. The first thing I noticed is that I had received an autographed copy  Thats nice I thought. The inscription used my name (so I know it wasnt mass autographed) and it was sort of fun. It said Whats your experience? Hmm. Maybe thats what inspired this paragraph. Theres that subliminal advertising at work again. Now, I had read his first book, and thought it was very good  but I didnt end up reviewing it the first time. Maybe that was because I felt that it shared a lot of marketing and branding strategy for big brands and not enough meat for small business. So, Im really happy that I have the opportunity to share whats inside with you. The tone of the writing is fun and friendly. Jim seems to be a smart and likeable guy. When you read any of the chapters, its very much like being in a conversation with Jim. I like that. What I think that YOU will appreciate (especially if youre not a marketing genius) is that hes made the branding lessons more practical and used more small business examples. Here is just one example from the begining of the book: As I read through this version of the book, I have to say that there is not much difference from the original. There are still many references to BIG brands. This is what Joseph knows and understands and these big brands have lots to teach us. In fact, one benefit I can see by using all these big brand references is that all of us knows exactly what hes talking about. We all know and understand and have a shared experience around Coke or the NFL. So Josephs tutorials on dissecting a message or analyzing the competition are much more easily understood when hes referring to a big brand that you know rather than a mom and pop youve never heard of. But if youre the kind of person who doesnt like or appreciate big brand references or stories because you feel that your business isnt like that  then you will find this book frustrating. I wanted to call this section cool tools or templates  but thats really not what they are. Joseph has peppered this book with some of his insider tips and outlines and charts for getting to the heart of a brand. My favorite one is called, For-Who-Is-That-Because-So-Why. Heres how that works. Just write these words down in a column like this: : (enter your target market  demographically) : (enter your target market psychographically) : (Type of business) : (Rational benefit) : (proof points  no more than three) : (Emotional benefit) : (Tagline) The best way to explain this is to give you one that he completed using the dry cleaner I mentioned earlier:  Our beloved neighbors of Chelsea, NY  Are the best dressed folks in town Dry Cleaner  Your safe haven for all your dry cleaning needs  Takes good care of you and your clothes  Special laundry process and a commitment to care  You can do more important things in our life  Neighbors taking care of neighbors If you liked that  then youll find several more worksheets, tips or templates that you can fill out just like that. The really great thing about these is that you can use any market research youve collected already or you will get ideas for what kind of research to do with your market or customer so that you can get to the core of your brand. Overall, I would recommend . If youve already got the first , then Im not sure you need to get this version. But if youre a small business owner, entrepreneur or marketer  then this is the version to grab. While you do that, Im going to play around with that For-Who-Is-That-Because-So-Why  template!"
