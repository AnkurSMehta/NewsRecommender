Banks and tech firms apply blockchain to trade finance,"  LONDON/HONG KONG An HSBC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch venture and financial technology firm R3 said separately on Wednesday that they had created ways of using blockchain technology to simplify trade finance processes. The two banks said they had joined with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore to emulate a letter of credit (LOC) transaction. Letters of credit are one of the most widely used ways to reduce risk between importers and exporters, helping guarantee more than $2 trillion worth of transactions, but the process creates a large paper trail and is time consuming. Meanwhile, R3 said more than 15 of its consortium member banks have also designed self-executing transaction agreements, known as smart contracts, on R3s distributed ledger platform to process accounts receivable purchase transactions, known as invoice financing or factoring, and LOC transactions.  By putting the transaction on a distributed ledger, the importer and its bank, together with the exporter and its own bank, can see the data in real time. Financial services companies around the world have been focusing on developing blockchain technology, with advocates saying it has the potential to save billions of dollars in costs and speed up transaction times. The technology, which underpins the digital currency bitcoin, creates a shared database in which participants can trace every transaction.  Discussions are underway with other banks, corporate clients and shipping companies to further develop the technology, which is in its early stages, said Vivek Ramachandran, global head of product for HSBC's trade finance business.

"Michael Phelps has the perfect body for swimming, but that's not the only reason he's so good","Adam Pretty/Getty Images Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian ever, and his medal count at the Rio Olympics has continued to climb. The swimmer has long been the modern Olympian with the most individual records. Now, he's even coming up against records set 2,168 years ago. As of August 10, Phelps had tied the ancient record set by Leonidas of Rhodes for the most individual wins (12). And he still has a couple more events to go. So what makes Phelps such an incredible swimmer? Many have pointed out that he has a perfect physique for swimming, and they're not wrong: Skye Gould/Tech Insider In sports in general, there has been a sort of a ""size sort"" over recent decades, where athletes have started to focus on sports that they have an ideal body type for, Dr. Michael Joyner , a physician and Mayo Clinic researcher who is one of the world's top experts on fitness and human performance, told Business Insider. Interestingly, said Joyner, elite performers in certain sports tend to be about the same size, as you can see if you look at rowers, gymnasts, and of course, swimmers. Phelps certainly fits the bill . But there has also been unproven speculation out there that Phelps has extreme qualities that make him such a good swimmer, such as the myth that he has double the lung capacity of the average human. (There's no actual evidence for this, and Dr. H. Richard Weiner, a swimmer and former team physician who practiced sports medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, previously told Scientific American that some of the claims about Phelps border on the ridiculous.) While Phelps is certainly built for swimming, most of his competitors are too. They're tall, strong, long-armed, and frequently have longer-than-average torsos and relatively shorter legs. As "" The Sports Gene "" author David Epstein pointed out in a TED talk, even star water polo players share physiology that's different from the average person. But it takes more than just build to get to where Phelps is. As Weiner explained to Scientific American, physical advantages aren't sufficient on their own. You also have to have talent and technique, like Phelps' excellent stroke mechanics. If you've watched Phelps during the Rio Olympics, you'll see that he has intense focus, drive, and a competitive nature too. All of those seem to be pretty important characteristics of a top Olympian. It's the combination of all these factors that makes Phelps such an amazing athlete. Yes, his body is partly responsible, but that's not all.

There's nothing better than financial crisis hindsight and earlier this month we got a big doseof it in the form of a 218-page paper by Laurence Ball ,Department of Economics Chair at Johns Hopkins. In the paper, Ball makes the case that  contrary to statements by some policymakers Lehman Brothers could have been rescued back in 2008 andthe U.S. made a massive mistake in choosing notto do so. The paper, four years in the works, is unusual not just for the forcefulness of its argument Ball calculates that Lehman had $131 billion worth of securities that would have been eligible to secure Federal Reserve loans and thereby keep the bank in business but also inits methodology. Ball draws upon materials from the Lehman Brothers bankruptcyexaminers' report, the U.S. government's financial crisis commission inquiry, news clippings, books and the like to help draw hisconclusions. We talk to Ball about the genesis of the paper and what it means for markets today. SoundCloud: 38: The Fed Made a Massive Mistake Letting Lehman Go by Bloomberg ",

There arehirings at Credit Suisse Group AG, on the Trump campaign, and inpost-Brexit Britain, but the real attention is on the labor-market subtext of the FOMC minutes to be released this afternoon. Anticipation is building for the July minutes of the Federal Open MarketCommittee meeting, with hawkish comments from New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley on Tuesday helping the dollar snap itslosing streak . He said a September rate hike is still possible  even if markets aren't convinced that it's probable sendingthe futures-implied oddsof a rate hike in 2016 above50 percent for the first time since the aftermath of the U.K. referendum. Even so, whilemarkets do their best to parse inputs into Fed decision-making, the ground is shifting beneath their feet with ever more big names throwing shade at the efficacy of monetary-policy levers. See Paul Krugman tackle the subject in our most recentepisode of What'd You Miss. Money managers aren't respecting the August lull, with changes afoot at a swath of different funds. While Credit Suisse is hiring , Paul Tudor Jones is said to be firing , after investors withdrew close to $2 billion from Tudor Investment Corp. this year. His is not the only hedge fund experiencing woesnew data from Eurekahedge showed investors pulled $5.7 billion across the industry in July, although this interesting paperdebunks the prevailing narrative on lacklusterhedge-fund returns. It's not confined tofunds: Cisco Systems Inc. is also said to be cutting 14,000 jobs . Turning a more macro lens onto labor markets, data in the U.K. showed jobless claims unexpectedly declined . Oil prices slid after weekly data highlighted expanding U.S. gasoline stockpiles , renewing concerns of a global oil glut, with Brent futures down by as much as1.2 percent by 5:47 a.m. in New York. Comments from Saudi Arabia last week that it wasprepared to stabilize markets had helped to putcrude prices on a winning tear after they'd entereda bear market in late July. The renewed uncertaintyin crude prices in recent months has slammed the brakes on asset sales in both Kazakhstan and Russia , which is delaying what would have been its biggest suchdealin a decade, a $5 billion stake in Bashneft PJSC. China's bid to open its financial borders for foreign investors took another step forward after analysts said a program to allow market participants in Hong Kong to trade stocks on the mainland Shenzhen exchange would boost its chances of getting domestic equities included in MSCI Inc.'s main benchmarks.

Omnichannel done right: 4 ways to keep the communication in marketingcommunications,"This sponsored post is produced in association with Ytel. Consumers have thoroughly embraced the brave new world of modern communication and always-on connectivity  and theyve also come to expect that. And if youre a smart marketer, youre going to follow them into that increasingly well-settled frontier to keep your competitive edge with an omnichannel approach supported by cloud communications. But youre not alone. A study by Neustar found that 40 percent of companies believe that omnichannel marketing is important  and 30 percent believe these strategies are critical. 35 percent are already out there with their message broadcasting throughout a customers digital life, with 27 percent making plans to get there soon. The VentureBeat Insight report, Omnichannel Trends: Data, platforms, mobile, and commerce , found that 34 percent of marketers are upping their game by appealing to two to three channels, while 7 percent juggle an extraordinary 1020 platforms in their effort to corner of their targets attention. Its a hell of a crowd, and you need to earn your place in it. If you dont offer incredibly relevant messages that really mean something to your customer, theyre going to dismiss your company as irrelevant, too. But theres a major drawback when marketers take the leap without a strategy  the VentureBeat report also found that 39 percent of marketers feel pressured to use more engagement platforms than they can comfortably manage, and thats when focused, relevant communication starts to break down. And your customer will always notice. The problem? Your customers do not think, live, or shop in channels. No matter the touchpoint, the channel, or the device they use, a customer is still just one person, and you need to learn how to treat them that way. The answer isnt adding more channels  its understanding and managing the channels your customers are in, in extraordinary ways. Its understanding the power of communication on a granular level, and recognizing that the foundation of your business, from initial sale to eternal loyalty, boils down to basic human interaction. Offer the products and services your customers want, but also know what they need. This comes from a deep, intrinsic knowledge of the industry you operate in, so you understand your customers pain points, and know exactly how to soothe them. While on its surface omnichannel communication benefits the marketer  all those ways to get your message across, theres no way your customer can miss them!its really about giving customers a choice about where and when and how they want to communicate with you. Your customers notice when theyre getting the information they need, in the place where they want to be. More importantly, they notice when you dont  and thats the kind of service that sends previously loyal customers fleeing. So that means actively listening and engaging with your customers, prospects, and leads, which directly impacts your bottom line  because according to a report from Walker , by 2020, customer experience will overtake price and product as the key brand differentiator. How do you connect, listen and learn? Here are some of the channels where you need to be hanging on to your customers every word. 60 percent of marketers are still using social channels as a marketing tool , rather than a driver of customer experience, and thats why theyre leaving money on the table. The numbers dont lie: A study from Bain found that when companies engage and respond to customer service requests over social media, those customers spend 20 percent to 40 percent more with the company  and theyre almost three times more likely to recommend a brand, says HBR . And if you arent responsive on social media, youre going to see your churn rate increase by up to 15 percent . So change your focus from broadcasting to listening, and engage with your customers on the issues and interests that matter to them. Dashboards like Hootsuite can help you monitor mentions of your brand across all your social media profiles and stay on top of conversations and comments. Dimensional Research found that 88 percent of customers are influenced by online customer service reviews when making buying decisions, so you need to stay on top of your online mentions. Set up Google Alerts with your company and product names to keep track, and keep tabs on the places where your customers are most likely to talkfrom consumer review sites like Yelp, Insider Pages, and Angies list to directory services like Yahoo Local, Google Places, and Citysearch. Responding to reviews helps make customers feel heardand offering assistance to resolve any issues develops tremendous goodwill. Being open to direct customer contact, where and how they want to reach you, is one of the most important ways to establish authentic engagement and productive two-way conversations. Make contact links prominent across your site and on all of your social media profiles, as well as add a way for customers to contact you from an email or push notification. You can also consider soliciting opinions via customer surveys and polls. Request feedback directly in notifications, and even use the Facebooks Questions feature to pick your users brains. Customers choose communication channels based on what they need to accomplish, so all avenues of contact need to be easy for consumers to find, be reliable, and be easy to use. More traditional communications channels, which include phone, email, and chat, offer a level of comfort for the customer and simpler access to your company. eDigitals Customer Service Benchmark found that live chat is a particularly popular avenue for customers, because it provides near-instant response times, clear answers, and an easy way to ask further questions or for clarification. But the phone is both the most traditional communication platform of them all, and the most neglected. Nonverbal cues such as tone variations and pauses offer essential conversational clues to enrich the experience. And there really isnt much that can beat that feeling of direct, one-to-one focused connection that makes a customer feel truly heard. Active listening packs a huge punch for your business. Youre taking all the noise of marketing and sales and turning it into a real connection with your customers  the fundamental building block of sales and long-term loyalty. Its omnichannel done right.

STOCKS FALL: Here's what you need to know,"Flickr/JasonLangheine Happy Leap Day! Stocks fell on the final day of February, the 29th day of the month which only comes around once every four years. For the month, the major US averages finished just about flat but slightly in the red. First, the scoreboard: Dow: 16,511.1, -128.9, (-0.8%) S&P 500: 1,932, -16, (-0.8%) Nasdaq: 4,557.9, -32.5, (-0.7%) WTI crude oil: $33.80, +3% Economy We got three pieces of economic data out Monday morning and they were all disappointing. (Well, there were four, with the ISM Milwaukee reading hitting 55.22 against expectations for 50.00. As niche regional economic indicators go this is very niche and very regional.) The latest Chicago PMI report indicated contraction in manufacturing activity in the Midwest during February, with the reading hitting 47.6, down from 55.6 the prior month and below expectations for a reading of 52.5. ""If one looks beyond the gyrations seen over the past three months then trend activity has been running a little below the 50 neutral mark, highlighting continued sluggish activity levels, with manufacturers under particular pressure,"" said Phillip Uglow, chief economist of MNI indicators, in the release . Also out Monday was Dallas Fed's manufacturing activity index , which hit -31.8, better than the -34.6 report in January but still worse than expected. This report has been among the worst pieces of economic data out over the last year or so as Texas and the greater south central US has been the epicenter of the fracking boom and subsequent crash (only North Dakota, really, has been hit harder). Among the disappointing comments out of the Dallas Fed's survey were comments from a chemical manufacturing executive who said they didn't know, ""if it is the weather, uncertainty created by the presidential election, or just a slowdown in the world economy, but  things are definitely slowing down."" Another executive in the fabricated metal manufacturing industry said, ""Our backlog has declined (50 percent less than the same time last year). We are receiving a very high volume of requests for proposals, but either are not winning them or the projects are on hold. Pricing to obtain any work has decreased for the benefit of the owner/contractor."" Finally, a disappointing report on the housing market crossed as the January report on pending home sales showed a 2.5% decline in January compared to the prior month, the biggest monthly decline in two years. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said, "" While January's blizzard possibly caused some of the pullback in the Northeast, the recent acceleration in home prices and minimal inventory throughout the country appears to be the primary obstacle holding back would-be buyers."" Recession Watch, 2016 Commentary out of US Treasury specialists at Kessler Investment Advisors over the weekend offered the argument that the recent uptick in inflation we've seen over the last couple months is a sign that the economic cycle has already turned and that perhaps we are in recession now. It's worth keeping in mind that recessions aren't declared by the NBER until after the fact - so, for example the Great Recession was called in December 2008 when the economy had obviously been in the tank for months before that - and so we won't really know we're in recession until, I guess, it's too late or whatever. But here's Kessler on the thinking here: Counter-intuitively, the recent increases in core inflation are normal in the sequence of how a recession evolves . The typical business-cycle sequence is that the manufacturing sector weakens first, then employment and consumer spending, and lastly, inflation. In fact, it is often not until the recession is over that inflation begins to come down. Inflation is the longest lagging indicator. Now, some folks on Twitter noted that with this call we've got US Treasury specialists basically recommending investors go long Treasurys. This is a fair point. But it's a view. Elsewhere, Bob Bryan breaks down the two views that markets and the economy are outlining for investors to digest about just what is going on in the US right now. Basically you've got markets saying that things are bad while data says that while things might not be great, they are probably not that bad, either. Barclays' Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients that, ""In particular, US data will need to firm enough to substantially reduce fears that the economy is on the brink of recession ... We stand by our original thesis: something's got to give. The longer financial market uncertainty persists, the more likely it is that the give will come from activity."" And so this is basically the idea that perceived weakness in the economy displayed in financial markets but not explicitly clear in the data will create the data that makes this perceived weakness actual. Reflexivity, or something. Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia was the largest exporter of oil to China in January , leapfrogging Russia after falling behind them in the prior month. But, there's a catch. Here's Barclays: Russia ESPO blend has been popular among Chinese teapot refineries, which received crude import quotas and started importing crude oil last year. However, according to [research firm] Argus, teapot refineries are facing credit constraints from banks. At least two ESPO cargos were defaulted by Chinese teapot refineries due to credit issues. So! It's a China credit story as much as anything else. Which is interesting and also slightly concerning. Of course, the important thing to Saudi Arabia is that they continue exporting oil and maintaining its dominant position as an exporter in the global oil markets. The concern for markets concerned about things like China is, well, credit conditions in China. Russia, like Saudi Arabia, wants to export lots of stuff, too. Elsewhere in the House of Saud, Will Martin notes that the decline foreign exchange reserve in Saudi Arabia dropped to their lowest level in three years in January, indicating another area of financial stress in the kingdom. Here's HSBC on the problem (emphasis ours): The government has continued to drawdown on its savings to cover budget shortfalls, with oil prices averaging USD/bbl 35 in January. Lower oil receipts have also been reflected in tighter domestic liquidity. Commercial bank deposits have contracted m-o-m in four of the last six months, helping - along with a recent pick-up in credit - to push the loan-to-deposit ratio to its highest reading since 2009. Twitter Fred Wilson likes Twitter and Saturday's NBA game of the year between the Golden State Warriors and Oklahoma City Thunder is a prime example of why. (The short of it is that Stephen Curry, the best player in the NBA right now, had a historic night that was capped off with one of the most outrageous shots you'll see. Even if you don't like basketball,  watch this video .) Wilson writes (emphasis ours): Steph's opponents expressed their appreciation for what he is doing on Twitter in the moment. Not on Facebook. Not on Instagram. Not on Snapchat. Not anywhere else. And you don't have to be on Twitter to see that. You can see that here and many other places. Here's the thing about Twitter. You don't need to be logged into Twitter to see these tweets. You can see them on Twitter logged out. Or you can see them embedded in other places on web and mobile or on TV and elsewhere. You only need to be logged into Twitter to tweet. So anyone who is focusing on the logged in monthly active user number is missing something bigger. Wilson also notes that Donald Trump is using Twitter as his primary - and really, only - media tool to communicate with voters and storm through the Republican primaries. And look, we're journalists here at Business Insider and as members of the media really, really like Twitter. But the reality is that investors simply don't like to see companies that aren't growing. And while revenue growth at Twitter is still strong its user growth has been flat. But this metric is what Wilson is taking issue with. And it's a good argument. Twitter is the kind of thing that people who don't use it all the time don't understand, or are intimidated by. But when you use Twitter a lot you realize it is the most powerful and amazing network of just raw information you could ever have hoped to stumble upon. Growth is important, but Twitter's coming of age might be among growing the value of its users rather than the number of its users, and this is both scary and uncertain because really, no company that is, at heart, a software company has made a successful shift at this scale in the Tech Bubble 2.0 era. So we'll see. Additionally Ben Carlson on Jack Bogle vs. university endowments . Emanuel Derman on Bloomberg Radio . It was a no good , terrible day for Valeant Pharmaceuticals.

A dummy's guide to GST,"he long-delayed Goods and Services Tax Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. Now a battle awaits its passage in the Rajya Sabha where the ruling National Democratic Alliance is in a minority. The Bill was taken up for consideration in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley appealed to all parties to rise above partisan considerations to support it but its fate in Rajya Sabha was still a matter of speculation. The GST framework could easily be one of the most important tax reforms for India. It brings with it problems regarding division of taxation powers between the Centre and the states. Which is why the finance ministry had missed a number of deadlines in the past. The implementation of GST will lead to the abolition of other taxes such as Octroi, Central Sales Tax, state-level sales tax, entry tax, stamp duty, telecom licence fees, turnover tax, tax on consumption or sale of electricity, taxes on transportation of goods and services, et cetera, thus avoiding multiple layers of taxation that currently exist in India. The obvious question that arises: what is GST all about and how will it impact us? We present here a brief fact sheet. Goods and Services Tax -- GST -- is a comprehensive tax levied on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods and services at a national level. Through a tax credit mechanism, this tax is collected on value-added goods and services at each stage of sale or purchase in the supply chain. The idea of GST was first mooted by the Vajpayee government when it set up the Asim Dasgupta Committee to study the feasibility and the subsequent implementation of a new form of indirect tax. Vajpayee government went out of power in 2004 and a new coalition, United Progressive Alliance, took over the reins. During 2007-2008 Budget, Palaniappan Chidambaram, then Union Finance Minister, announced that GST would be introduced from April 1, 2010. Chidambaram also said that the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, on his request, would work with the central government to prepare a road map. The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha by the UPA government in 2011, has lapsed and so the Modi government had to come up with a fresh Bill. The GST could not be implemented till now as many states and several political parties were opposing it. States are nervous about the GST as they think the Bill does not address their concerns over entry tax and taxation of petroleum products. Initially, it was decided to keep petroleum products out of the purview of GST. But in the wake of states' opposition, a revised draft of the Constitution amendment Bill put petroleum, though zero-rated, under GST because it is an input product. GST, a value-added tax, gives credit for taxes paid on inputs. The states argued that if petroleum is kept out, it will break the chain for input credits. Also, for the tax to be implemented, the Constitution had to be amended and a consensus needed to be reached with the states. The states objected to the Constitutional Amendment Bill as it did not contain provisions for giving states compensation against any possible loss of revenue after GST roll-out for five years. One of the main concerns of the states was the cumulative revenue loss that they will suffer once Central Sales Tax is removed. Since CST is levied by the Centre on the inter-state movement of goods and is collected by the states, the latter were demanding suitable compensation. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the Centre has allowed states to levy one per cent additional tax on inter-state trade for a period of two years. The Centre has also agreed to compensate the states for revenue loss arising out of GST implementation for a period that may extend up to five years. The GST Bill faced stiff opposition from parties like All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Biju Janata Dal. The AIADMK said it was against it as Tamil Nadu would lose over Rs 10,000 crore (Rs 100 billion) because of the new tax structure. The Congress too recently accused Bharatiya Janata Party of making U-turn and of practising subterfuge, deceit and a hidden agenda. However, the Congress made it clear that it was only opposing the manner of bringing in the GST Bill and not the concept, as the move for GST was initiated by the UPA. Under GST, the taxation burden will be divided equitably between manufacturing and services, through a lower tax rate by increasing the tax base and minimising exemptions. It is expected to help build a transparent and corruption-free tax administration. GST will be levied only at the destination point, and not at various points (from manufacturing to retail outlets). It is estimated that India will gain as implementation of GST would promote exports, raise employment and boost growth. In the GST system, both central and state taxes will be collected at the point of sale. Both components (the central and state GST) will be charged on the manufacturing cost. This will benefit individuals as prices are likely to come down. Lower prices will lead to more consumption, thereby helping companies. GST will not be an additional tax. CGST will include central excise duty (Cenvat), service tax, and additional duties of customs at the central level; and value-added tax, central sales tax, entertainment tax, luxury tax, octroi, lottery taxes, electricity duty, state surcharges related to supply of goods and services and purchase tax at the State level. The tax-rate under the proposed GST would come down, but the number of assesses would increase 5-6 times. VAT regulations and rates generally vary across states. States at times undercut rates to draw investors. This leads to a loss of revenue to both the state and the Centre. GST would introduce uniform taxation laws across states and different sectors. No. In short term, it may lead to higher inflation rates. But prices are expected to fall in the long term as dealers might pass on the benefits of the reduced tax to consumers. According to A K Bhattacharya, Editor, , far from creating a barrier-free pan-Indian market for smooth transaction of goods and services across the country, the GST system may well create new tax hurdles. Instead of improving tax compliance, there could be a strong incentive for tax payers to avoid the higher tax burden to be imposed by the new system, Bhattacharya wrote in one of his recent columns published in . The tax base too may not widen because of the many items that would be excluded from the GST chain, he said. And, most important, instead of enhancing the value of the country's economic activity, the proposed GST system may well be a dampener for achieving higher growth in gross domestic product. GST is likely to have a negative impact on small businesses, especially those in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector. The fear is that once GST is implemented, they will end up paying more tax than ever, which may force them to shut shop. Needless to add, MSME sector is an important contributor to the growith of India's GDP. The GST is likely to exclude potable alcohol, tobacco etc. The future of the Bill is still uncertain. For, despite the support of Trinamool Congress, the government is a minority in Rajya Sabha. However, The Biju Janata Dal, which had been opposing the Bill, joined the Trinamool Congress in dropping its demand that the constitutional amendment Bill for a goods and services tax be referred to a parliamentary standing committee on finance. This could pave the way for the Bill to overcome the Rajya Sabha hurdle.  Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were eager to get the GST Bill passed as according to an estimate, Indian economy will gain $15 billion a year if the GST is implemented. With globalisation, it is necessary that India's economy aligns with the best international practices. And this is where an efficient taxation system is a must. An inclusive tax system like the GST may be the answer.",

The Day After: Yang Still Open To Deal; Angry Instiutionals; Shareholder Lawsuits Start,"Not that this is a surprise, since analysts have been saying since this weekend that the no is not the final no. Yahoo (NSDQ: YHOO) CEO Jerry Yang now says that it was Microsoft who left the negotiating table, and that his team was still open to discussing a deal. In an interview to Reuters , he said: If they have anything new to say, we would be open  I am more than willing to listen. Yang said he had spoken to many Yahoo shareholders since Saturday, and their reaction been all over the map. Yang said he is taking Ballmers withdrawal letter at face value and doesnt know if this is a negotiating tactic. My view is we are moving on and they said theyre moving on, he added. Meanwhile, the shareholder lawsuits have started, as expected: the first one out of the gate are two public pension funds represented by law firms Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP and Bouchard Margules & Friedlander, P.A. The two pension funds are Police & Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit and the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit. Details here . Then, the big institutional shareholders of Yahoo seem to be angry, this WSJ story says : Im extremely disappointed in Jerry Yang, said Gordon Crawford, a portfolio manager at Capital Research Global Investors, which owns over 6 percent of Yahoos shares. I think he overplayed a weak hand. Then Yang, also in an interview to WSJ, did the dialback: We as a company and I personally have always been open to a deal with Microsoft and I hope that the last few days it was clear that we have shown were willing to do a deal with Microsoft but that we couldnt get to an agreement on price. Update : The Yang tour continues: NYT reports on Yangs version of a Ballmer rejection: They chose to walk away after we put a price on the table, and they didnt want to negotiate.  From my perspective, we were open all along to selling to Microsoft (NSDQ: MSFT). We just feel Yahoo, either stand-alone or with Microsoft, is worth more than what they put on the table. Of course, it was Microsoft that raised its bid and Yahoo that dug in on the much higher price. And more from Crawford, challenging the Yahoo account of shareholder react: I would love to know who these shareholders are.  it",

10 things you need to know in markets today,"REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir A man is silhouetted against a giant Turkish flag in Istanbul airport, Turkey, July 16, 2016, following the failed coup in the country last week. Good morning! Here's what you need to know in markets at the start of the week. Japan's SoftBank has agreed to buy ARM Holdings for 23.4 billion ($31 billion), the Financial Times reports on Monday, citing two people familiar with the negotiations.  FTSE 100-listed ARM, which provides technology for the iPhone, is a major presence in mobile processing, with its processor and graphics technology used by Samsung, Huawei, and Apple in their in-house designed microchips. Royal Bank of Scotland is in a strong position despite the Brexit vote, according to its CEO. Ross McEwan told the Guardian in an interview: ""This is not a banking crisis ... We've got plenty of liquidity. We're open for business. We've got plenty of money to lend."" Asian stock markets are pretty steady overnight. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index is down 0.11% at the time of writing (6.30 a.m. BST/1.30 a.m. ET), Japan's Nikkei is up 0.68%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng is up 0.12%. Britain's biggest companies are beset by doubts about the future after last month's vote to leave the European Union and have slashed their investment plans, according to a survey on Monday that bodes poorly for the economy. Some 82% of CFOs from FTSE 350 and large private companies expect to cut capital spending in the next year, the biggest proportion on record and up from 34% in the first quarter, accountancy firm Deloitte said. The number of shoppers heading to British high streets and retail centres fell at the fastest pace in more than two years in June, with the weeks around the country's vote to leave the EU hit particularly hard, a survey found. Retail footfall across Britain was 2.8% lower than a year earlier in the five weeks from May 29 to July 2. This was the sharpest decline since February 2014 and down from a 0.3% increase in May, a survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed on Monday. Central London homes are undergoing a wave of discounting as sellers give up on their previous asking prices after the Brexit vote. The Financial Times reports that the number of cuts to asking prices surged by 163% in the 12 days following the referendum compared with the 12 days beforehand, according to figures from LonRes, a research firm. But recruitment specialist Reed Group says demand for new staff has flourished since the referendum, with 150,000 more jobs added to its website in the past three weeks compared with the same period last year. The Mail on Sunday reports that James Reed, chairman of the 1 billion-plus turnover group, said the 8% increase was a sign that it was ""business as usual"" despite fears that job vacancies could drop. Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, gave a speech in Port Talbot, Wales, in which he described how his thinking about economic inequality in the UK has changed since the 2008 crisis. ""So far at least, this has been a recovery for the too few rather than the too many, a recovery delivering a little too little rather than far too much,"" he said. ExxonMobil has made a bid worth at least $2.2 billion (1.6 billion) for Papua New Guinea-focused InterOil, winning the support of InterOil and topping an offer from Oil Search. ExxonMobil's move pits it against French giant Total SA, which is backing Oil Search's offer with an agreement to buy part of InterOil's stake in the potentially lucrative Elk-Antelope gas field. Dan Cobley, the former Google UK MD who now leads the fintech practice at London-based venture builder Blenheim Chalcot, nails why more and more fintech startups are partnering with big banks rather than competing with them. ""I think there's been a recognition that the cost of acquisition has been way too high for there to be a reasonable payback for most products and services,"" he told BI. ""You can get to that scale much more quickly by partnering with a big business.""

SK Telecom-Helio-Virgin Mobile Deal Done; Helio To Be Injected Into VMUSA: Report,"So reports FT this evening , citing sources. We first broke the news on the deal talks last month, and after hiccups in valuation and other issues, the deal has been signed in principle and that an announcement could be made as early as this week. The deal will include Helio, now majority owned by SK Telecom (NYSE: SKM), injected into Virgin Mobile USA (NYSE: VM), and better-recognized Virgin brand will be retained. VMUS, which did its IPO on NYSE last October, will issue new shares, leaving SK Telecom holding close to 20 percent of the equity of the enlarged business, which will be worth about $50 million, the story says. SKT will also invest a nominal amount of cash in VMUSA. Virgin has about 5.1 million mobile customers, all of whom are on pay-as-you-go dealsHelio has about 200K, all post-paid. Will this deal make any material difference to VMUSAs chances of surviving in the long term? It will certainly give it some cash, and the Korean expertise in handset and advanced mobile service, for whatever that is worth. It will also give VM an entry into higher end handsets, higher ARPU customers, and better UI that comes with Helio, if they decide to use that. Distribution and still-relatively smaller scale remains an issue Possibly the best analysis and rationale of a merger comes from one of our commenters, who posted this in response to a previous post on Helio store closures: 1. Savings in operations by merging overlapping areas such as IT. This can reduce Helio",

Core Strength as a Leader Bren Brown says Its not about winning. Its not about losing. Its about the courage to show up when there are no guarantees. And I feel thats the most important characteristic for any leader to be successful. If the choice is between comfort and courage or between the side-lines and making a difference; I prefer the latter. Distinctive Decision Making Partnerships are more important now than ever. Theres a challenge and opportunity in front of us and we have to change the way we do things. Over the years, I have realized that partners prefer to work with a vendor who invests in their overall growth. In addition to this, partners want to move into new markets and expect the vendor to help them move up the value chain. Its also the vendors responsibility to create new market leads, generate demand and enable partners to capitalize on new market opportunities. We believe in empowering our partners to move up the value chain to become a solutions provider in their own right. Over the past few quarters, we have significantly increased our channel efforts to augment partner capabilities by providing leading practices, tools, and knowledge transfer, which in turn enable them to have more repeatable, successful, and profitable customer engagements. Vision on Indian IT In India we are seeing the rapid convergence of mobile, social, data and cloud which is in turn driving the digital disruption in the country. Already today you can book a cab from your phone, do a money transfer over Whatsapp or order groceries online. The Internet of Everything and the enabling of digital disruption is the biggest disruption today.

Googles Russian Ad Buy Blocked On Technicality; Putins Spanner In The Works?,"Russias FAS anti-trust authority has blocked Google (NSDQ: GOOG) from gaining a foothold in the countrys booming online advertising business. Top-three portal Rambler in July agreed to sell its Begun contextual advertising firm to Google for $140 million. But the authorities on Thursday said Google did not provide all the necessary information to clarify financial aspects of the deal. A translation : (There was) no documented information about individuals that may influence the business group Google, nor a complete list of persons belonging to the group Google, including registered and/or outside Russia. The lack of complete information about the group Google does not fully reflect the effects of the transaction, but may also indicate a limitation of competition due to a decrease in the number of business entities. Its either a cock-up (Google got the paperwork wrong) or a conspiracy (might there be those who wish to keep Russias nascent market for domestic eyes only?). President Putin is reluctant to let the US company dominate Russia as it does elsewhere, a Rambler source told business daily Vedomosti . Either way, its a further regulatory blow to Google, which this month said it would delay its deal to supply ads to Yahoo (NSDQ: YHOO) after all, while DoJ negotiations continue. Thats currently drawing close attention from the department and is likely to get the same from the European Commission. Rambler was due to buy from investor Finam the 49.1 percent of Begun it didnt own, then flog it to Mountain View. Googles now studying the response and considering a re-submission.",
STOCKS GO NOWHERE: Here's what you need to know,"REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Stocks finished the final day of the month - but the first week of a shortened holiday trading week - with a mixed finished after rallying last week during some of the lowest trading volume days of 2016. First, the scoreboard: Dow: 17,802, -71, (-0.4%) S&P 500: 2,098, -1, (-0.05%) Nasdaq: 4,948, +14, (+0.3%) WTI crude oil: $49, -0.7% 10-year Treasury: 1.844% US Economy It's a busy week for US economic data and Tuesday got us started with five pieces of headline economic data to start the week. Kicking things off this morning was the April report on personal income and spending , which showed incomes rose 0.4% in April - in-line with expectations - while spending rose 1%, the biggest one-month jump in six years and more than the 0.7% increase that was expected. This report also contained the Fed's preferred ""core"" PCE inflation reading, which excludes the more volatile costs of food and and is part of the prices measure in the quarterly GDP report, which showed prices rose 1.6% over last year in April. The Fed is targeting 2% inflation. ""Net, net, consumers picked up the pace in April so you know the entire economy cannot be too far behind,"" said MUFG's Chris Rupkey following the report. ""They were much less cautious, and much less uncertain, the presidential primaries be damned."" Following the income and spending report was the March reading on home prices from S&P/Case-Shiller , which showed home prices in the US rose 0.85% month-on-month and 5.43% over the prior year. ""The economy is supporting the price increases with improving labor markets, falling unemployment rates and extremely low mortgage rates,"" said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Down Jones Indices. The Chicago PMI reading for May fell to 49.3, indicating a slight contraction in manufacturing activity in the American Midwest during the month. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index for May fell to 92.6 from 94.7 last month, widely missing expectations for a reading of 92.6. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board said this report indicated that, ""consumers remain cautious about the outlook for business and labor market conditions."" Dallas, Millennials Elsewhere in economic data on Tuesday, the Dallas Fed's May report on manufacturing was another stinker. The reading came in at -20.8, indicating continued contraction in economic activity in the region which has been severely impacted by the decline in oil prices seen over the last nearly two years now. Of note in this report, however, was commentary from one business owner who just can't even with the millennials in their workplace. ""We have a serious productivity problem with office workers and estimated that less than 50 percent of their time is spent on value-creating business activities. The younger workers are often off task, engaged on social media, on the internet, texting on phones and other unproductive activities ,"" this executive said. These comments came as part of a longer riff on how the Department of Labor's new overtime rules will require employers to pay overtime to anyone making less than $47,476 per year, double the previous threshold. This executive's complaint added that all these lazy millennials, basically, will now need to be micromanaged since they can't, it seems, just sit at work for more than 40 hours sort of half-doing the work they're supposed to without being paid for it. Also in labor news, the Verizon labor strike that saw 40,000 employees walk off the job during April and May could impact Friday's jobs report . Jesse Hurwitz at Barclays cautioned that there isn't necessarily a one-to-one equivalency between striking workers and the impact to Friday's headline payroll number due to the hiring of temporary workers, though Bloomberg expectations - currently for payroll gains fo 160,000 - reflect some expected impact. Trump Presumptive Republican nominee for president Donald Trump held a wild press conference on Tuesday. But looking past the sort of day-to-day drama of Trump's out-of-nowhere rise from laughingstock of the campaign to one vote away from the White House, Business Insider's Josh Barro argued in a great column on Tuesday that Trump, for those of you who think about things in financial market equivalencies, is the ultimate tail risk candidate. ""Trump calls for a huge risk premium, because while he probably wouldn't be a disastrous president, the low-probability disasters he might cause would be immensely costly,"" Josh writes. ""Some of them involve nuclear weapons and global mass deaths. Pricing those risks in properly should push his share price comfortably below Clinton's, even if you think she is very bad."" Here's a fun chart: Josh Barro/Business Insider Like any risky investment, a Trump presidency presents a range of possible outcomes, some worse than others. Earlier this month I argued that Trump , for the political world, represents the learning of a lesson financial markets (in theory!) learned from the meltdown of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. Which is another way of saying Trump broke the model and proved that ""The Party Decides"" sorts of political maxims about what can and cannot happen in politics do not apply absolutely. Josh's column takes this argument a bit further, looking at what he thinks would be the actual distribution of outcomes inside of a Trump presidency. You might disagree with any or all of Josh's argued outcomes under a Trump administration, but it is this sort of distributional thinking that I expect will become a major part of the discussion in the coming months.

"The story of BPLs amazing comeback, riding the online wave on the shoulders of Flipkart","For Ajit G Nambiar, Chairman and Managing Director of BPL, June 2015 was a month of excitement and nervousness. BPLs new line of 32-inch televisions were going on sale on Flipkart and the one-time large appliances leader was about to see the unveiling of its first product in over 10 years. On the day of the launch, Ajit and his team of merry men were glued to their computer screens monitoring the customer response from BPLs Dynamic House office on Church Street, in the heart of Bengaluru. By end of day, the answer was clearBPL was back! Within a quarter of the launch, the five-decade-old company was contributing almost 10 per cent of sales in the television category for , and about five percent in overall appliances. BPL is now among the top three brands for Flipkart in the segments they operate in. It is one of our largest brand success stories, says Amit Bansal, Head of the large appliances category at , and the man responsible for bringing BPL on board. The partnership between Flipkart and BPL came about thanks to the lack of interest shown by Indias big-three consumer durable brandsLG, Samsung, and Sonyto try online retail. The big three didnt want to work with us. But we still needed to add value to our consumer. So how do we do that? This was the question Amit, who joined Flipkart in 2014 after spending about a decade in North America and then three years at Reliance Retail in India, had on his mind at the start of 2015. But, in true retail industry style, Amit backed up the crazy idea with market research on what consumers remember most about these brands. The core customer who buys large appliances is in the 30-35 or over-35 age group. Most of these customers said they had a TV or fridge or washing machine in their parents house that was BPL and still working well. Many even remembered their old tag line  Believe in the Best. It was very exciting to see that, recalls Amit. That is how Amit reached out to BPL and its Chairman Ajit in early-2015. . Once a market leader, BPL found itself unable to compete with then new entrants like LG, Sony, and Samsung in the 2000s. Battles within the family for control of the Group didnt help matters either. Its technology partner Sanyo was also in trouble and finally in 2006-07, BPL got out of the large appliances business. From then, BPL focused on its medical equipment vertical and the consumer electronics side focused on home automation products and solutions. But the rise of intrigued Ajit and he kept close tabs on the sector over the last couple of years. While it took a few meetings for the two companies to finalise the partnership, Ajit did not need convincing about the potential of the sector. When we stopped distribution, a lot of our dealers called us and told us they didnt understand why we stopped as the demand had not ceased. When we met Flipkart and Amit last year, we realised that online is now a better model and it was growing very fast. We decided we would get back with our brand, says Ajit. But getting back into appliance production was a completely different story. BPL had sold off most of its factories and the old local suppliers no longer existed. The world also had moved to outsourced production. This is where Flipkart stepped in. BPL and Flipkart had decided to do a trial run, with limited models and limited number of units. Large OEMs and suppliers typically do not supply such small numbers, but Flipkarts backing convinced the suppliers. BPL carved out a team from its home automation business and hired a few specialists. The BPL team worked very closely with the Flipkart team to come up with the specifications and features of the first television. But creating a product that fits customer requirements and making it available is only one part of online retail. Consumer appliances, even todays lightweight TVs, are not easy to transport to every nook and cranny of our vast country. Then, there is the added complication of installation and after-sales service. Flipkart had learnt of these issues the hard way. The e-commerce giant had first launched this category in 2012. But while sales were reasonably good, customer experience was adversely affected due to bad delivery, installation and after-sales service. Within a few months, Flipkart shut down this category. So, in 2014, when Flipkart decided to take a look at this category again, they went about building the supply chain part first. Flipkarts Amit says they realised pretty quickly that bulky goods cannot be shipped using the regular supply chain infrastructure. The company set up dedicated warehouses only for TVs and large appliances in , Kolkata, Delhi, and Mumbai. Also, the shipping is primarily handled by in-house logistics arm and a handful of specially selected platinum logistics partners. For installation and after-sales, Flipkart acquired , a startup offering appliance repair and maintenance service in late-2014. BPLs Ajit says such facilities help brands like his on the ground. With orders coming in from across the country, BPL works closely with the Jeeves team to ensure quick installations and resolutions to any customer complaints. We have weekly meetings with Jeeves and have a small window into their MIS. We ensure we are on top of things, says Ajit. With the success of the pilot, BPL has worked on its new range. A new 32-inch TV has already been launched and a 40-inch and a Smart TV are ready for launch. While televisions will be the focus segment, the company will also have a limited range of refrigerators, washing machines, and air-conditioners. We will first focus on building up the volumes, then marketing and investing in R&D and production, says Ajit. From being a legacy brand, BPL has now become a new-age online-only brand and Ajit sees this characteristic continuing. For both Flipkart and BPL, the collaboration has meant greater ambitions. With success stories like BPL, Vu and Sansui under its belt, Flipkart has set its sights on being the most dominant large-appliance online marketplace in the country. BPL, which was targeting Rs 50 crore from its first year of sales, has now revised the target to Rs 70 crore after seeing the initial response. This is the only thing the flagship company will be focussing on. That is how important the large appliances business is for BPL, says Ajit. And on what the consumer response to seeing BPL back means for him, Ajit says: I am overwhelmed.",

The Bengal Famine: How the British engineered the worst genocide in human history for profit,"The British had a ruthless economic agenda when it came to operating in India and that did not include empathy for native citizens. Under the British Raj, India suffered countless famines. But the worst hit was Bengal. The first of these was in 1770, followed by severe ones in 1783, 1866, 1873, 1892, 1897 and lastly 1943-44. Previously, when famines had hit the country, indigenous rulers were quick with useful responses to avert major disasters. After the advent of the British, most of the famines were a consequence of monsoonal delays along with the exploitation of the countrys natural resources by the British for their own financial gain. Yet they did little to acknowledge the havoc these actions wrought. If anything, they were irritated at the inconveniences in taxing the famines brought about. The first of these famines was in 1770 and was ghastly brutal. The first signs indicating the coming of such a huge famine manifested in 1769 and the famine itself went on till 1773. It killed approximately 10 million people, millions more than the Jews incarcerated during the Second World War. It wiped out one third the population of Bengal. John Fiske, in his book The Unseen World, wrote that the famine of 1770 in Bengal was far deadlier than the Black Plague that terrorized Europe in the fourteenth century. Under the Mughal rule, peasants were required to pay a tribute of 10-15 per cent of their cash harvest. This ensured a comfortable treasury for the rulers and a wide net of safety for the peasants in case the weather did not hold for future harvests. In 1765 the Treaty of Allahabad was signed and East India Company took over the task of collecting the tributes from the then Mughal emperor Shah Alam II. Overnight the tributes, the British insisted on calling them tributes and not taxes for reasons of suppressing rebellion, increased to 50 percent. The peasants were not even aware that the money had changed hands. They paid, still believing that it went to the Emperor. Partial failure of crop was quite a regular occurrence in the Indian peasants life. That is why the surplus stock, which remained after paying the tributes, was so important to their livelihood. But with the increased taxation, this surplus deteriorated rapidly. When partial failure of crops came in 1768, this safety net was no longer in place. The rains of 1769 were dismal and herein the first signs of the terrible draught began to appear. The famine occurred mainly in the modern states of West Bengal and Bihar but also hit Orissa, Jharkhand and Bangladesh. Bengal was, of course, the worst hit. Among the worst affected areas were Birbum and Murshidabad in Bengal. Thousands depopulated the area in hopes of finding sustenance elsewhere, only to die of starvation later on. Those who stayed on perished nonetheless. Huge acres of farmland were abandoned. Wilderness started to thrive here, resulting in deep and inhabitable jungle areas. Tirhut, Champaran and Bettiah in Bihar were similarly affected in Bihar. Prior to this, whenever the possibility of a famine had emerged, the Indian rulers would waive their taxes and see compensatory measures, such as irrigation, instituted to provide as much relief as possible to the stricken farmers. The colonial rulers continued to ignore any warnings that came their way regarding the famine, although starvation had set in from early 1770. Then the deaths started in 1771. That year, the company raised the land tax to 60 per cent in order to recompense themselves for the lost lives of so many peasants. Fewer peasants resulted in less crops that in turn meant less revenue. Hence the ones who did not yet succumb to the famine had to pay double the tax so as to ensure that the British treasury did not suffer any losses during this travesty. After taking over from the Mughal rulers, the British had issued widespread orders for cash crops to be cultivated. These were intended to be exported. Thus farmers who were used to growing paddy and vegetables were now being forced to cultivate indigo, poppy and other such items that yielded a high market value for them but could be of no relief to a population starved of food. There was no backup of edible crops in case of a famine. The natural causes that had contributed to the draught were commonplace. It was the single minded motive for profit that wrought about the devastating consequences. No relief measure was provided for those affected. Rather, as mentioned above, taxation was increased to make up for any shortfall in revenue. What is more ironic is that the East India Company generated a profited higher in 1771 than they did in 1768.  Although the starved populace of Bengal did not know it yet, this was just the first of the umpteen famines, caused solely by the motive for profit, that was to slash across the country side. Although all these massacres were deadly in their own right, the deadliest one to occur after 1771 was in 1943 when three million people died and others resorted to eating grass and human flesh in order to survive. Winston Churchill, the hallowed British War prime minister who saved Europe from a monster like Hitler was disturbingly callous about the roaring famine that was swallowing Bengals population. He casually diverted the supplies of medical aid and food that was being dispatched to the starving victims to the already well supplied soldiers of Europe. When entreated upon he said, Famine or no famine, Indians will breed like rabbits. The Delhi Government sent a telegram painting to him a picture of the horrible devastation and the number of people who had died. His only response was, Then why hasnt Gandhi died yet?""       This Independence Day it is worthwhile to remember that the riches of the west were built on the graves of the East. While we honour the brave freedom fighters (as we should), it is victims like these, the ones sacrificed without a moments thought, who paid the ultimate price. Shed a tear in their memory and strive to make the most of this hard won independence that we take for granted today. Pledge to stand up those whose voice the world refuses to hear because they are too lowly to matter. To be free is a great privilege. But as a great superhero once said, With great freedom comes great responsibility.",

Ten interesting things we read this week,"t Ambit we spend a lot of time reading articles that are not directly        relevant to Indian stocks. However, since the Indian economy is now        umbilically linked to its global counterparts, the articles that we   come      across have relevance for Indian stocks and the Indian   economy. In     that  context, this report contains the ten most   interesting pieces   that   we  read this week. Here are the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week, ended July 29, 2016. 1) How can India bridge the gap between its middle and median class [Source: LiveMint ] Does the proverbial middle class in India refer to the median population between the rich and poor or is it more of a socio-political construct? According to the existing research and statistics, the latter is more likely to be the case. The 2011-12 data from India Human Development Survey (IHDS) indicates that Indias middle class was less than 6 percent of its total population. Astonishingly however, 49 percent of the respondents identified themselves as middle class. The article also captures how at an all-India level, the median household in 2011-12 owned only one of the five assetsa motor vehicle, a TV, a computer or laptop, a cooler or AC and a refrigerator. Further against the common notion, the median class is still engaged relatively more in manual work, rather than in the so-called white-collar jobs. 2) How solo star fund managers stack up against the team players [Source: Financial Times ] To avoid the exit of investors en masse as a star fund manager leaves a fund house, funds are now being structured to avoid the emergence of star managers, with most mutual funds run by two or more individuals. However, according to a recent research due to be published in CFA Financial Analysts Journal, placing a team in charge of a fund is not necessarily good for investors. As per the research, funds with a single manager significantly outperform those run by teams on averageby up to 1.3 per cent a year. Also, funds run by a single manager have a higher expense ratio than funds with two or more managers. But even these higher costs were not enough to offset the additional returns single-manager funds offered. 3) Why Unilever really bought Dollar Shave club [Source: Bloomberg ] According to this piece, the key to Dollar Shave Clubs appeal is not so much its online prowess but the fact that it built a powerful brand in four years. Dollar Shave Club upended the industrys traditional business model by offering a subscription service that sells blades for as little as $3 a month (including shipping and handling). The company learns about its audience and curates messages specifically meant to keep them engaged. The blending of a cheap and convenient product with entertaining content helped the company snatch customers away from traditional razor sellers. As per the article, while Unilever and P&G are masters at traditional marketing, they struggle with the direct-to-consumer brand-building at which upstarts like Dollar Shave Club excel. 4) A few useful mental tools from Richard Feynman [Source: farnamstreetblog ] This article lists seven tricks of trade highlighted by renowned physicist Richard Feynman in his series of lectures in 1963, which were later memorialised in a short book called The Meaning of it All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist. These tricks show Feynman taking the method of thought he learnt in pure science and applying it to the more mundane topics most of us have to deal with every day. 5) Missiles will be quicker to make as 3D printing blasts off [Source: Financial Times ] 3D printing is making rapid inroads into the missile manufacturing business. In March, the US Navy tested a Lockheed Martin-manufactured missile with a 3D printed component and next year MBDA, the European missile-maker, will use a printed part in its Sea Ceptor missile system. According to the article, the component which flew on the D5 missilea cover to protect cable connectors was designed and manufactured in half the normal time. Going forward, additive layer manufacturing, as 3D printing is known, could make enhancements more feasiblefor example reducing weight to make room for other systems or to deliver greater range.

After the success of his first master plan written 10 years ago, this plan revolves around addressing the need for sustainable energy. Some of the salient features include creation of a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product, expanding the electrical fleet from consumer cars to heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport, and allowing for your vehicles to be used in a sharing economy wherein these cars can be used to generate income for you (much like Uber) while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. 7) The chronic spin that blights Chinas economy [Source: Financial Times ] As per this article, a wholesale breakdown in the reliability of financial information in China is exacerbating the misallocation of capital that lies at the root of the countrys waning economic efficiency and burgeoning levels of corporate debt. Right from media reports that are unreliable considering the journalists can be bought out to credit agencies that have awarded investment grade status to 99.5 per cent of all public debt outstanding, there is a dearth of sources which can help the lenders weed out value destroying firms. 8) Indias search for policy economists [Source: LiveMint ] The appointment of Harvard University economist, Gita Gopinath, as an adviser to Kerala chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has led to the usual political drama. Leftist ideologues have angrily asked how a communist chief minister could seek the advice of a neoliberal economist. This article brings forward three issues highlighted by the current series of events: 1) India needs a new generation of policy economists to replace an older generation whose greatest achievement was the first generation of economic reforms 2) It is important that quality advisors are appointed in the state government rather than center, given the lack of quality policy thinkers is an especially acute problem in the state capitals 3) India needs to create a new policy ecosystem that encourages the best economic talent to stay behind in Indian universities, think tanks and research institutes so that we dont have to rely on foreign talent. 9) Can we stop ageing and live forever! [Source: LiveMint ] Immortality as a concept is no stranger to human beings. Called nectar in English, or amrita in Sanskrit, even a sip of this elusive elixir is supposed to make humans immortal. This article describes the case of Elizabeth Parrish, chief executive of a Seattle-based biotech company BioViva USA Inc, who claims to have become the first human being to be successfully rejuvenated by gene therapy. Parrishs BioViva isnt the only one chasing the elusive elixir of life.

Six Apart finds a pot full of VC Dollars,"EXCLUSIVE : Our friends at Six Apart are about to get another big round of venture funding. It is their series B round of funding, and the lead investor in this round is said to be August Capital. Augusts capital wont be much of a surprise for the two entities have old linkages. For instance, former August Capital partner Andrew Anker is now an Executive Vice President of Corporate Development. The amount of money raised is still under a shroud, though I am told it could be well over $5 million, a modest investment when compared to Silicon Valleys free spending ways of the past. ( Press release says $10 million ) Many of my better sources in Silicon Valley say that there was a good chance of Sequoia Capital participating in the round, but obviously that did not pan out. I have sources telling me David Hornik of August Capital spearheading the investment, and is likely to join the board of the company. The Trotts obviously are not talking, and neither is rest of the senior management. I had tried getting in touch with Hornik but he would not say. Anyway I am pretty certain of the news. Six Apart had received an undisclosed amount of money from Joi Itos VC fund, Neoteny . Reid Hoffman, a member of the founding team and former executive officer of PayPal is also an investor. The company has been on a tear and recently signed a deal with Nokia where Nokia camera phones (ugly as they might be) play nice with TypePad, SixAparts hosted service.",
Fox Mobile/Jamba CEO Lucy Hood Resigns; European Focus Going Forward,"Fox Mobile/Jamba (part of News Corp. (NYSE: NWS)) CEO Lucy Hood has resigned this morning, we have learned through sources, and now confirmed by PR. Jamba COO Lee Fenton will be the interim CEO until they find a new replacement. Updated : the company has now issued an official release , after stonewalling us for the last three hours on queries. The release says she wants to do more entrepreneurial ventures, but there has to be more than that: earlier this year she was appointed the CEO of the Jamster venture, in which News Corp. holds joint stake with Verisign. She has been with News Corp. for more than a decade, helped launch Fox Mobile Entertainment in 2005, and then this JV with Verisign. More in extended entry Staci adds : Yes, there is more to it although even this may not be all of it. According to one source familiar with the situation, the company is still very bullish on mobile but theres a sense now that the operation probably needs to be run from Europe rather than LA. Most of the staff is based in Berlin and the business/opportunity is more Europe (and Asia) for now than in the U.S.. Hood traveled a great deal but was still based in the U.S. Fenton, who was hired as COO to lead worldwide operations, has the European know-how: he was director of consumer platforms for Vodafone (NYSE: VOD) prior to joining Jamba and before that was commercial director of Vivendi (EPA: VIV)-Vodafone JV Vizzavi. Hes held a variety of senior positions at other companies and could well be the top candidate to run Jamba on a permanent basis. This source stressed that Hood is respected as an executive but her departure is likely to fuel some critics who didnt see her as the right candidate to head the 600-plus employee JV, which was far bigger than Fox Mobile. Update : Some more details: Fenton is assuming Hoods responsibilities but technically wont be known as interim or acting CEO. I am told by another source in a position to know that he is a serious contender for the CEO job but there will be a search . Fenton was supposed to be LA-based when he was hired but that shifted. Its uncertain now whether he will be based in Europe or U.S. during this transition. The structure going forward has yet to be determined. As this source put it, there probably will be some fallout; I don",

Bullet train projects: A $51 billion gold mine in making for MSMEs,"MUMBAI: The proposed Rs 98,000-crore along with the that seeks to build 6,000 km of high-speed rail network, can create a whopping USD 51 billion business opportunity for the MSME sector, says a report. If the government makes 30 per cent mandatory sourcing from Micro Small and Medium Enterprises for these projects, it can create a USD 51 billion window of opportunities for the sector, according to the report by domestic agency . A whopping USD 168 billion will be spent over the next 10 years, if the projects go as planned, it said, adding that they can change the face of in terms of technology absorption and innovation, apart from creating a large channel of funding opportunities for them. Collectively 28 per cent MSMEs in the special purpose machineries, fabricated metals and printing among other sectors will gain from these mega projects, provided the government makes it mandatory to source 30 per cent of inputs from them through an offset clause. If so, this can unleash nearly USD 51 billion for the sector. Citing the MSME ministry's assessment, the report said that such an offset clause will see over 24 per cent of the fabricated metal producers gaining, while for non-metallic producers (12.5 per cent), special purpose machinery makers (12.1 per cent), textile companies (8.9 per cent) and close to 8 per cent structural metal producers gaining. This will be achievable provided the projects involves manufacturing MSMEs in the project,which can create immense value for the sector in terms of aiding the gross capital formation (GCF), an important indicator of the extra value created over existing fixed assets, says the report, adding currently, the for the MSME segment is only USD 52 billion. These projects can help MSMEs gain an additional 3.7 per cent of their annual manufacturing GCF due to the cheap additional debt made available through the projects. In terms of fund needs, the bullet train network can potentially add 1.5 per cent to MSMEs' debt shortfall over the next 10 years, the report said, adding despite this there will still be an additional debt gap of USD 19 billion for them. While many analysts have questioned the viability of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, the report estimated that at USD 1,600 per capita income, the country is better placed than Japan which rolled out its first Shinkansen (bullet train) in 1964 between Tokyo and Osaka, when its per capita income was only USD 1,346. Japan has agreed to fund USD 12 billion to the project at 1 per cent interest for a 30-year tenor.",
